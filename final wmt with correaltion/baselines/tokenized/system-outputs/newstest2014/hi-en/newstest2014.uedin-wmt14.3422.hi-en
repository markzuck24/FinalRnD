the black box in your car ? &quot;
while the road planner of the united states , the saga highway system for the shortage of funds are wondering if , there are many people from the small and a solution in the black box , which is on the dashboard of your car as to fit .
this device , which is run by the driver of a motor-vehicle salavasi every mile of the track and the information is transmitted to the authorities , the main streets of the united states , today &apos;s finance - who have been to the old system to restoration of washington and the state planning office for a controversial has become an issue of the effort .
usually highway as boring work is also planning a deep and lively debate has become an issue of alliances .
you have the drive by a mile , and probably has the drive to keep details of the place - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - the government to use these black box in favor of giving permission for securing support liberatarian with environmental groups .
the tea party is bhauchkki .
the american civil liberty union also take the different kinds of privacy issues , is very worried .
while the congress , this could not agree on the fact that there is need to take further action or not , many don &apos;t wait for the state .
they are doing this discovery that in the next decade , how they can be in such a system , in which the driver on the road fixed to pay for each mile .
thousands of motor-drivers for a test drive has already has taken the black box , which in some of the gp s. monitoring .
it is , in fact , for our country is an object .
&quot; it was elected by us or not , it is not a matter of being elected . &quot; this is to say that the south california of ikhrata hasan , the government is executive director of the union , which until the year 2025 motor-drivers in california fixed by every mile of the track to start planning .
we can pay by a change in the way of this is going to be .
it is the technology to do .
the main reason for this is that the highway trust fund around the country has become insolvent , whose finance-up at the gas pump by the american citizens to pay the taxes .
the american people don &apos;t buy the gas before now .
now a gallons of gas in the car more miles from the past .
in the federal tax a raise in the last 20 years , which is 18 . 4 cents per gallon .
the high price of gas for politicians , even a penny increase in the tax to sobriety .
transport policy expert at the university of minnesota lee munich says , &quot; is not quite swahney the gas tax . &quot;
the state of their per-mile payment system to test the recently in tracking device shyesta 500 cars .
he says , &quot; in the longer term , the most reasoned will work in the form of options . &quot;
wonks mileage-based user fees , it says .
it is not surprising that the urban liberals think this is good , because it , for example , the car to a change in the ways to be a change in the tax , which is to reduce the jam and greenhouse gas reduction can help in the country .
the california planner are eager for this system when he was the state &apos;s mahatvakankshi a target set out in the global warming legislation to assist fully developed .
but the head of the interior transport committee , die . shuster ( to the bill . - wapda a. ) , the black box also the most vyawahare long-term option .
also , the independent vendors in the region foundation per mile by the drivers are in favor of the payment .
vice-chairman of the policy in the region , adrian moore said , &quot; this is not the only such a tax , which is being in the blind well . &quot;
the people who are trying to get something , the more direct way for her payment .
in this campaign , the two former american transport is also support the secretaries , who in the year 2011 , with the congress in his report per-mile proceed in the direction of the payment of grace .
the u.s .. the senate has a 90-million dollars in the last year &apos;s test was approved of the project , including 10 , 000 cars would have been involved .
but the rural law-makers on the concerns of the work , which is a representative of the hanguraja people who go to work every day , or in the city a lot more miles to go to walk , the leadership of the house , the proposal to end on .
however , many of the state and the city itself forward in this direction .
it is the most keen regan , who in the use of the country &apos;s largest 5 , 000 are listed by the driver .
it is the driver of the state soon mileage instead of the gas tax will pay the fee .
nevada had already completed the initial test .
the new york city is also in this direction is moving forward .
illinois on a limited basis , with the trucks azmis .
and i-95 alliance , including the eastern seaboard with 17 state transport department ( maryland , pennsylvania , including virginia and florida ) are included , the study of the fact that they are doing what kind of implementation of this change .
this idea has not found support all the places .
in nevada , where some time ago 50 voluntary car on the cars of the drivers to this device had been planted , the driver can think this was very impatient that the government to monitor his every step .
nevada strategic and work in the department of transport - to be directed to the performance management , alauddin khan says , &quot; big brother and the same kind of worry about the other things was the main problem . &quot;
this is not such a thing , which the people wanted .
the test with proceed , nevada &apos;s a. c. l. uk , was given a warning on its website : &quot; these are the full tracking device to change in the device will be easier to a great extent . &quot;
huge , aprbandhniy technology to develop the structure-structure is not a requirement , which came the day of every person-to keep a record of being a falana was inevitable .
nevada from those in many states , which is to get a sustainable technology is trying to do , with the help of the state that this could get the details of the fact that the car is going on how many miles per day , but it &apos;s not that where and what time it is going .
khan said that if you can do it , so people can feel more comfortable . &quot;
the search of this technology to some state agencies to miles , a small start-up of california .
the firm basically by the state to help drivers was not in the business .
this auto insurance at the customa attempt to enter the market was doing , in which the drivers on the basis of their miles had to pay .
but this is a device which is tested , it was good to yojana highway , because it gp s. does not use and is very limited information , which uploaded by modem at the interval of time .
the main adisase rayon true mileage morrison said , &quot; if you have the speed of the people and not to track their location , they have to opt in this way will be more willing . &quot;
in these early programs of the state , some big mistakes .
to do so much less lavish and also the way to reduce the intervention .
in oregon , the planner of the drivers different options are using to .
they gp s. with or without a gp s. you can choose the device .
or any of the device can choose not to , but by the residents of the state to decide on the basis of the average miles can choose to set fees .
there is hope to other places that instead of the less in the device and concerned citizens by providing more facilities to determine if it can be now .
in new york city , a transport official efforts to develop taxing device , including parking meters to pay the fee will be the same , &quot; according to his drive payment &quot; will provide insurance , and the other from the operators of the real time speed will create a collection of data which qadianist motor-drivers to avoid traffic .
the city planning has been mentioned in the document , &quot; motor-drivers it because of the benefits it will be attracted to the participation . &quot;
however , some of the yojana transport is a surprise that perhaps miles of the discussion on the payment of the great fervour .
san francisco metropolitan transport commission in the gulf region , has said that the increase in the gas tax and the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund very easy to tackle the problem .
the hybrid or other cars on the drivers of the additional one-time or even the annual fee can be ayes , whose vehicle was very much do not use gas so that they pay the right side .
the legislative commission and the director of public affairs , randy rentshelr said , &quot; when the aspirin may work out for him , what is the need of the amulchul surgery . &quot;
if we do that , the driver of the car after his privacy and other for many things will be worried .

frontier airlines carry-on baggage lugage of the
frontier airlines passengers on board his aircraft in the goods for carry-on to the store to 100 charge .
frontier airlines in a carry-on bags for the 100 for the charge is a scheme to start and this , coffee or soda lugage duty of 2 , even though its announcement on wednesday said that the passenger can keep the entire box .
the new carry-on fees for bags , in an bin is , therefore , a small bags under the seat deceives free .
frontier said that the 25 will be charged if paid in advance unless it is called , will have to wait for 100 to pay if the passenger wait until they are at the gate .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos; improved said that the passengers in advance unless 100 fees charged to care is to be achieved .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to the charge , &quot; he said .
airlines , in 2008 , the first and second checked bags , for the charge .
the passenger duty to who are trying to escape the bharai are doing what they can do in the baggage carry-on , which is stash in an containers , it means this is often less space in the box .
the passengers on board for the duty to bring at least one way .
o &apos; improved said that this is a new charge of raising money is not in fact .
this is frontier &apos;s most loyal customers that it became an bin space has become increasingly difficult .
airbus &apos;s own website , the passengers who buy tickets in this not to give it .
this means that is why the next person in line for a similar bags can give 100 dollars , while a frontier , a passenger in line at the gate , one can get a free bags .
o &apos; improved said that the frontier &apos;s website and check these procedures are being changed to the gate of the passengers before getting to know about the fee to ensure .
the frontier new carry-on fees , will not start until the summer , although a date has not been set .
passengers often baggage duty and other fees in the unrest , but the airline prefer them .
they argue that the baggage money is spent for , and those who want to passenger service they should pay for it .
the baggage fees on wall street in the form of an indication many see that many airlines after years of deficit ariel to cover the cost of travel for money to charge .
although the majority of the carry-on bags , are not even touched fees .
spirit airlines inc . , carry-on fees for three years ago started for the first time , and fellow discounter allegiant air later .
with such a tax and other airlines hungary &apos;s wizz air , which airline consultant j. sorensen said , and that the aid-on fees track .
he said that the spirit carry-on fees of 50 million a year brings in december 2011 , which is estimated in the report .
sorensen , a former official of the midwest airlines has recently filled with flight in the spirit and the passengers at the gate carry-on unusual bags , is to face the fee with surprise .
&quot; the boarding process that i had seen in his airbus career was easy , &quot; he said .
&quot; i pisano and a war between the teeth at the gate was expected to see out .
&quot; the plane was full , and he said that it was established lickety-split . &quot;
even the frontier coffee , tea , soda or juice stands spirit &apos; 2 for the fees .
frontier nacha that passenger soda , juice stands will take or they can keep the whole box , and this is the only free coffee will be for a time .
this will give away from the water again .
us airways , in short , for the drinks in 2008 tried to charge , but after a complaint of passengers in the seven months after he backed away and any other major airlines after the there .
the frontier &apos; s passenger if the airlines do not buy directly from the carry-on fees charged on the frontier to this step towards their own website to run to customers , is his latest effort .
airlines online travel seller does pay to orbitz this kind of 10 to 25 each for the tickets have been unsubstantiated .
that is why all the airlines , an online travel agency , instead of going through those people to buy directly from the passengers to run an incentive .
though the frontier , went ahead in this area .
in september , many at a distance of often sortie miles to more than half for those customers , one of these people had purchased from the online travel agency
the wednesdays trip miles miles award reduced to 25 per cent .
so , an online travel agency has bought a thousand miles from the frontier trip will acquire a distance of 250 miles .
it is also the fact that they only buy directly from the frontier website but only for passengers to choose their seat in advance .
frontier &apos;s denver , in his home in the city is a loyal base of customers , but its business is being squeezed , and this is being lost money .
the decline of 9 per cent in revenue , and its flight capacity of almost 13 per cent in the first quarter have been reduced , the corporate parent of the republic airways holdings inc , according to financial results released on wednesday .
a part of the sale of the republic airlines in the form of frontier &apos;s finance trying to decide .

the scientists on this issue and has put the light that the antics of the tail of the dog and then what is the relationship between in the mood .
previous research has found that the naved dog his tail are more shake the right ( the dog ) , while the restless dogs to their tail mainly are more left to shake .
but now scientists say that the fellow dog-tailed this can identify the subtle differences and can express their response .
in this study , published in the journal current biology .
trento neuroscientist professor from the university of georgia vellrtigra said : &quot; all of this in humans know very well that the left and the right part of the brain that in the excitement , including the different manner that generated the positive or negative feelings . &quot;
here , we also in the other species , it has decided to see .
he said that even in the dogs , like humans , the right part of the brain antics of the left hand and was responsible for the opposite order , and in the spirit of two golarddhon has played different roles .
in this regard to know more than that the dog and other dogs how on the unilateral move by the reaction , the researchers see films of the other dogs tracked the animals .
he was the heart of the domestic dogs measured the dhadkan and analysis of their behavior .
we understand , probably did not take more time in that one side of his tail , on the other hand , why is shaken .
prof. vellrtigra said : &quot; we have the dogs with the films of the dog-realistic version presented or uljhan who in other issues to deal with in the images , and we could see the tail and the tail can submit the left or right . &quot;
when the animals to their tail a stolid dog on the right ( the dog ) saw shake , they are completely from the rest .
but when he was tailed by changing the direction of the left side of the main form of a dog ( again ) looked like , his heart was increasing and they dhadkan uneasy .
prof. according to vellrtigra they don &apos;t think that the dog through these antics intentionally dialogue with each other .
instead , they think that the dogs , it is learned from his experience that they must be worried at the harkat what and what is not on .
he said : &quot; if you want to get to the other dogs have many times , and if they continue to only one side of the tail flicking , it is associated with a more friendly behavior , and the right part is less dostana behavior , you have the same reaction on the basis of experience . &quot;
the researchers say that these conclusions owners , animal trainers and doctors about the feelings of the animals can provide better information .
university of bristol &apos;s school of veternary sciences &apos;s guest fell , the dog &apos;s behavior expert john bradshaw said that its test for this is not the first study that the dogs to the left or the right part of the important or not .
last year , university of lincoln &apos;s team found that when the dog see an aggressive dog , the left side of his head like a dog , and are happy to see his head on the fund on the right .
the university of victoria in canada in the other research , he said : &quot; in contrast to the italian study - when the robot dog &apos;s tail hilly on the left than the right , then the dogs , instead of being eager to get close to her was more likely . &quot;
he said that this was because of a difference because the dog films in various studies in animals or the robot dogs don &apos;t understand fully the dog .
he made it clear that there is a real dog by the dogs to the reaction to the study of the ways they can help .
&quot; while this thing from the different mammals found a lot of evidence that the two parts of the brain , different purposes is used for , to get more detailed information is still the rest - and this is not an exception in the case of a dog , &quot; he said .
however , easily their behaviour which can be filed , he watched think that we could not possibly more time to understand that their tail ever , on the one hand , on the other hand , why is shaken .
the new research , it turns out that we have all the time in the morning , work with honesty and dedication .
don &apos;t lie , and spoke with a theft or deception to think in the mind .
but the evening are known to change our minds and we put an ideal one side is to go against the law .
harvard university and auto &apos;s david ackles school of business , the researchers in this research of the many interesting facts .
according to researchers , are not the tension of the work in the morning , we prefer to moral values , but the evening fatigue or more pressure because of honesty .
researchers for this , the two .
he said some people from the number of points on the computer screen to tell said .
for instance , it was to tell the people that the point is more on the left or the right .
those taking part was said that if they have the right to give the wrong answer instead of the answer , they will be given money .
this was seen in the experiment that morning between 8 to 12 , who was used on the people he was not a mistake , and the right answer .
at 6 o &apos;clock in the evening from 12 noon between people use at the time was found that he greatly on the dresser his intentionally wrong answer .
this researchers this proved to be that morning our sincerity to the greed for money , but no matter , but in the evening we can close to tuzo morality .

to the disappointment of the voters of obama clamour
i expect the change obama twice in the voting .
he says that the g o. p. due to the policy of resistance of obama &apos;s great efforts have been interrupted
the policy is the miserable obamacare website , drone can &apos;t excuse of attacks .
the year of 2008 , obama &apos;s memoir reminds one of those things that could be ?
nathaniel wapda morris harvard medical school in the second year student .
i was very sad to read the books .
this is such a book , which i think that this is the second year of medical school will my utsahvarddhn during the sorrow and jgayegi ray of hope in me .
the name &quot; the courage to win , &quot; and this is the year of barack obama in the 2008 presidential election campaign is sanmarka .
when i was in the night of his patients i could furasta from leaflets and i called on the bed , this book i take in a period , in which the politics was inspired millions of people and put your breath to demonstrate that the speech .
achraf proved to be the elections , and the news of the speakers at the time of historical importance to pause .
in the eyes of my chapatis there were tears of joy , and my parents had to each can save the newspaper .
a group of young visionary people was being the white house , and the whole country was ready for a change .
in the year 2008 , during the presidency of barack obama , they have 82 per cent approval rating .
and then i closed the book . &quot;
the current reality is a hard truth , such as returning to the world of dreams .
the hope to those days is difficult to remember - to remember the one away as they are , have lost a bitter memory of the opportunities .
my first time voting by proposing a change in fact after the .
in a simple example , there is no could not even imagine .
i obama to give credit to the many accomplishments , affordable care act to the withdrawal of our forces from iraq , &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell &quot; osama bin laden with the end of the jeejah to go .
besides , i believe that the policy of discriminatory against our country &apos;s many efforts to proceed is stopped in the immigrant reform , the public option for the health service , at the guantanamo bay airport to close , and the other .
but the asankya time in which i his colleagues and comrades canada take the obama administration - will i have the answer to this is that i can give them .
the political i reached the point of despair .
the republican foreign policy , the leaders of the opposition of the detective is not the answer , nor in the countries of the drone attacks on innocent children is the answer .
it was built by the national security agency , the ordinary american citizens about the private life to save the data can &apos;t answer is not only incorrect antics of the government to the people of the prosecution on the north .
this is a u.s. citizen without any trial for the murder of anwar al awlaki may not tell the reason , nor are less during the president &apos;s public fund and the expenditure limits .
the conclusions of the report that it did not give the north , which is to say that the media by the white house &apos;s efforts to quiet &quot; after nixon administration until now , the most aggressive . &quot;
and most recently , this , affordable care act signed into law three years of a simple website after the failure of the design can &apos;t excuse .
i don &apos;t know whether i was the only hope it .
if , in the 18 years of age , i should take a guess that the system of governance , the political campaign to bring forward it &apos;s khadija .
it is evident that the elected office is not the way to a predictably , because the opposition political parties and random events such as newtown massacre , we will be provided by the size of the public discussion .
however , i have given up as the example , they were chosen for himself by the administration .
this is the most upset you .
i , for obama voted again in 2012 , but not because i was very excited from his opponent .
the romney lost to a confused and presented an uncertain option , which is that his policies or they don &apos;t like to determine the post to .
i realized that a second term for obama , which is that the future will be free from the pressure of elections , they will complete the expectations we &apos;re listening to a long time .
however , while obama &apos;s anumeadn rating this week is less than the 45 percent , through the book return in the year 2008 has become very difficult . &quot;
he reminded me of his memory of wanam almost disappeared .
in this week to read a part of the book , which was described how pennsylvania because of obama in the primary , the clinton nahua was very big losses .
the meeting in a post-piety . &quot; he said to his subordinate employees that they need to get back on track , and satanist stay on his motives .
he said , &quot; i want to get back to their mojo . &quot; .
we need to remember who we are . &quot;
today , five years later , the president sir , i could not agree more and you .
this idea constabulary expressed in comments nathaniel morris .

the aircraft has been made to the previous department√¢ - especially what is equal to sitting 9 or 10 more capacity of keeping in mind the davao mini jumbo jets &apos;s design is being prepared ?
boeing says it is &quot; 777 x &quot; 406 people who have made 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the department will economics .
airbus says the a350 rush , with 350 people put equal to 18-inch dropped 9 will be taken in the seat .
in the press plane veteran often trade advertising through prahaar trade on technical matters .
now , the airbus 777 x ratio in dubai with more than 100 order is expected to dominate the , it can appeal to the public to come forward .
in the recent this is being seen as the start of the war vigiyapn also be some of these financero with one showing that one in three and one with delhi are you doing this ?
airbus sales chief john leahy said , &quot; boeing regional turbo also from long-distance flight in snkrisiton is presented , &quot; he said .
in the form of change , even if the people are getting bigger , but the plane has not changed the way to sit .

&quot; they don &apos;t want to tell us know whom he has the advantage of . &quot;
he is aware of their business better in comparison of someone else .
for fliers this is in connection with an elbow room , but the supplier for the fast is an issue that it can affect the income .

kevin keniston , europe &apos;s airbus passenger facility &apos;s head says , &quot; boeing &apos;s aircraft to our products to them , and to create a more competitive and more seats for the effort is doing . &quot;
on the other hand , analysts say the entire 10-seat - per line cabin suggestions for the current 777 s is that many of the passengers is in favor of denser layout , which along with cheap fares can be .

even the world jet vendors vie this layouts carefully to check on the measures .
more rest , but also all the builders jet planes , the airline &apos;s low cost and high density for a regional tour to death layouts .
a 10 provoiding airbus a350 equal , but says it is not yet sold .
but until recently , the airbus needs more cabin facilities for some of its jet planes , but the emphasis on the larger cabin seats .

by the time the first youth : soon to be big
research shows that african-american and hispanic girls gori of his age , in comparison with the girls in the age can get youth .
the physical changes this does not mean that the youth is near
this is not any evidence of the fact that the hormone or any other chemicals may be given to blame
the experts believe that the obesity indignation , in the age of puberty may be one reason .
by the time the first case of the youth is not as effective in the boys&apos;
cnn recently . the former press pat etheridge children &apos;s health and family issues are expert journalist .
whether the mother should be worried , if his daughter was 7 or 8 years of age , in the development of the breasts and genital hair to start out ?
rolando this week , the american children &apos;s medical academy in florida &apos;s annual conference in bal therapy endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz clarified that these initial physical change is a common phenomenon in the american girls , it &apos;s the new fashion show .
kaplowitz says , &quot; i &apos;m very little time to rely on their parents that i &apos;m in - that this is usually quick progress in the direction of the youth don &apos;t count . &quot;
the visible symptoms such as the development of the breasts to amkuriat , vagina and cash hair and physically smell from the time the first signs in the girls .
but in the past four decades , the first monthly-religion rjodarshan ( ) was very minor changes in the age of .
united in the states , the average age of 12 . 5 years , which is in the year 1970 12 . it was 75 .
&quot; when there are beginning to be developed breast , the first rjodarshan at least two to three years . &quot; kaplowitz , which &quot; pre-time in the girls &apos; : this is a common problem guide necessary to deal with . &quot; is also the author of the
the development of youth , the most accurate test is time .
what is the beginning of the youth , there is a debate in this regard , but when the first of the eight years of age with the development of the breast is two tri &quot; child-pros &quot; says .
in most cases , it will be a slow process will be stopped - whose hair or a physician can inspection from the next .
in the case of a more rapid progress of the investigation by the endocrinologist may need so that serious problems like assist tumors or the possibilities of could be overcome .
pre-time monthly-religion and other if the results are the treatment to : the remains of the time - the former age-growth , due to which the undeveloped growth and nata stature in the form of an adult .
the drug or hormone constution for treatment , the age of a child , the growth rate , the growth rate , and are dependent on the emotional waskita .
there are also important psychological aspect .
caplovithj are functional about drugs , but accept , &quot; the youth to suppress vywaharatmk issue is great , and the girls to feel different from his colleagues can take . &quot;
the other big problem can be understood : guardian just don &apos;t want that his age , the daughter of the monthly-religion .
caplovithj said , &quot; the risk of pregnancy , they worry about , or how it is that they will maintain cleanliness . &quot;
one woman , whose daughter , 10 years in the umra monthly religion was the beginning , remember , &quot; it was a shock . &quot;
although there were signs of this matter and we have monthly - will also talk about religion , but she was not ready emotionally .
he was scared . from his school and worried that she pulled him in the first menstrual was started .
about the causes of premature puberty in suprchlit theory .
however , it is not a consistent evidence that milk or other food-hormone in the products , the chemicals in the environment or yaunonmukhi messages in the media could be charged .
even the boy - the girls - time - are trying to get the former youth .
caplovithj these rules are determined that the main reason for this is the hiv epidemic of obesity .
he was in the year 2001 , six to nine years of the study on top of the girls to run , which the body fat to associates with the time of youth .
the other results support this conclusion , but there are many other contributions are also a factor .
in this country , african-american and hispanic death gori his age in the girls from the girls to get the first youth trend .
this is a clarification of the matter .
at the global level , the time-replica of the former youth , ranging from the economic conditions and the weather and jeans , with all the things .
the other puzzle : though the boys face and genital hair in age , but full of girls as the youth is not clear .
a. a p be present in the conference , the other doctors jtiltaoen &apos;s support of the subject .
even in the babies and children also muhane and genital hair has become common to be seen .
morristown , in-goryeb children endocrinologist hair surgeon at the hospital , dr. lawrence silverman says , &quot; we need to be careful about is that we are the real start of the youth what kind of identity . &quot;
the opinions in this regard to their parents for their children &apos;s guidance from the physician should not hesitate in taking that how to talk to their children .
the kaplowitz advised , &quot; meaning to the talks before the expected time . &quot;
if you will be quiet , your child will answer from the right .

you can only without the surgery can specify gender , and look after him that how to identify developed .
no one in a child sex will be developed by the way , the science is not very accurate .
this is not the right answer any person can give that is why .
this is a kind of puzzle that why gay people .

in the year 2011 , a catholic country this sukhun dozens of french law-makers from the school books from the &quot; gender theory &quot; to go back to have signed the petition .
the u.s .. the website of the catholic online for germany , it is against the law , &quot; while the world is being in such a state , where sex is a self-elected option , but not sexual activity , we are two of the pillars of civilization and taking in the opposite direction . &quot;
in maryland babies , the baby &apos;s mother joan said that he was at the time of birth to a child sex will like to be specified .
he called on the website in the context of bringing said , &quot; bringing even without the additional limits is very stressful , especially if you don &apos;t know that that is what your child &apos;s sex . &quot;
the stability of the children and the need to .
historically , the man and the woman , both with the vagina , the children who take birth hermaphrodites ( hermaphrodite ) , which is a beautiful greek gods were on the name of which was bisexual .
and even less time with nearly a decade ago , the medical world , the sex was considered in the form of a slate which can be written and then deleted .
but now many people , the surgery is going to be a challenge to ethics , they are trying to understand that the work is complicated gender-identity , and sometimes even from the doctors may be wrong , who don &apos;t know that the children on his penis to a large nirdishtikrn will feel about it .
dresser says , &quot; in the middle of the 20th century , it &quot; marg emergency , &quot; he says .
when these children were born , then you are not used to the psychiatrist , you were called to a half-surgeon .
the treatment of children with genital ambiguous about the current theory of john hopkins university &apos;s dr. john was presented by the money , which is sunirmanniy .
he said the &quot; gender identity &quot; of the word and argued that the social and environmental cues - parents how bringing the child-child interactions with the gene and hormones and that it should be identified in the form of a man or a woman .
but in the case of the year 1966 , called the &quot; john / joanne &quot; is known in the form of , became his theory disputed .
he was a child , whose gender lingagrchrm-ucchedn ( circumcision ) was eventually the sex , the parents of the children that he advised complete bandy and testicle retype drive and brought it to the girl .
dresser said , &quot; money said that in the case of the success of the avastar presented in the form of a case , but he has not done so . &quot;
in the 15 years of age , the children back to their you have changed in the form of a man and a woman in marriage .
but in the age of 38 years , he committed suicide .
dresser said that some doctors still &quot; the same prototype &quot; are doing .
but the year 1990 , in the years after the advent of the internet , these gender surgery to people started to come in front of the &quot; is not happy with the result . &quot;
it &apos;s the same case , the 36-year-old writer jim montana bruce was with , which x , y ; the man was born with the chromosome , but her vagina was ambiguous .
the doctors clearly didn &apos;t understand that he was a small penis , or his bhgshef was big , but he was sure that he was never in the form of a man &quot; life satisfaction &quot; can &apos;t ngo√¢ .
therefore , the year of his birth in 1976 , after some time , the external part of bruce and testicle surgery and given out by bringing him like a girl .
in the 12 years of age , he woman hormone .
he abcnews . from the building and said , &quot; i knew that i &apos;m not a girl . &quot;
&quot; i was not happy , but it was very difficult to question .
in the 18 years of age , was to be vaginoplasty with her .
but the avsadgrst and feel some errors , he sought medical records .
it is frightening reality it detected .
at the time of birth , i was bandy - and no one has never told me .
bruce , d. s. ds was born with , who was in sufficient amounts to his body from making testosterone , which is why her vagina may not develop properly .
after the truth , he became the men back , he took the dose of testosterone and htwa isalmabad your breast .
because of the surgery he was ban .
today , he called the interface project intersex people in the organization , the people about their perception explains to the general .
however , the california-based legal group advocates were pleading for informed choice adisase director of annie tamar-mattis expressed concern that the law of germany &quot; chippy and -rrb- . &quot;
he says , &quot; a lot of activist people think that the law of germany , the parents and the children to take a quick decision &quot; anirdharit &quot; will be inspired to specified . &quot;
we are afraid that this will encourage the intervention .
we think that instead of waiting , the man or woman is a better process to specify gender .
but we don &apos;t know what kind of nibhaega his role the law , so we can only guess .
tamar-mattis said that his organization , the support of the australian law is so because &quot; this is the third gender in adults have allowed . &quot;
he said , &quot; the legal sex adults about their own should be able to take a decision . &quot;
it is the law of germany to specify the time of birth is related to .
it was at this time to thread by the newborn children is not a war .

but pittsburgh &apos;s breast radiologist dr. arlene baratz whose daughter is a nations√¢ the sexual development , and the support of the hundreds of other people in the help of the group , said that the law of germany both parents and children to &quot; will provide the power . &quot;
bharatji &apos;s daughter katy man was born with the chromosomes , but it is a complete androgen asnvednshilta syndrome , d. s. ds .
since there was a defect in the androgen gray , therefore , the woman in the katy traits .
the vagina in his body , but the uterus or dinbgrnthi is not .
now the 29-year-old katy is married and pennsylvania university resident in child psychology in the department .
although the fact that he is ban , but the adoption or gestational surogacy through the hope of becoming a mother .
baratz said , &quot; this is the law of the parents is a facility of this fact that they are not in their you do not take any decision . &quot;
this gives them , &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; by some test before writing to understand the right way and the time .
in this way , you are right - bringing the child , to love with a child .
do you have a lovely child and fun .
we could not be in such surgery is no need to get that may not be back .
he said , &quot; it is in the process of taking the decision brings to the children and parents to the motive is free from anxiety disorder because they did not believe that they are doing ok . &quot;
finally , the child will determine how that he is more comfortable with a sex -- and this will be a very good thing .
this is for the children to their own enables in the decision .

george kerevan euros given the option to the dissolution of the scots
and one day , one of the fear of independence and the story .
this time , we have been warned that the e. uk membership in the form of the condition of the independent travel sector in the whole of europe in the form of an independent scotland would need to .
the passport control on the berwick and hadrian resemble a wire on the walls of the border of the stories about .
it is true that the strathclyde papers with the rest of europe , the potential economic benefits of independent travel in the description , though - as purvanumanit - did not mention it in the headlines .
nor did any of the description that the e. uk member of his time to his formal rules to spend less .
since it is not the schengen area of scotland , in fact scotland from brussels , therefore , who is also wanted , he continued in the return of non-compliance will be cheaper left for brussels .
so , then , non-story . &quot;
and the thing that is limping from such a long time , he has been frozen . first , i &quot; is the meaning of freedom passport control &quot; babaniyaz news was heard about 40 years ago .
however , this interesting to the old story again was lost in the interesting point .
even though the europe from an independent scotland bidding why should expect to ?
the brussels yoke of london &apos;s why for domestic sales , especially now ?
here the real european news : the great to the united europe , finally stopped the plan after the war .
with the euro crisis , the project in europe officially dead .
the entire e. uk in e. the uk , or the euro in the form of a common currency for the party to close to gain strength .
even in germany also yuroskeptil alternative for germany , the party - which is only this year , suddenly in the federal election in september and nearly five million votes were received , and thus free democrats ( smtuly of our own libaas dems ) out of the bundestag effectively .
the federal plan to the construction of europe &apos;s always has been the domestic opposition .
however , the current economic crisis proved to be a radical privrtancark .
berlin , and have been installed by the european central bank , with strict rules , the common currency through to compliance with the national economies have shyesta barriers on the very people is being compared to think that the project is too far gone to europe .
excessive budget deficit of the national governments in the euro crisis was not much of a role - it is only in the case of greece was the truth .
in fact , the euro system to its members in favor of the german exporters , the currency exchange rate stable-such a thing that want to maintain the german politician .
the domestic currency without the possibility of avmulyn , southern europe , in comparison of his m.k.r.f germany implies that the loss of productivity in the situation .
it is the only way to pay and the public expenditure -- which has been encouraged by the berlin .
the current budget and currency problems much further deep european productivity ruganda .
consumers at the expense of french and german energy firms to provide a rebate to-brussels was shyesta by the &quot; green &quot; energy policies as a result , the european industry , in comparison to the united nations double for electricity and four times the payment for the gas .
this is the cost of the damage to the disabled , which we have already seen in the grangemouth .
everyone in the world could be fries salaries , the european petrochemicals industry cheap u.s .. the shell is not being affected by the gas can be avoided .
as a result , the spirit of revolt in the people again flares up , especially in france , which sometimes e. the uk &apos;s main fans .
after the youth , france &apos;s top politicians e. uk to keep control of the germany , and the paris washington equal billing in the world to offer was seen in the form of measures .
but now the political legitimacy to berlin for the paris in the form of a passport is not needed , and it your own on europe &apos;s economic policies are implemented , because of france &apos;s economy , which has been innocents .
the result : the marine lee payne &apos;s right wing , uk anti-national front has recently customa upchunav in third place in the ruling socialist dhkelte customa victory .
by this time in france front 24 percent of the vote is the most popular with the party - this athsma warning for the british labour is that they can &apos;t make it clear that the dissolution of the left , right to the benefit of haaga .
lee payne french white , working class in the middle of his new found fame is doing what ?
the next year , the group e. uk in the european parliament , the use of the polls . uk rival , the intersection currency wants to create a rival group .
if , as is possible , too , in these elections . uk opposition party is a good performance , the first time this type of group by the european parliament .
my point is this : in europe soon . uk shabbir√¢ and the intersection of anti-currency spirit will the euro .
the bureau , will not end completely , but this futcr &quot; ( arena ) countries of europe , &quot; as will reach back in any form , which will have the support of general de gaulle .
germany and its and some arthvyavasthaan can keep the euro , but france and southern europe will start his mudaran again .
&quot; i expect that the u.s. njdikian with in the hope of increasing the uk himself will away from this project .
however , the pacific washington &apos;s growing interest in the signal that the uk will be left in the cold atlantic .
in what will be the most crusades scotland ?
we have little area of england ( required ) can choose to be made .
the economic interests of his own , or we can protect - including berlin and brussels on the right time to be different .
i think that scotland loose and better performance in the european system can execute , provided that we keep their own currency .
the non-federal countries in europe and other countries who think the same miljulkr will be easy to work with .
otherwise , we norway walking on the road to maintain their economic independence should think about .
scotland in n. p. - ullekhnniy as a government-in europe , the most successful anti-parsimony has been a political campaign , which alistair labor &apos;s chancellor darling proposed ( and ) carried out by the cuts , and the tory-libaas dam after him on the basis of the coalition &apos;s majority in the year 2011 was won .
for scotland this time to vote for independence will be talking nonsense , because in that case it is to be installed by brussels and berlin wall will have to accept the rules of parsimony .

this conclusion , which is a leading businessman was seen in the levels of the groups , said that the businessman was a &quot; significant change &quot; inspire , which is that the uk . it lost power to give back .
it is a very high price - a treaty change for britain and to get a better deal with the issue in a referendum , the uk in favor of staying perched in the 16 percent of change .
the prime minister must be not in any doubt this survey is that the british businessman dasharatha , uk in terms of britain &apos;s membership at the summit to support his plan .
it also showed that the businessman , the current balance of power in the uk . in favor of a significant change to customa punvarta than to do .
