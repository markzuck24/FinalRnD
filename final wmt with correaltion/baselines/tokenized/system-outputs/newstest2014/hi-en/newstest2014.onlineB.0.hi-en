true mileage some state agencies seeking this technology , a small california start-up - brought to .
the firm originally was not in the business of the state to assist drivers .
the auto insurance was trying to enter the emerging market in which drivers had to pay for your mileage .
but it is testing the device , it seemed appropriate to highway planners , because the gps you do not use and provides very limited information , which is periodically uploaded via modem .
true mileage chief executive ryan morrison said , &quot; if you people do not speed and track their location so they will be more willing to adopt this approach . &quot;
there have been some big mistakes in these early programs in the state .
to do this , there are much less expensive and less intrusive .

they gps with or without gps the device can choose .

scientists shed light on the subject and the antics of the dog &apos;s tail and the relationship between mood .
previous research has shown that much happier dog shake their tails to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while the restless dog shaking its tail are mainly left over .
लेकिन अब वैज ् ञानिकों का कहना है कि साथी कुत ् ते पूंछ के इस सूक ् ष ् म भेद को पहचान सकते हैं और उस पर अपनी प ् रतिक ् रिया व ् यक ् त कर सकते हैं ।
the study has been published in the journal krnt bayloji .
georgia neuroscientist and professor at the university of trento vellrtigra said : &quot; in humans it is well known that the brain &apos;s left and right part of the stimulus individually include ways to generate positive or negative feelings
here we have tried to look at other species .
उन ् होंने बताया कि मनुष ् यों की तरह कुत ् तों में भी मस ् तिष ् क का दायाँ भाग बाएँ हाथ की हरकतों और विपरीत क ् रम के लिए जिम ् मेदार था , और दो गोलार ् द ् धों ने भावनाओं में अलग-अलग भूमिकाएं निभाई ।
इस बारे में अधिक जानने के लिए कि कुत ् ते अन ् य कुत ् तों द ् वारा एकतरफा दुम हिलाने पर कैसे प ् रतिक ् रिया करते हैं , अनुसंधानकर ् ताओं ने अन ् य कुत ् तों की फिल ् में देखते जानवरों पर नज ़ र रखी ।
he measured pet dogs and their behavior analyzed in a heartbeat .
we probably will not take long to understand that why shaking his tail is sometimes one side , sometimes on the other side .
pro.वेल ् लरटिगरा ने बताया : &quot; हमने कुत ् तों को कुत ् तों की फिल ् मों के साथ पेश किया - यथार ् थवादी संस ् करण में या उलझन में डालने वाले अन ् य मुद ् दों से निपटने के लिए छाया-चित ् र में , और हम पूंछ की हरकत को देख सकते थे और पूंछ को अधिक बाएं या side could have rendered . &quot;
when the animals right on his tail in a deadpan dog ( dog terms ) seen shaking so they are completely comfortable .
but when he changed direction , mainly on the left side of the tail ( re dog terms ) rotating saw his heart beating fast and he looked nervous .
pro . vellrtigra not think the dog through these actions were intentionally communicate with each other .
instead , they think dogs have learned from experience that it should be concerned on how they act and what not .
उन ् होंने कहा : &quot; यदि आप दूसरे कुत ् तों से कई बार मिल चुके हैं , और यदि वे अपनी पूंछ को लगातार ही एक तरफ हिलाते हैं तो यह अधिक दोस ् ताना व ् यवहार से संबंधित है , और दायाँ भाग कम दोस ् ताना व ् यवहार प ् रस ् तुत करता है , आप उसी अनुभव के based on that feedback . &quot;
researchers say these findings owners , veterinarians and trainers can provide better information about the feelings of animals .
यूनिवर ् सिटी ऑफ ब ् रिस ् टल के स ् कूल ऑफ वेटरनेरी साइंसेज ़ के अतिथि फ ़ ेलो , कुत ् तों के व ् यवहार के विशेषज ् ञ जॉन ब ् रेडशॉ ने बताया कि इसकी जाँच करने के लिए यह पहला अध ् ययन नहीं है कि कुत ् तों के लिए बायाँ या दायाँ भाग महत ् वपूर ् ण है या नहीं ।
पिछले वर ् ष यूनिवर ् सिटी ऑफ लिंकन की टीम ने पाया कि जब कुत ् ते किसी आक ् रामक कुत ् ते को देखते हैं तो अपना सिर बाईं ओर घुमाते हैं और खुश कुत ् ते को देखने पर अपना सिर दाईं ओर घुमाते हैं ।
other research at the university of victoria in canada , he said : &quot; in contrast to the italian study - the robot dog &apos;s tail wags the right side than the left side , then instead of being restless dogs were more likely to get near him . &quot;
he said the difference was because the animals or robots in various studies in dogs movies dogs were completely understand dogs .
he explained how the dog reacts to the study of real dogs can help .
&quot; जबकि विभिन ् न स ् तनधारियों से इस बात के काफी सबूत मिले हैं कि मस ् तिष ् क के दो भागों का अलग-अलग उद ् देश ् यों के लिए उपयोग किया जाता है , अधिक विस ् तृत जानकारी प ् राप ् त होना अभी भी बाकी है - और इस मामले में कुत ् ते अपवाद नहीं हैं , &quot; उन ् होंने said .
हालांकि , जिस आसानी से उनके व ् यवहार को दर ् ज किया जा सकता है , उसे देखते हुए लगता है कि हमें यह समझने में संभवतः अधिक समय नहीं लगेगा कि उनकी दुम कभी एक तरफ तो कभी दूसरी तरफ क ् यों हिलती है ।
new research has revealed that in the morning we work with honesty and dedication .
do not lie or cheat and steal from someone you do not have to mind .
but the evening turns our minds and we seem to run against the norm of law is put aside .
harvard university school of business and uto david acls researchers in this research are many interesting facts .
researchers said the stress of the work day was not much we prefer moral values ​ ​ , but honestly the evening because of fatigue or pressure decreases .
researchers used for two .
some people , he asked for the number of dots on a computer screen .
for instance , the point was to tell people is on the left or on the right .
participants were told that if they give the wrong answer rather than the correct answer them money to be offered .
इस एक ् सपेरिमेंट में देखा गया कि सुबह 8 से 12 के बीच जिन लोगों पर प ् रयोग किया गया उन ् होंने कोई गलती नहीं की और सही जवाब दिया ।
people between 6 pm to 12 pm on the experiment found that while putting aside his principles intentionally answered incorrectly .
इससे रिसर ् चर ् स यह साबित करने में कामयाब हो गए कि सुबह पैसों के लालच से हमारी ईमानदारी पर कोई फर ् क नहीं पड ़ ता , लेकिन शाम होते ही हम नैतिकता को तवज ् जो देना बंद कर देते हैं ।

natheniyl p. morris , a second-year student at harvard medical school .
nowadays i am very sad to read books .
this is a book , which i think it will encourage me during the second year of medical school nostalgia and hope in my jagayegi .
the name &quot; dare to win &quot; and the 2008 presidential election campaign of barack obama is snsmrika .
जब मैं रात में अपने रोगियों के पर ् चों से फुरसता पाता हूँ तथा बिस ् तर पर जाता हूँ तो यह किताब मुझे एक ऐसे दौर में ले जाती है , जिसमें राजनीति ने लाखों लोगों को प ् रेरित किया था तथा भाषण आपकी सांस को रोककर रख सकते थे ।
the choice proved aside , and news of the speakers then took pause to reflect historical significance .
there were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates , and my parents took to save each receive newsletter .
the white house was a team of young visionary individuals , and the nation was ready for a change .
during obama became president in 2008 , he had a 82 percent approval rating .
and then i closed the book .
the present reality is a harsh truth , as come back from the dream world .
hope is hard to miss those days - they seem a distant memory , a tragic reminder of lost opportunities .
after i did the first time voting actually changed .
to put it in simple as could not imagine any of this .
i &apos;ll give obama credit for many achievements , the affordable care act , our troop withdrawal from iraq , &quot; do not ask , do not tell &quot; from the end to the killing of osama bin laden .
इसके अलावा मैं विश ् वास करता हूँ कि पक ् षपाती विरोध करने की नीति ने हमारे देश के आगे बढ ़ ने के बहुत से प ् रयासों को रोका हैः जिसमें अप ् रवासी सुधार , स ् वास ् थ ् य सेवा के लिए सार ् वजनिक विकल ् प , ग ् वांतानामो बे पर अड ् डा बंद करना , के अलावा और अन ् य शामिल हैं ।
but numberless times in which i find myself in front of colleagues and peers in favor of the obama administration - taking over me the answer which i can give them .
i &apos;ve reached the point of political despair .
republican leaders of the protest spying foreign policy is not the answer , nor is the answer to the drone attacks on innocent children abroad .
यह राष ् ट ् रीय सुरक ् षा एजेन ् सी द ् वारा आम अमेरिकी नागरिकों की निजी जीवन के बारे में डेटा संग ् रहित करने का जवाब नहीं दे सकती है न ही सरकार की गलत हरकतों का उजागर करने वाले लोगों पर अभियोग चलाने का उत ् तर दे सकती है ।

and most recently , the affordable care act , signed into law three years after the failure of designing a simple website can not excuse .
i do not know what i had expected it .
if , at the age of 18 , i must assume that the system of governance , political campaigns deny that it may bring forth .
there is a predictable way that is directly elected office , political party and random events occur , such as anti carnage of newtown , we will provide the public discussion .
the examples i have given above , however , they appear to be mostly chosen by the administration itself .
it bothers you most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was enthralled by his candidacy .

premature puberty : growing up
research shows that african - american and hispanic girls younger than her age , blonde girls attain puberty .
the physical changes of puberty does not mean that it is nigh
there is no evidence that this hormone or any other chemicals may be to blame
experts believe that obesity outbreak , the age of puberty may cause
case of premature puberty in boys is not as effective
cnn pat ithrij the former bbc journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
what mother would be worried if her daughter at the age of 7 or 8 of the breasts and genital hair growth to get started ?
this week , orlando , florida at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics , pediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplovitj clarified that the initial physical changes are common in american women , they represent a new trend .
kaplovitj says , &quot; i - i spent a bit of time to assure parents - that rapid progress towards full bloom usually not reflect it . &quot;
the development of direct signs sprout breasts , genitalia and bodily odor hircus looking girls prematurely .
but in the last four decades menarche ( first monthly - religion ) changes in age is very slight .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , which was 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; if you start developing breast menophania takes at least two to three years , &quot; explains kaplovitj the &quot; time in girls - pre puberty : the essential guide for dealing with this common problem . &quot; the author
puberty is a time of developing the most accurate test .
what is the beginning of puberty , there is debate about this , but with the growth of breast development before the age of 8 are two of the &quot; child - adult , &quot; he says .
in most cases , this process will stop or slow down - the hair doctor can inspect it closely .
in case of more rapid progress एन ् डोक ् राइनोलॉजिस ् ट examined by tumors or cysts as may be required in order to remove the potential for serious problems .
time - prior month - religion and other consequences of delaying treatment : the bones of the time - before age - growth , resulting in stunted growth and as adults may be undersized .
drug or hormone treatment recommendations for the child &apos;s age , growth rate , growth rate , and depend on the emotional adulthood .
psychological aspects are also important .
kaplovithj aware of drugs , but admits , &quot; suppressing puberty can increase behavioral issues , and girls may seem to feel different from their peers . &quot;
the other major problem is clear : parents just do not want their youngest daughter monthly - religion .
kaplovithj said , &quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy , or that they will maintain the hygiene . &quot;
a woman whose daughter had started menstruation at 10 years umre , recalls , &quot; it was a shock . &quot;
although there were signs of this thing and we have monthly - talk about religion , but he was not emotionally ready .
he returned from school frightened and upset that my friends began her first menstruation .
many theories about the causes of precocious puberty are suprclit .
however , this is not a sustainable evidence that milk or other food - the hormone substances , chemicals in the environment or can be charged to messages in the media yunonmuki .
boys - like girls - time - are pre-puberty .
the rules define kaplovithj it is the main reason for the outbreak of obesity .

other results support this conclusion , but many other factors are also contributing .
in this country , african - american and hispanic girls my age tend to get blonde girls before puberty .
several - the explanations .
at the global level , under-time counterpart of youth , ranging from economic conditions , weather and jeans , all things appear to be affected .
another puzzle : the boy &apos;s face and genitalia are the youngest child , but not entirely clear as puberty , girls have practiced them .
a.a.pil jtiltaoen of other physicians who will be attending the conference theme supported .
even in infants and children has become common to see acne and genital hair .
moristaun , a pediatrician at children &apos;s hospital in new jersey goryeb एन ् डोक ् राइनोलॉजिस ् ट , dr. lawrence silverman says , &quot; we need to be very cautious about how we identify the actual start of puberty . &quot;
अभिभावकों को इस बारे में राय लेने के लिए अपने बाल चिकित ् सक से मार ् गदर ् शन लेने में संकोच नहीं करना चाहिए कि अपने बच ् चों से कैसे बात करें ।
kaplovitj advised , &quot; this may be the time required to negotiate before . &quot;
if you remain calm , your child will usually answered properly .

in maryland , the mother of newborn babies baby john said that he would like to see be assigned gender at birth .
he said about raising website , &quot; without raising additional limitations is very stressful , especially if you also do not know what the sex of your child . &quot;
children need stability and certainty .
historically , born with both male and female genitalia hrmafrodaits kids ( unisex ) was called , which was named after the greek god who all were heterosexual .
and less than a decade ago , the medical world was regarded as the penis slate that can be erased and rewritten .
but now many people surgery is challenging the ethics , they understand that gender identity - is complicated , and occasionally may be mistaken by physicians who do not know that kids grow up specifications will feel about your penis .
dreshr says , &quot; in the mid-twentieth century , the &quot; psychiatric emergency &quot; call .
when these children were born , then you would not have called the psychiatrist , you surgeon was called up .
treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia existing theory about john hapakins university was presented by dr. john money , who were considered sex sunirmanniy .
उन ् होंने &quot; लिंग पहचान &quot; शब ् द की रचना की तथा तर ् क दिया कि सामाजिक और पर ् यावरणीय संकेत - माता-पिता बच ् चे की परवरिश कैसे करते हैं - बच ् चे के जीन और हॉरमोन ् स के साथ अंतःक ् रिया करके निर ् धारित करते हैं कि उसे पुरुष के रूप में पहचाना जाए या महिला as .
but in the case of 1966 , the &quot; john / joan &quot; known as , his theory became controversial .
they have one child , whose gender circumcision ( srkmsisn ) was unknown during the accident , the parents advised his testicles removed by infertile if they are full of children and their upbringing to girl .
dreshr said , &quot; money in a case presented as a successful case of transition , but he did not . &quot;
at the age of 15 , took the child and his back turned as the man got married to a woman .
but at the age of 38 , she committed suicide .
dreshr said some doctors still &quot; followed the same pattern are &quot; .
but in the years after 1990 with the advent of the internet , these penis surgery undergone by men started to come out &quot; not happy with the results . &quot;
the 36-year-old writer jim bruce montana case was with the x . y. was born with male chromosomes , but it was ambiguous genitalia .
चिकित ् सकों को स ् पष ् ट रूप से समझ में नहीं आया कि उसका लिंग छोटा था , या उसका भगशेफ बड ़ ा था , लेकिन वे निश ् चित थे कि वह कभी भी पुरुष के रूप में &quot; संतुष ् ट जीवन &quot; नहीं जी सकता ।
therefore , some time after her birth in 1976 , bruce &apos;s external organ and testicles surgery and removed the girl was his upbringing .
female hormone given to him at the age of 12 .
he told abcnews.com , &quot; i &apos;m not the girl i knew . &quot;
i was not happy , but it was very difficult to question .
at the age of 18 , was supposed to vajainoplasti with him .
but depressed and feel something wrong , she sought medical records .
the frightening truth is revealed .
i was born infertile - and never told anyone .
bruce di.asldil was born with , which prevented his body from making adequate amounts of testosterone , which caused her genitalia did not develop a proper manner .

today , the interface project intersex individuals in the organization to explain to people about their perception is normal .
however , california - based legal group advocates for annie tamr informd executive director of choice - matisse express concern that germany &apos;s law &quot; invites the label and stigma . &quot;
she says , &quot; many people think that germany &apos;s law activist parents and child to make quick decisions &quot; undefined &quot; specified will cause . &quot;
we fear that it will encourage intervention .
we think that instead of waiting , better process to specify male or female gender .
but we do not know how the law will play its role , so we can only guess .
tamr - matisse said his organization supports the australian legislation does so because &quot; it allows adults to be recognized in the third sex . &quot;
&quot; the legal adults about sex should be able to make their own decisions . &quot;
germany &apos;s law to specify that it relates to the time of birth .
at this time it is not a war fought by young children .
grow older , your body can take decisions about themselves .
but pittsburgh breast radiologist dr. erlyne baratj whose daughter &apos;s sexual development disorder , and have helped hundreds of others in the support group , said germany &apos;s law parents and children both &quot; will provide the power . &quot;
baratji &apos;s daughter katie was born with male chromosomes , but the absolute insensitivity syndrome called androgens di.asldil was .
since the defect in the receptor androgens , therefore , developed in katy female characteristics .
in the vagina , uterus or ovary , but her body is not so .
now the 29-year-old katy is married and is a resident in the department of child psychology at the university of pensilvania .
although she is infertile , but that becoming a mother through adoption or gesteshnl surrogacy is expected .
baratj said , &quot; this legislation parent lets the fact that you can not take any decision in haste . &quot;
them , &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female &apos; writing and understanding a reasonable time before trial offers .
this way , you are right - to nurture the child , the child &apos;s love .
enjoy and have a cute baby .
we hurried such surgery do not have to make that can not be returned .
he said , &quot; this decision-making process brings children and parents to motivate free from anxiety because they do not believe that they are right . &quot;
eventually , the child will determine how he is more comfortable with sex - and it would be good .
it enables children to make decisions for themselves .

but min . palmer claimed that the ministers may have conflicts of interest , and he has said . abbott &apos;s daughters may benefit personally from the policies .
min . palmer said , &quot; provides a significant conflict of interest in matters of parental leave may be because none of his daughter is pregnant , she will have a direct interest that may or may not leave them . &quot;

george kerevnः euro disruption given the option to scots
another day , another story of fear of freedom
this time we have been warned that the euकी सदस ् यता की शर ् त के रूप में पूरे यूरोप में स ् वतंत ् र यात ् रा क ् षेत ् र के रूप में शामिल होने के लिए स ् वतंत ् र स ् कॉटलैंड की आवश ् यकता होगी ।
berwick passport control at the border of barbed wire on the walls of hadrian indicate about the stories .
strathclyde is true that the free movement of paper with the rest of europe about the potential economic benefits described , though - as anticipated - headlines not explain it .
no one describes the eu members of your time and spend your formal rules change to suit your needs .
scotland since the schengen area , so brussels from scotland who really wants to get him in exchange for continuous non - compliance affordable to brussels would be exempt .
so , again , non-story .
another thing which has stuck for so long , he has been frozen . i first &quot; freedom means passport control &quot; baseless news was heard about 40 years ago .
however , the interesting point of this interesting old story telling lost again .
independent scotland expect to europe anyway , why should the bidding ?
london to brussels yoke why merchandising should be , especially now ?
great news : the europe to organize a genuine european war - after the plan has finally been halted .
with the euro crisis , europe project is officially dead .
the eu in the eu or opposed to common euro currency are firmly dedicated crew to stop .
even in germany for germany uroskeptil alternative party - has established itself this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election of september came and received , and thus the free democrats ( lib dems have our own equivalent ) effective in
plans to build a federal europe has always been the domestic opposition .
however , the current economic crisis proved a radical conversion .
बर ् लिन और यूरोपियन सेन ् ट ् रल बैंक द ् वारा लगाए गए कठोर नियमों के साथ ही , समान मुद ् रा का अनुपालन करने के माध ् यम से राष ् ट ् रीय अर ् थव ् यवस ् थाओं पर लगाई गई बाधाओं के कारण बहुत लोगों को सोचना पड ़ रहा है कि प ् रोजेक ् ट यूरोप बहुत दूर चला गया है ।
national governments excessive budget deficit was not a great role in the euro crisis - this was only true in the case of greece .
rather , the euro system to its members in favor of the german exporters have stable exchange rate - something that would keep german politician .
without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency , in southern europe than in germany itself finds it in a state of productivity inherent disadvantage .
the only way to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by berlin .
beyond the current budget and currency problems have deep european productivity morbidity .

it &apos;s going to cripple the damage costs , which we already saw in the grangemauth .
be freeze all salaries in the world , the european petrochemicals industry affordable u.s. shell can not help being affected by the gas .
there is a sense of rebellion erupted between people , especially in france , once the eu was a major fan .
uddh eu after france &apos;s top politicians control of germany , and paris wanshigtn equal billing in the world was seen as a way to provide .
but berlin and paris as political validity of the passport is not required , and also their own economic policies on europe , causing the french economy is shaky .
results : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , eu anti-socialist ruling national front in the recent by-election push has conquered the third place .
इस समय फ ् रांस में फ ् रंट 24 प ् रतिशत वोट के साथ सबसे लोकप ् रिय दल है - यह ब ् रिटिश लेबर के लिए यथासमय चेतावनी है कि वे यह मानकर नहीं चल सकते हैं कि बाएं के लिए विघटन , दाएं के लिए स ् वतः ही लाभ हेागा ।
le pen french whites , the working class is doing with his new found fame ?
the team next year eu using the european parliament elections in the eu anti , anti faction wants to make the common currency .
if , as is quite possible , these elections eu if the opposing team do well the first time such a group could affect the european parliament .
my approach is this : in europe the eu soon euro common currency and combines anti-anti-semitism will end .
the euro will not disappear entirely , but the retailer &quot; ( sovereign ) nations of europe &quot; will return to some form of support to the general de gaulle .
germany and the euro economies can maintain a retainer , but france and southern europe will resume their currencies .
i expect the uk . &apos; s expected to increase with proximity to the uk keep yourself away from this project .
however , wanshigtn growing interest in pacific indicates that the uk will be left in the cold atlantic .
after all , what about scotland ?
little england area we ( necessarily ) may choose to remain .
or can we protect our own economic interests - including berlin and brussels is the perfect time to tell you to be different .
i think the european system work better scotland loose - to be performed , provided that we keep our own currency .
non - federal states of europe to work together with other like-minded countries would be easy .
otherwise we walk on the path of norway to maintain its economic independence should consider about .
in scotland s.anlpil government - the ulleknniy - the most successful economies in europe - is anti-political campaign , the labour chancellor alistair darling proposed ( and implemented ) to resist cuts and post-tory - lib dem coalition
this time to vote for independence for scotland would be absurd , because in that case the austerity imposed by berlin and brussels must accept the terms .

according to the report , to commemorate the birth anniversary of sardar patel during the last four years , the upa government has spent rs 8.5 crore .
बल ् कि मोदी के दावों के उलट एनडीए के शासनकाल में ( वर ् ष 1999 से 2004 के बीच ) अटल विहारी बाजपेयी के पीएम रहने के दौरान एक दौर ऐसा जब आया लगातार दो सालों तक ( 2001-2002 ) पटेल के ऊपर सरकार द ् वारा कोई भी विज ् ञापन जारी नहीं been .
in gujarat , the sardar kevadia thursday &apos;s 182 meter high &apos; statue of unity &apos; keeping the foundation stone statue modi said , &quot; earlier , patel had no ads to mark the anniversaries .
while the exhibition upa &apos;s records show that in 2009-10 , to 30 million in 2010-11 to rs 4.10 crore in 2011-12 and rs 2.7 crore in 2012-13 to rs 1.4 crore spent on advertisements of sardar patel .
when the union information and broadcasting minister manish tewari said when asked about modi &apos;s claims that the bjp &apos;s pm candidate facts do not matter .
upa in 2008 did not bring any ads patel .
tiwari said about it was that year because of the economic downturn .
although the amounts spent on advertising each year of sardar patel , nehru - gandhi family members and anniversaries are far below the amount to be spent on punytithiyon .

manish tiwari assumes when asked about the difference , he said , &quot; it should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising .
because the price of advertising depends on several things , including advertising , such as size or rate for that year may include advertising .
असली बात यह है कि इससे हमारे समर ् पण का पता चलता है , जिसका विरोध करने वाले लोग बिना इसके बारे में जाने ही एक महान नेता की विरासत को संभालने की कोशिश में लगे है ।
