the black box in your car ?
while the road body of the united states , the saga highways are battling with the shortage of funds for improving the system , many people are looking for a solution in a small black box , which is fitted with safi dashboard on your car .
the device , which is the automobile drivers on the track for each mile run by the vehicle and that information to transmit to the authorities , have been the main streets of the united states to finance nutrition old washington and state planning for the restoration of the system has become a controversial issue in the effort to the office .
usually highway planning as boring work has become a topic of intense debate and lively alliances .
you have drive miles , and possibly by the drive to keep details of the location and then use this information to prepare for the tax bill to allow the government to use in black box liberatrian to secure support in the party are concerned with environmental groups .
the tea party bhauchkki .
the american civil liberty union also raise privacy issues of various kinds were very worried .
while congress could not agree on this point is that further action or not , cannot wait for a lot of the state .
they are doing this discovery that in the next decade , how they can be used in such a system , in which the driver on a street fixed payment for each mile .
thousands of motor drivers for the test drive is already took the black box , which in some of the gp s. monitoring .
it is essential commodities in fact for our country .
&quot; it is not a matter of the election or not chosen by us , &quot; says it is executive director of the association of southern california , the government of hassan ikhrata fixed by the automobile drivers in the penis &#124; , by the year 2025 , california is planning to begin every mile of the track .
our by tax payment is going to be a change in the way of regulation .
the technology to do so .
this is the main reason is that the highway trust of states &#124; fund has been about bankruptcy , quo &#124; bar finance - up from the payment of taxes collected by the american citizens at the gas pump .
the american people didn &apos;t buy the gas in the past .
now more than 100 miles before a gallons of gas in the car is moving .
no battery occurred in the last 20 years in federal tax , which amounted to 4 cents per 18 .
due to the high price of gas , do not let the money from an increase in a tax .
university of minnesota in transport policy expert lee munich says , &quot; the gas tax is not just snwhniy . &quot;
the state has to pay per mile to test the system for tracking device in 500 cars speculation in recent years .
he says , &quot; the longer it will work in the form of the most reasonable option . &quot;
bonks miles based user fees , it says .
it is not surprising that this idea has been good people to urban liberals , a change in the way to the car , for example , because it has to be a change in taxation , can help reduce the toast and reduce greenhouse gas .
the body of the california mahatvakankshi of the state while they are eager for the system to complete the target set in the global warming legislation will develop doing .
but the state transport committee chairman , bill custer ( a. - a p ) rip vyvhary as the black box as a long-term option .
in the region foundation independent sellers are also in favour of the pay per mile by the driver .
in region deputy speaker of the policy , which adian moore said , &quot; it is not just do it in a blind well being . &quot;
people who are trying to get something , he paid for a more direct way .
the campaign is supported by two former american transport secretaries , who in the year 2011 in its report to congress by the grace of proceeding in the direction of the pay per mile .
the senate had passed the test project of 90 million dollars last year , including 10,000 cars are in vogue .
but work on the concerns of rural law makers , a representative of the people who were doing that day to go to work or go in the city has a long way to go the extra mile , under the leadership of the house , made the proposal at the end .
yet many are moving forward in the direction of the state and the city itself on its own .
it is the most willing oregon , which are listed 5,000 drivers in the use of the country .
the driver as soon as the state gas tax instead of miles will pay the fee .
nevada has already completed a preliminary test .
new york city is moving even further in this direction .
illinois azmaish with trucks on a limited basis .
and the 95 alliance , which along the eastern seaboard of the transport department ( maryland in 17 states , including virginia and florida , pencilveniya ) are included , are studying the idea that they can implementation of the kind of this change .
it did not support the idea of all places .
in nevada , where some time ago 50 voluntary this thing was planted the device on the car , the driver of the car drivers were too impatient with the idea that the government could monitor every step .
nevada , who directed the management of strategic and business performance in the transport department , alauddin khan says &quot; big brother and worry about other things of the same type was a major problem . &quot;
it is not a thing that people wanted .
the trial to proceed at the same time , the nevada a. c. l. the uk was given a warning on its website : &quot; in the tracking device is the device will convert it to a great extent . &quot;
size &#124; large , aprbandhniy is no need of technology to develop the structure structure , which came a day for each person to hold the record for an worldwide mortal .
nevada is from those in many states , which is trying post-exchange for sustainable technology , with help from the state can obtain details of the fact that the car where and how many miles per day is underway , but it is not that he is running at the same time .
khan said that if you can do it , so people can feel more comfortable .
the three miles in search of technology , some state agencies , a small california near start up spread .
the firm was not in the business of the state to help of drivers from the original form .
it was attempting to enter the market growing auto insurance , in which drivers had to be paid on the basis of his miles .
but it is doing the testing of the device , he liked to highway yojanas , because it does not use the gp bommai and provides a very limited information , which of course is uploaded by modem at the time interval .
the main true miles adhishasi rayon morrison said , &quot; if you don &apos;t track the movement of people and their location , they will be more willing to adopt this way . &quot;
the united states has made some big mistakes in these early programs .
it is also a way to economic and low interference to the very low .
in oregon , the body drivers are using different options .
they gp s. r. bommai gp with or without the device can choose .
or they can choose to refrain from any device , but also to be decided by the residents of the state can choose to pay fixed on the basis of the average miles .
at other places in the hope that the device can now make it instead of the concerned citizens by providing more facilities .
in new york city , transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device , which will also feature of parking meters to the payment of the fee , &quot; according to his drive for &quot; will provide insurance , and create a collection of the speed of the real time data from other drivers will use the automobile drivers will be able to avoid the traffic .
city planning has been mentioned in the document , &quot; the automobile drivers to get it because of the benefits it will attract the participation . &quot;
however , some transport yojanas the discussion on the surprise is that it pay per mile big distractions .
in the bay area of san francisco metropolitan transport commission said that the congress is an increase in the gas tax and bankruptcy can tackle the problem of the highway trust fund very easily .
the hybrid or other cars can be construed as an addition of time or annual fee on drivers , whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they can pay their fair share .
the commission rentshelr randi , director of legislation and public affairs , said , &quot; when aspirin may work to do what needs amulchul surgery for her . &quot;
the driver of the car , if we do their privacy and other concerned for a lot of things .

frontier airlines carey - on the duty of baggage lgaenge
in frontier airlines passengers on board his plane to store goods for carey on 100 charge to the plan .
in frontier airlines on a carey - and this is 100 for the plan to start charging for the bags of coffee or soda lgaenge for a fee of 2 , even though its announcement on wednesday said that passengers can put the whole box .
the new carey on duty in the overhead bin bags for is , therefore , a small bag under the seat will still be free one &#124; .
frontier said that 25 charge if it is paid with home improvements or made-to-measure goods , 100 waiting to be paid if passengers to wait until they are at the gate .
frontier spokesman kate o &apos; uglier said that to achieve 100 fees for passengers to take care of the charge with home improvements or made-to-measure goods .
&quot; we don &apos;t want the charge , &quot; he said .
the first and second in 2008 by the airlines started charging for checked bags .
those who are trying to avoid the passenger duty bharai are doing as much as they can in baggage on carey - which is overhead stays in boxes , it means there is often little space in the box .
it is a way to pay less for passengers on board .
o &apos; uglier said that it is not in fact about the new charge of funds .
for the most loyal customers about the frontier is that it has become increasingly difficult to find a place of overhead bin .
airlines passengers to buy tickets on his website has to do it .
it means that the reason is that the next person in line for the same bag may give 100 dollars , while a passenger in a line at the gate frontier , you can get a free bag .
o &apos; uglier said frontier &apos;s website and a-m &#124; czech before they get the gate is being converted for the procedures to ensure travelers know about the fee .
the new frontier carey - on fees , will not begin until the summer , although a date has not been fixed .
travelers are often reveals discontent about baggage fees and other charges , but airline they prefer .
they argue that there is spending money for managing baggage , and those who want a passenger service should pay for it .
many on wall street in fees as a gesture of baggage see that after many years of deficit ones are charged with enough money to cover the cost of air travel .
carey - although the majority don &apos;t even touched on the bag fee .
the duty on carey - spirit airlines inc. started for the first time in the past three years , and allegiant air , a fellow discount later .
the other ones with such a fee hungary &apos;s wizz air , which ones consultant j. sorenson said , and the aid are on track fees .
he said that the spirit carey - on pay 50 million a year in which brings in december 2011 , the report estimated .
sorenson , a former officer in the spirit in recent years of midwest airlines flight with more passengers at the gate carey - on the unusual bag fees has had to face with the surprise .
&quot; was at the boarding process that i had seen in his career ones , &quot; he said .
i hoped to see pisna teeth and a fight outside the gate .
&quot; of the aircraft was and he said that it lickety split ca . &quot;
frontier for coffee , tea , soda , or jaws spirit &apos; is doing a fee of 2 .
frontier nakhi that passengers will take zoos soda , or they can put the whole box , and give it a free coffee for the only time .
it will also give away from the water .
us airways briefly tried to charge for drinks products in 2008 , but seven months later after complaining of passengers after they moved back and is there any other major ones follow one &#124; .
if the crew of frontier &apos; s airlines from carey - don &apos;t buy directly on his own website on the steps of frontier to charge fees for customers to run to his latest effort .
airlines like the orbitz online travel sellers have to pay for the tickets have sold out of every 10 to 25 .
the reason is that many airlines buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency has been given an incentive to run for the passengers .
although frontier , went ahead in this area .
to provide frequent flight in september at a distance of a mile from the other half for those customers who had bought from an online travel agency with these people
on wednesday , it reduced dive trips to 25 percent of the miles miles award .
so one bought from an online travel agency , 1,000 miles frontier dive trips will acquire a distance of 250 miles .
it is also frontier to buy directly from the website that they only allows passengers to choose their seat in advance .
frontier is a loyal base of customers in the city of his home in the denver , but its business is being lessened , and it is losing money .
a 9 percent decline in revenue and its flight capacity has been reduced by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter , according to financial results released on wednesday by the corporate parent of republic airways holdings inc .
as part of the sale of the republic airlines are trying to decide frontier of finance .

on the subject of scientists and light in the act of the tail of the dog that he and his mood is whether relations between the two countries .
it is learned from previous research that happy dogs are more hillate on the right on his tail ( from the point of view of a dog ) , while its tail on the left side of the main form of restless dogs are more hillate .
but now the scientists say that the companion dog can identify the subtle distinction of the tail and can express their reaction to it .
the study was published in the journal current biology .
university of georgia professor from taranto neuroscientist wellrtigra said : &quot; this &#124; * .xml &#124; all in humans are well aware that excitement that the left and the right part of the brain that are involved in a different way to generate positive or negative feelings . &quot;
here we have attempted to do it in other species .
he said that , like humans , dogs in the right part of the brain responsible for the act of his left hand and the opposite order was , and two different roles in the golardhon feelings abbasi &#124; .
by the dog and other dogs to learn more about this unilateral move the tail on how to respond , see the films of the other dogs tracked to animals .
he dhadkan at the heart of pet dogs to measure and analyze their behavior .
we understand that their tail may take more time because one side never , ever , on the other hand shaking .
prof. wellrtigra said : &quot; we have introduced with films of dog breeds of dogs to deal with other issues in a realistic version or to the confusion in the shadow picture , and we could see the tail unfriendly and the tail could offer more left or right . &quot;
when the animals from the point of view of a dog , a stolid dog on the right side of his tail ) hillate seen so they &apos;re completely from the rest .
but when he changed the direction of the tail mainly on the left side of his heart looked like ( restart from the point of view of a dog ) dhadkan respectively.during and they look puzzled .
according to prof. wellrtigra dogs through the act did not think they were deliberately trying to communicate with each other .
instead , they think that the dog had learned from this experience is that they do not acted on and on what should be worried .
he said : &quot; if you have met several times with other dogs , and if they are hillate on one side of the tail , so it is more concerned with the dostana behavior , and at the right part presents dostana behavior , you react on the basis of the same experience . &quot;
, the owners say that these conclusions , animal trainers and doctors can provide better information about the feelings of the animals .
university of bristol &apos;s school of vetrneri sciences fellow the guest of dog behavior expert john bradshaw has said that it is not the first study to investigate whether left or right for dogs is an important part or not .
last year university of lincoln &apos;s team found that when dogs are if you see an aggressive dog on the left side of his head and happy to see the dog at the right side of his head .
in the other research at the university of victoria in canada , said : &quot; contrary to the italian study - when the robot was hilly on the left side to the right of the tail of the dog , and the dog was more likely to the close instead of being puzzled . &quot;
he said that this was because the difference because the dog films in various studies in animals or robot dogs do not understand the full dog .
he made clear that the real dogs by the dog &apos;s reaction to the study of the ways you can help .
&quot; while different mammals are found enough evidence of the fact that the two parts of the brain is used for different purposes , to get a more detailed information is still the rest - and , in this case , dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
however , that can be easily enter their behavior , considering it seems that we will never understand that their tail may take more time on one side , why is moving on the other side .

on the directions of the office ( bfv ) for the defense of the constitution , germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , the mission was taking a picture of the roof of the post of the united states , which is located at a distance of less than 5 km from the european central bank and bundisbnk .

but since edward snowden , a contractor who is whistleblower , a treasure trove of his rahasya started to the u.s. surveillance , in the world of european sarkarke and business leaders are no longer sure to follow his promise that the director of nice .
as the u.s. national security agency , the oil company of brazil , and the detective on petrobras of our cloud providers , including google and yahoo , and yahoo has expressed fear about kiarajy surveillance .
the last thing occurred when it was learned that a bug in the phone of chancellor angela merkel , perhaps a decade ago .
if europe can be targeted to the most powerful person , so of course in the world of business leaders are also potential targets .

by jim sahba , sap &apos;s chief executive officer says : &quot; we have seen a new question that customers came a year ago , said she is my data stored ? and what you can guarantee that it physically the right to remain in the region ? &quot;
many &apos;s argument is that the latest report of the german authorities are trying to confirm what they already knew : that the powerful state want to steal their most precious secrets and data and this should be phra at every price for them .

prepaid mobile phone threw again later .
however , small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring , it is a matter of concern .
in germany , it is the best in the global market for many companies in a special place .
&quot; small and medium size companies often lack of experience , requesting more effectively against unauthorized access to financial resources to protect corporate secrets , &quot; bfv warned in a report .

to the disappointment of obama voters clamour
i expect a change in the obama vote twice him &#124;
they say that as a result of the policy of the barrier of g. v. o. p. v. obama became the great effort , interrupted .
the policy of the barrier obamacare cannot give the excuse of the suffering of the website , drone attacks
obama &apos;s memoir of the year 2008 reminds one of those things that you could
nathaniel p morris second year student at harvard medical school .
today , i am very sad to read books .
this is a book about which i think it got the pain during the second year of medical school , i will and i expect kiran jgaayegi .
the name &quot; the courage of the win , &quot; and this year of the 2008 presidential campaign of barack obama sansmrika .
when i of his patients as the night before they could foresta goes to bed and i &apos;m so this book is to take me in a certain period , which was inspired by politics of millions your breathing and speech were able to the travelers .
the election will be ektrf and news took a pause for showing the historical significance of the speakers at the time .
the joy in the eyes of my chaiya were tears , and my parents had put every tastes can save the newspaper .
a group of young telescope was going to the white house , and the whole country was ready for a change .
in the year 2008 obama during the president had an approval rating of 82 percent .
and then i closed his book .
the reality of the present is a hard truth , for example , to return to the world of dreams .
the hope is hard to remember those days seem a distant memory , they are a tragic reminder of lost opportunities .
i was really change after proposing by voting for the first time .
simple as , say , it couldn &apos;t have any idea .
i give credit to a lot of achievements , affordable obama care act to the withdrawal of our troops from iraq , &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell &quot; until the end to the killing of osama bin laden .
in addition , i believe it is unfair to protest the policy has prevented a lot of proceeding with the efforts of our country is in immigrant reform , health care , in addition to the public option , to airport closed on guantánamo bay , and others are included .
but asanga times where i take the side of the obama administration before you of your colleagues and friends - they may have the answer for me that i can give them .
i reached the point of political despair .
the foreign policy of the republican opposition leaders of intelligence is not the answer , not just north of drona attacks on innocent children in foreign countries .
about the private lives of ordinary american citizens by the national security agency , it may not be the answer to store the data is not only wrong act of the government of light can give an answer to the people of prosecution .
it without a trial of an american citizen , anwar el cannot tell the reason for the killing of war , not only as the president of public funds during a luncheon and expenditure limits .
it cannot be north of the conclusions of the report , which is to say that the effort by the white house of the media silent &quot; nixon are the most aggressive since the administration . &quot;
and most of it in recent years , the affordable care act , signed into law after three years as a simple design of the website cannot give the excuse for failure .
i don &apos;t know whether i was expected of it .
if , at the age of 18 , i guess it must was that the government system , it can bring the revocation of a political campaign .
that is directly elected office a predictably , there is no way , because the opposition political parties and random events such as the nyutawn massacre , we will provide the size of the public discussion .
however , i have given up as an example , they are often be chosen by the administration of itself .
it is most worried about you .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not so that i recognise from his opponent .
and one has to be a part romney presented an option , which it did not appear to determine his policies or his office .
i felt that a second term for obama , who will be free from the pressure of elections in the future , they will complete the hopes about which we are hearing from a long time .
however , while obama is less than 45 percent of the anumeadn rating this week , going through the book of the year in 2008 , it has become very difficult .
i see it disappeared into the memory of suits .
in this week had been read an excerpt of the book , which was described as a result of that kind of obama in the primary pencilveniya clinton nhua the huge loss .
annemarie schimmel , a post , in the meeting , he said to his subordinate employees that they need to get back on track , and on his motives remain stynish needs .
he said , &quot; i want to get its mojo back . &quot;
we must remember who we are . &quot;
today , five years after mr president , you and i couldn &apos;t agree more .
the views expressed in comments are the nathaniel mores .

the dispute has focused on the width of the seat of the economy class in the long udaan vimana , as always , do not like to be given by airlines latest jet with the efficiency of allocating space arabs sas and boing company claims to be the key .
arabs economy this week to give a detailed seat of at least 18 inches in cabin ( 46 cm ) is expected to the industry standard , but it should be decided by airlines of his main rival boeing says .
the dispute comes in the middle of the aircraft manufacturers as possible after the incident of 17 and 21 were recorded in order of the long distance from aircraft twin engines of the big version rush of sale .
the aircraft is designed to the previous department - specifically whether sitting 9 or 10 equals more capable of keeping in mind the davos mini is being prepared for the design of the jets jumbo ?
boeing of the 406 people say that it is &quot; 777 size &#124; x &quot; created 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department added .
airbus says the 350 rush while at the same time , it will take a seat left to 9 to 18 inches in 350 people .
the veteran has often do business strike on technical matters through an advertisement in the trade press .
now , with airbus , 777 size &#124; x ratio in dubai is expected to be dominated by more than 100 order , a further appeal to the public .
in recent years , it has been seen as the beginning of the war of vigiapan finnsero they may also have something to do with it in a restaurant with a traces of three villagers &#124; it to accept you ?
airbus sales chief john alehi , &quot; boeing regional turbo from long distance in snkrisiton is working on the flight , &quot; he said .
the people in the form of a change may be getting bigger , but the way to the floor of the aircraft has not changed .
according to the statistics of the us health department for a long time between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 ne jumbo ki , the trip has been defined , and ke ant at an average of 40 to 49 years of the century , the american male weight at 10 percent increase .
the u.s. health in the 21st century , according to the statistics , the average american man &apos;s waist 39 . 7 inches .

airbus &apos;s say they have established research commission , which is the seat of an extra inch in width 53 per cent to the suggestion of improvement in the quality of sleep .
boeing , airbus one &#124; ankara of measurement for a seat on the dispute , and said that it is not dependent on the decision of the manufacturers of how to make a balance between airlines fares and suvidha .
it also says , from the research shows more than the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin .
boeing cabin craver expert kent said that &quot; it is able to provide the airlines in reality shows tactical flexibility and jinheviswas on those things that they need to do to be successful as it is . &quot;
&quot; he is an advantage for us what they do not want it . &quot;
he is a better idea of their business in comparison with someone else .
it is about the elbow room for fliers , but for the supplier rapidly , it is an issue that can affect the income .
behind the dispute is a way of at least 700 billion dollars of business for american and european exports to tip the balance in the event of aircraft order in the coming decades , there is enough .
the writer riportne told for the first time in july , the seat layout is really ladaika issue between the new jet aircraft .

kevin kenyan , europe &apos;s airbus passenger says the head of the facility of the boeing to make it more competitive with their aircraft , our products , and is trying to put more seats on the vine . &quot;
on the other hand , analysts say the 10 seats per row cabin for the current 777 s suggestion is that many passengers are in favour of the denser layout , which can be along with cheap fares .
runway girl of my krabi , founder and editor of the cabin , an expert said the network &quot; seat width of 18 inches for passengers to be very great , but the reality is that airbus business point of this proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 . &quot;
airbus and boeing supplier for the supply of seats , but airlines do not provide a list to choose from doing .
jet sellers from around the world to check on this layouts competition to carefully examine measures .
more &#124; * .xml &#124; all builders while the rest of the jet aircraft with a low cost airline and giving layouts with a high density for a regional tour .

by the time the first youth : soon to be bigger
research shows that african american and hispanics girls in comparison of white girls of her age at the age can get the youth .
physical change does not mean that youth is near
there is no evidence of the fact that the hormone or any other chemical blamed can
experts believe that obesity outbreak in the age of puberty may be one reason
by the time is not as effective in the case of the first youth boys
a former reporter of the c. n. n. pat etherij expert journalist in the health of children and family issues .
whether the mother should be worried , if at the age of 7 or 8 years in her daughter started to the development of the breasts and genital hair go ?
this week at the annual conference of the academy of american hair care in orlando , florida &apos;s medical endocrainologist caplovitz dr. paul has made clear that the initial physical change is common in american girls , reflecting the new practice .
caplovitz says , &quot; i &apos;m very little time spent in the parents to believe it shows that it usually doesn &apos;t complete the rapid progress in the direction of the nation . &quot;
the development will be visible symptoms such as the breasts ankurit genital and kanak smell girls in the hair and physically see before that time .
but in the past four decades has been very little change in the age of rjodarshan ( religion in the first month ) .
united 12 per cent of the united states , the average age was 75 per year , 12 of the year in 1970 .
&quot; when start to develop breasts are , at least in the first rjodarshan takes two to three years . &quot; caplovitz points out that &quot; time before puberty in girls : the essential guide to deal with this common problem . &quot; is also the author
the development of the nation is the most accurate test of time .
what is the beginning of the youth , is a debate about this , but when it is two with the growth of breast development before the age of 8 &quot; pros , hair , &quot; says .
in most cases , the process will be slow or stop quo &#124; bar hair can be examined by a physician , next to where i lived there .
in the case of a more rapid progress in the investigation by andocrainologist may need to tumors or cyst as the prospects of serious problems can be overcome .
if the results from the previous month , religion and other treatments to increase are : the time before the age of the bones , which can be nata in the form of undeveloped growth and adult height .
sanstutiyan , the age of the child , for the treatment of drug or hormone depends on the growth rate , the growth rate , and the emotional vyskta .
the psychological aspect is also important .
caplovithj are conscious about the drug , but accept , &quot; the youth may increase vyvaharatmk pressing issue , and girls can feel different from his colleagues . &quot;
on the other hand , can be considered a big problem : email just don &apos;t want that to be the daughter of his age , the monthly religion .
caplovithj said , &quot; they do worry about the risk of pregnancy , or how they will maintain the cleanliness . &quot;
a woman , whose daughter mira of up to 10 years in hinduism was started on a monthly basis , but they do , &quot; was the shock . &quot;
although there were signs of this month - and we could also talk about religion , but he was not emotionally ready .
he was dry from his school and worried about the party in her first menstrual cycle began .
there are a lot of suprchlit theory about the causes of premature puberty .
however , the fact that there is no evidence of any problems in milk and other food products could be accused hormone , chemicals in the environment or yaunonmukhi messages in the media .
boys as well as girls are trying to get the same time - a former youth .
caplovithj this rule is determined that it is the main cause of obesity outbreak .
in the year 2001 , he had helped to run from 6 to 9 years of study at the top of the girls , who at the time of the youth of body fat with associates .
other results do not support this conclusion , but there are also a number of other factors that contribute to it .
in this country , african american and hispanics the tendency to get white girls before puberty in girls of their age .
there are many explanations for this .
at the global level , with a replica of the former youth at the same time , economic conditions are likely to be affected by the weather and jeans , all things .
another puzzle : although boys are getting in the face and at the age of genital hair , but full of a function of puberty , girls are not as clear .
a. a. p. ; on the other doctors attending the conference in support of the jtiltaoen one &#124; .
even that was common in babies and children can also be seen muhanse and genital hair .
in morristown nujrsi goryeb childrens andocrainologist hair , a physician at the hospital , dr. lawrence silverman says , &quot; we need to be careful about this is that we do not identify with the kind of the real start of the youth . &quot;
the parents to take the opinion in this regard should not hesitate in taking guidance from their hair to how to talk to their children .
the caplovitz advised , &quot; can be a means to the talks before the expected time . &quot;
if you stay calm , your child will normally answered correctly .
at the same time prior to the development of the girls in this daily to require that even before this time is happening , but it is a part of normal life .

b. b. c. after years of a intrsecs , the person said , &quot; no , i &apos;m a man , not a woman . &quot;
i was built by the doctors make scheme , stained paban m .
according to the estimate of 2,000 children in each year is like a child who is neither boy or girl .

may wallis simpson intrsecs .
the gender identity is still not properly understood , but united of the united states , most experts believe that when sex determination not to specify the sex is better to use the best information available to the public and to surgery , if it came to it , before an inspection of the psychological and physical development of children .
the city of new york psychiatrist dr. jack dresser who are expert in matters of gender identity , he said that the new law of germany &quot; would be a good thing . &quot;
intrsecs children moral quandary produce .
he said , &quot; some people are in position as a life crisis for which require surgery , but the vast majority of children with this is not the case . &quot;
you can specify sex without surgery , and after her view that identify how to develop .
how to develop a sex in a child , knowing the science is not very accurate .
in this regard , any person cannot give the right answer why magic &#124; .
it is a kind of a puzzle why gay people are .
in the year 2011 or transgender transsexual intrsecs people in the report filed before the european commission has been described as different from the people , because their case is not related to sex , but it is related to biological structure , which is clearly neither male nor female but is as either side of the united nations or any of them are not clearly defined .

the adult male , female or on their official documents to the people of australia and nepal has already given permission to mark &quot; third gender &quot; .
in june , the 52 year-old australian in nore velby , &quot; unspecified &quot; during his life after winning a legal appeal to keep the status became the first person recognised &quot; linghin &quot; of the world .
in a german passport , according to the interior ministry of m or f , third in the form of a protest for intrsecs people will also be nirdishtikrn .
according to a news report on france 24 in the neighboring country , france is still controversial issues related to sex .
in the year 2011 , the strict law makers from the books of the school as dozens of catholic country of a-m &#124; french &quot; gender theory &quot; signed a petition for the agitation .
the website is opposed by the catholic online also say the law of germany , &quot; while the world is being in such a situation , where sex is the option chosen by itself , but not on the sexual activity , and two of the civilization &#124; pillars &#124; we are going to move in the opposite direction . &quot;
the baby from the mother of a newborn baby in maryland said that children will like to be referred to the time of birth .
he bringing about on the website said , &quot; parvarish without additional limits is very stressful , especially if you don &apos;t know what your child &apos;s gender . &quot;
children need to the stability and .
historically , both male and female genital birth to children with hermaphrodites ( hermaphrodite ) said was , which was named after a greek god who was bisexual .
and too little time by nearly a decade ago , the medical world was considered as a slate of the penis , which can be deleted and then wrote .
but now , many people are giving moral challenge of surgery , gender identity that they &apos;re understand it is a complicated job , and sometimes even from the doctors can be a mistake , which it did not know that the children were growing up on his penis will feel about nirdishtikrn .
dresser says &quot; in the middle of the 20th century , it was called &quot; psychiatry emergency &quot; .
when the children were born , you were not only to the psychiatrist , you were called to doctors and surgeons .
the current theories about the treatment of children with their genital was presented by dr. john money of john hopkins university , which is believed to sunirmanniy .
he of the composition of the word &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that the social and environmental cues - parents how to bring up a child - that he is determined by a child interaction with the genes and hormones in the form of a man identified as a man or woman .
but in a case of the year 1966 , which is known as the &quot; john / joanne &quot; advisor &#124; , he became a controversial theory .
he was a child , whose gender was eventually sex during the lingagrchrm uchhedn ( circumcision ) bandhe advised the parents that they are full of children by his testicle refusing to and brought it up like a girl .
dresser said , &quot; money has presented the case as a successful case of avsthantr , but he did not do so . &quot;
at the age of 15 years , the child back his marriage with you changed in the form of a man and a woman .
but at the age of 38 , he took his own life .
dresser said that some doctors are still trying to &quot; follow the same image .
but with the advent of the internet in later years of the year 1990 , started the sex come before the people passing through surgery &quot; was not happy with the results . &quot;
such was the case with the author , 36 , of montana of jim bruce , who was born with x chromosome y men , but it was unclear and genital .
the doctors did not know clearly that his penis was too small , or that he was bhgshef , but he was sure he could never was not &quot; happy life &quot; in the form of a man .
in 1976 , the year of his birth , only after some time , the outer part of the bruce and testicle given out by surgery and he was bringing the kind of girl .
he hormone woman at the age of 12 .
he told abcnews at the , &quot; i knew that i &apos;m not a girl . &quot;
i was not happy , but it was very difficult to the question .
at the age of 18 , with her vaijainoplasti was ending .
but avsadgrst and feel some errors , she sought medical records .
he learned of the terrible truth .
at the time of birth , i was bandhe - and some have never told me .
bruce , who took birth with d. s. r. d. in sufficient quantities to her body testosterone prevented from the building , which caused her genital could not be developed in a proper way .
after the truth , he became back to the man , he testosterone dose of lee and his breast htva .
as a result of surgery , he was ban .
today , he interface people about intrsecs people in the organization of a project to create a common perception explains .
however , the legal group based california advocates adhishasi , director of the choice for informed annie timer mantis has expressed concern that germany &apos;s law &quot; invites tippi and an adarsh beta . &quot;
he says , &quot; a lot of activist people think that a quick decision on the law of germany , parents and children to &quot; anirdharit &quot; referred to by will . &quot;
we fear that it will encourage the intervention .
we think that instead of waiting , specify the male or female sex is a process .
but we don &apos;t know how the law nibhaega his role , so we can only guess .
timer metis said that his organization has the support of the australian law , therefore , because &quot; it allows adults to be identified in the third gender . &quot;
he said , &quot; about the legal sex adults should be able to take their own decision . &quot;
germany &apos;s law , it is related to the time of birth .
this is not a war to thread through the newborn children at this time .
big on it , a decision related to his body , he can get himself .
but is the daughter of dr. airline baratang sexual development of breast radiology ugliness &#124; of pittsburgh , and hundreds of other people in the support group does help , said that germany will provide both parents and children to &quot; the power of the law . &quot;
the daughter of bharatji katy was born with male chromosomes , but it is androgens asnvednshilta syndrome , d. s. r. d ..
since then androgens in graha defect was , therefore , katy developed in the female characters .
it is so organ in the body , but the womb or dinbgrnthi .
now 29 , katy married and pencilveniya resident in the psychology department at the university of hair .
although he is ban , but he does expect a mother through adoption or gesteshnl srogesi .
bharats said , &quot; the law allows parents to the fact that they were in their you do not take any decision . &quot;
it before writing them , &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female &apos; by some test provides to the right way and at the same time .
in this way , you live for the right to bring up a child from baby love .
you have a lovely child , and it will take so powerful .
we were in there is no need to do surgery which cannot be returned .
he said , &quot; it brings the children in the decision-making process and the motive for the parents anxiety disorder is free from it because they don &apos;t believe that they are doing the right thing . &quot;
at the end of the day , the child will determine what he is more comfortable with sex -- and it will be a very good thing .
this enables the children in their decision for themselves .

palmer united party can be controlled by four votes in the senate , which to set about reducing the carbon and mining taxes can be significant .
but mr palmer claimed that only ministers may be a conflict of interest , and said that the daughters of mr about can benefit personally from policies .
mr palmer said , &quot; provided a vital interest in the case of a family holiday can be a struggle , as if they have a daughter is pregnant , they will have a direct interest holiday that they met or not met . &quot;

george caravan euros scots the dissolution of the option him &#124;
another day , another story of the fear of independence
this time we warn that the whole of the uk as a condition of membership in the form of the independent travel sector in europe will join the need for an independent scotland .
on the walls of the passport control and hardin on brvik indicate a string of stories about the extent of the fences .
the truth is that the strathclyde papers described about potential economic benefits of free travel with the rest of europe , though purvanumanit did not describe it in the form of headlines .
nobody has described as a member of the uk spend most of their time in the formal rules to change their reservations .
since it is no longer the public sector in scotland schengen brussels from scotland , in fact , who also wants to get it cheap concessions in return for a sustained non compliance brussels .
therefore , however , a different story .
and the fact that so long as it is limping from the time i was first . &quot; passport control , is the meaning of freedom , &quot; bebuniyad had heard the news about 40 years ago .
yet it was lost in an interesting point to an interesting story again .
why is also expected to bidding of europe from an independent scotland should ?
why yoke brussels for london to purchase and sale , especially now ?
the real european news : organized to europe to the great , the plan after the war was stopped at the end of the day .
bureau of the crisis at the same time , the european project has been officially dead .
the uk . in uk euros to the opposition or in the form of a common currency for closing a dedicated team are trying to gain strength .
yuroskeptil alternative even in germany , the party for germany , which was founded this year -- suddenly came in federal elections in september , nearly 50 million votes were received , and thus to free democrats ( our own libaas the equivalent of dams ) to effectively out of bundesstag one &#124; .
the plan has always been domestic opposition to the construction of a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis proved a radical parivrtncark .
the strict rules imposed by the european central bank of berlin and at the same time , through the practice of common currency speculation on national economies were because of the barriers to think a lot of people have been project that europe has gone too far .
national bureau of excessive budget deficit in the government very much part of the crisis was not only in the case of greece , it was the truth .
but the stipend system , its members in favour of german exporters , the currency exchange rate stable - a thing that want to keep the german politician .
the domestic currency without the possibility of avmulyn , south europe finds himself in a position on the underlying loss of productivity in comparison of germany .
it is the only way to reduce public expenditure and salaries - which have been encouraged by berlin .
on the currency and budget problems than on a european rugnta productivity .
a-m &#124; french at the expense of consumers and a-m &#124; german energy firms to offer discounts to brussels by speculation was as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy policies in comparison of the united nations , the european industry , gas and electricity for double pay for four times .
the cost to the disabled by the loss , which we have already seen in grangemauth .
fries &#124; * .xml &#124; all wage should also be given to the european petrochemicals industry in the world cannot save the cheap coahuila from being affected by the gas shell .
as a result , people have been chopped in the spirit of rebellion , especially in france , which had been the main fans never uk .
after yudh to handle the top politicians of france , the uk , germany , and paris in the world of washington was seen as a way to provide equal billing .
but the berlin is no longer need for political legitimacy in paris in the form of a passport , and it of europe on its own economic policies are implemented , for which the economy of france has been the innocents .
the result : right wing , e. uk opposition national front of marine le penn has in recent upchunav ruling socialist dhkelte on the third place with the victory .
in france at the time front for the british labour is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote in due course as it is a warning that they cannot walk that disruption to the left , right to the automatic gain heaga .
lee payne a-m &#124; french between whites , working class in his new found fame with what he is doing ?
the party for the next year to the uk . use elections to the european parliament in uk rival , intersection currency wants to create a rival group .
if , as is quite possible , these elections in uk rival parties do a good performance , the group of this kind can influence the european parliament for the first time .
in my view is this : e. uk soon in europe and intersection will end emotions &#124; euros at the confluence of the currency .
bureau is not completely over , but the bric-a-brac &quot; ( arena ) nations of europe &quot; will reach back in a way that will have the support of general de gaulle .
germany and some of it was arthvyavsthaan can maintain the stipend , but with france and southern europe and will start again .
i expect that the uk in the hope of improving njdikian with u.s. it will distance themselves from this project .
however , a sign of the increasing interest in washington pacific seen &#124; is that the united kingdom will be left in the cold atlantic .
after all these of scotland ?
we can choose to make the area of little england ( necessary way ) .
or we can protect their own economic interests in berlin and brussels at the right time for a different reason to join .
i think scotland loose in the european system can improve business performance , provided that we keep its own currency .
non european union countries in other countries with similar thinking it will be easy to work with miljulkr .
otherwise we &apos;re walking on the path of norway should think about maintaining its economic freedom .
s. c. n. p. v. in scotland in europe from the government as ullekhnniy most successful parsimony - who has been hostile political campaign to oppose the cuts proposed by the chancellor alastair darling ( and implementation ) of labour and tory - after her libaas dam on the basis of the coalition had won a surprising majority in the year 2011 .
the time for scotland to vote for independence will be talking nonsense , because in that case , it imposed by brussels and berlin to the parsimony have to accept the rules .

the high class of europe is ready to do business with the united kingdom ?

this conclusion , who visited in a multitude of a prominent businessman , has shown that businessmen are inspired towards a &quot; significant changes &quot; that the u.k. to give back to the lost power .
it is a very high price treaty change and the issue of how to get a better deal for britain referendum in , 16 percent of the vote in favour of transnational living in the uk .
the prime minister must not be in any doubt that this survey is dasharatha businessman of the united kingdom , the talks on the terms of britain &apos;s membership in the uk to support his plan .
it also shows that businessman , to present the balance of power in favour of the u.k. are expected to punwarta to a meaningful change .
