iन ् टraseks kids can choose the sex of their parents &apos; &apos; atarinirdha &apos; children
germany and the european union , which has become the first country to recognize the third gender for children born with ambiguous genital .
now the children iconoclast male or female , to be specified .
according to the new law , parents of children for sex as it gives them the baby &apos; &apos; on the birth certificate atarinirdha &apos; &apos; or the need to `` unspecified &apos; &apos; declared .
the purpose of the new law , those parents of newborn children for sex - nikaranardishty decision related to that pressure can fast forward to fight discrimination against intraseks surgeon operating , and children .
b . b . c . , according to a intraseks years later , i am not a woman , &apos; &apos; said the man , man . &apos; &apos;
i am going to make was made by the doctors , paibanda stained prosaic .
it is estimated that every year in a child who is not the girl that is 2 , 000 children .
intraseks , they are part of a group of about 60 conditions , which comes under the authority of the collective term that abnormal chromosomes , nagrajanthi ( surface developed the disease development or testes ) , or abnormal forms of it .
wallis to may have been intraseks .
gender identity is still not considered properly , but most experts believe that when united states , may not be the best way to use the best available information to assign gender - assessment is the surgeon and the medical , psychological and physical development before , if such it when the child .
new york is the city that cases of sex - he said that a new law expert , dr jack ड ् रेshr &apos; &apos; of germany appears to be a good thing . &apos; &apos;
intraseks children born moral dilemmas .
he said , &apos; &apos; some people - are in a crisis situation , for which require surgery , but most kids with it . &apos; &apos;
you can see that after the surgery without sex , and how to recognize .
no sex in a child will develop the science is not exactly how many .
about any reasonable person can not answer why it should happen .
this is a kind of puzzle is why people are gay .
year in 2011 , the european commission rejected the report intraseks people from different people in traansasealaksu or traansandaraje described as a sex is not related to his work , because his position but neither male nor female but clearly related to biological , either of the two is a clearly defined jointly or both .
these features , the secondary characters , such as muscle weight , hair distribution , breasts and length of sex can display ; primary sexual traits such as reproductive organs and genital ; or chromosomal structure and mohorana .
the report intraseks and traansandaraje people face discrimination and harassment , violence and discrimination in jobs to the crimes of the overview is .
now there are non - with the boys for the special camp .
australia and the adult male , female or `` third gender &apos; &apos; on official documents he has given people permission to mark .

france 24 news report , according to the neighboring country in france , the issue is still controversial .
dozens of catholic country in the year 2011 , a french law - the `` gender theory &apos; &apos; of agitation for school books have signed the petition .
u . s . website catholic online , the law saying that opposition , &apos; &apos; while the world in such a state of germany , where sex selection is not sexual activity , and the two pillars of civilization itself , but in the opposite direction . &apos; &apos;
merindalai newborn baby in the mother joan said that at the time of birth , sex will be referred to the baby .
he said , &apos; &apos; without additional limits on the website up about , especially if you know that your child is very tense up , is not what it is . &apos; &apos;
children with stability and is required .
historically , both male and female sex organs of children haramaifrodaaits ( hermaphrodite ) , who was with the handsome greek god who parthenogenesis .
and almost a decade ago , the medical world has had less time in which can be deleted the slate and then wrote .
but now comes up , a lot of people understand morality of the surgeon to challenge it , sex - and sometimes even complex medical doctors , who may not know that children will be what to do about their sex nikaranardishty big mistake .
ड ् रेshr &apos; &apos; is in the middle of the 20th century , it was called `` the emergency . &apos; &apos;
when the child was born , the psychiatrist , you called the surgeon .
we can obscure the treatment of children in the current theory , presented by dr john money john hainsapaki university who was the sunirmanayani .
he `` gender identity &apos; &apos; and argued that the social and environmental - parents , children , how do the gene and immunity interactions with children up for him as a man or woman identified as .
but in a matter of years , 1966 , &apos; &apos; john joanne &apos; &apos; as they became controversial theory .
he was a child , whose gender lingagracharma - cholecystectomy ( sarkashanamasi parents dies during sex to the advice that he bandhy full of children and took the works and the girl had been brought up .
ड ् रेshr said , `` money , presented the case as a successful case of antaravasthaa but did not do so . &apos; &apos;
15 years of age , a child and a woman from the back you change in marriage .
but , at the age of 38 years , he took his own life .
ड ् रेshr said that some doctors are still trying to follow the same representation . &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
1990 - a year after the advent of the internet , but in the intervening years , these people came through the surgery had started `` not happy &apos; &apos; with the result .
this was the case , 36 , the author of the monatana jim bruce , who was born with male chromosomes x . y . but we had with vague .
doctors did not understand clearly that he was small , it was big , but he was not sure he could bhagashefa sex or any man in the form of life &apos; &apos; satisfied . &apos; &apos;
in 1976 , a year after its birth , the organ and testicle surgery given up like a girl and her out by bruce .
it was women mohorana at the age of 12 years .
abcnews . com , he said , `` i know i am not a girl . &apos; &apos;
i was not happy , but the question was hard .
at the age of 18 years was the vaijaaeenoplasty .
but unhappy and felt something wrong , he asked for medical records .
the terrible reality of it .
i was born bandhy - and never told me .
bruce , d . s . d . , which prevented her body with sufficient due to testosterone with was that we could not be developed .

george kerewah given the option स ् कॉts euro disintegration .
one day , independence and fear of another story .
this time is that we have the conditions of membership of the eu as independent travel throughout europe as the region . . to join the independent scotland .
thorny wire on the walls of the passport control and haiड ् रिyn on baravika give hints about the stories .
the truth is that the rest of europe , with the potential economic benefits of independent travel in the description , although स ् ट ् रैthaklaida papers it - hedalaainsa - want &apos; .
not a description that members of his time to spend less in their formal rules , uk .
now as scotland schengen area , brussels really wants to return the non - compliance for brussels , also from scotland who served there will be free .
so , again , a story .
and the thing is that so long as the first is the meaning of `` freedom &apos; &apos; they passport control , i was so far trapped by it is news was almost 40 years ago .
however , this interesting story was lost to the interesting point again .
also , an independent scotland in the european bidinga than why should it ?
london yoka brussels for the purchase price , especially now - why ?
here is the real european news : europe to the great war plan , after finally stopped .
euro crisis , project europe has officially dead .
. in the uk , to protest against or equal to inflation in the euro to close the party firmly to the uk are getting .
even in germany , yuuroskelaप ् टि aल ् टranetiva for germany - which this year is the party that nearly half a million votes in the september federal election , and the suddenly free heavyweight ( our own equivalent ) to effectively . buन ् डेsaटैga demsa libaas
the construction of a federal europe is always the plan to the domestic opposition .
however , the current economic crisis has proved a radical varipartanakaraka .
pressed by berlin and the european central bank , is to have the same currency is the national economies with strict rules , went through the barriers , because of the very people that project in europe by far .
national governments budget deficit in the euro crisis , not only in the case of greece was very much true .
but the euro system , the german exporters in favor of a currency exchange rate fixed - the thing that german politicians want to keep .
warning domestic currency , southern europe compared to the underlying loss in germany without the possibility of his productivity .
the only solution is to reduce public expenditure and - which has been encouraged by berlin .
on the budget , and the currency has problems ahead of a european schistosomiasis productivity .
french and german energy firms at the expense of consumers to the exemption for green energy policies as a result of the united nations , the european industry , &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; - has been tapped by brussels to double electricity and gas for four times .
it is unable to do that , we had already seen costs in ग ् रैuthamange .
फ ़ ् रीja all pay tax in the world , european peट ् रोkemicals industry of cheap us gas shell by not could save .
as a result , in the spirit of rebellion , especially in france , the uk , the main fans due .
yuuddh , top politicians of france , germany and the uk to the control . vanshitanaga equal billing to the way the world was seen in paris .
berlin , now applied for passports as a political legitimacy , but the need for paris and the european economic policies of humanity is because the economy of france .
parimanah the uk national front of marine lee payne , the recent ruling socialist rival , the right wing . upachunava backward in the third place on the victory .
france 24 per cent of the vote , with the most popular - the british labor party , the front for representatives warning that he did not think that left for separatism , right , for the benefit hae ाga automatically .
lee payne french white , working class in the middle of his new found fame with what ?
it being used in european parliament elections next year , the uk . . u . , rival groups want to make money - intersection .
if , as is possible in these elections , opposition parties are thus a good performance , a uk group for the first time by the european parliament .
my view is that in europe , uk and the intersection of the euro currency - soon . hatred .
euro , will not , but this group of nations like back in a form that will reach europe &apos; &apos; ( `` retail chain ) will support general de gaulle .
germany and the euro , but france and southern europe and some of the arthasthaaevyavan could restart their coins .
i expect that the u . s . janakidiya to distance themselves from this project in the hope of the uk .
however , there were signs that britain is interested in the vanshitanaga territories in the cold atlantic will be skipped .
in most of the scotland bill ?
we can target the area of the little england ( required ) to make .
or we can protect their own economic interests , which include the berlin and brussels , at the right time to tell .
i think that scotland is better working in loose european system that we provided their own currency can be executed .
other similar thinking in europe that will be easier to work with the federal countries and countries .
otherwise , we should go on the way नॉrave its economic freedom to think about .
scotland s . n . p . ullekhaniyana government - as the most successful political campaign , which the chancellor is europe parsimony - labor yeiliyaraste darling introduced by ( and carry out the cuts , and after that , on the basis of the year in 2011 , amazingly dema alliance - libaas ) had won a majority .
scotland to vote for independence , this time to talk nonsense , because in that case it by berlin and brussels to accept the rules will have to be the parsimony .
