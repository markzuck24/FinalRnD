bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend , to treat hundreds of patients
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one in 5,000 people
here you vote or from your mobile device
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 cnn heroes of 2013 . &quot;
you can for him , or any of the other heroes in the top 10 , in order to &quot; cnn hero of the year .
the winner receives $ 250,000 to continue her exceptional work .
21 years , georges bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals that do not have the means at their disposal to help him .
jamef bwelle was in a car accident near yaoundé , the capital of cameroon , injured .
first , he had a broken arm , but then formed an inflammation , expanding on his brain and caused a hematoma , the impact for the rest of his life .
&quot; there were no neurochirurgen in cameroon , &quot; said georges bwelle .
we would have released him from cameroon , if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals , in order to get the treatment that they had to offer .
&quot; it is not easy , &quot; said bwelle .
at five o &apos;clock in the morning , you can leave the house and run the hospital , in order to be the first , and it is not the first .
there are very many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has scarcely changed since bwelles father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , the ratio in the united states with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most cameroonians visiting .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of health spending in the country are private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; says bwelle .
and the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father , and so many of his countrymen are allowed to ripen bwelle decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team last year 700 free operations carried out .
he was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
in addition , he founded a nonprofit organization called asco vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people .
he squeezed almost every friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and proceed with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help .
everything is not always smooth .
more than once they had the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be welcomed as heroes : a banquet , singing and dancing and the best accommodation , the place has to offer .
in these villages is free medical care is really a cause for celebration and bwelle - with its broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyful celebration .
the next morning , the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients .
&quot; we are dealing with 500 people per ride , &quot; bwelle .
you come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village - and on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are due to malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team simple operations with local anesthesia .
the operations are normally in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the surgery , the patient and go in the relaxation area , in order to make room for the next .
the illumination of the op and disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the group and so bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours on sunday .
it is a demanding job , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
&quot; they drum all night to stay awake and so that we can continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday , the team goes back into the city , tired , but proud of the work that has been done .
the group - a mix of cameroonian doctors and medical students - in the past year has 700 free operations carried out and know that their work is an enormous difference for the people , which helps .
a man explained that the free operation of a &apos; , which he received now allows him to return to work .
&quot; the change the future of my family , &quot; said the man .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital at night bwelle works in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job , he financed 60 % of its charitable activities , bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
&quot; i really do not know when he sleeps , &quot; says katie o &apos;malley , in the second year at drexel university in philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in bwelles group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization , so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the united states and europe and support bwelle , this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home .
&quot; we can be in operations , where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the tools for dr. bwelle , &quot; says o &apos;malley .
this would be in america as a medical student in the second year never possible .
the students typically pay for their trip to cameroon and often donated medical material .
but they are only once in yaoundé , bwelle accommodation , transport and guide .
&quot; he is without doubt a hero , &quot; says o &apos;malley .
he devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of cameroon , knows no bounds .
for bwelle is the almost constant work , not a burden .
the other to a happier life , and in order to fulfil a promise that he has given to his father gives him great joy .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy if i make this work , &quot; says bwelle .
and i think of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it in order to bring people back to laugh and to relieve pain .

cardinals are the most senior clerics in the catholic church after pope and they are the ones who choose a pope , francis to appoint the first group of men , which will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor .
currently there are 201 cardinals .

in a statement , in which the news was announced , said father federico lombardi , a spokesman for the vatican , there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony on the appointment of the new cardinals will be held , also known as a consistory .
&quot; pope francis has decided that its decision to convene the children in february to announce in advance , so that other meetings , the participation of the cardinals from around the world , can be planned , &quot; said lombardi .
jack valero of catholic voices , said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be dropped until february .
he said that a pope those normally so many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals 120 measured again , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he would like .
the consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of francis in march this year , valero .
there are currently some overhang on the part of europe , especially italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope cardinals from the rest of the world will appoint to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first since the formation of the council of cardinals , founded by francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world , responsible ways to reform the church .

yougov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders , the british companies , sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow , while states in the eu will stagnate .
they want the government to new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil are promoted , instead of dealing with the long and arduous process , to reform the obscure institutions .
asked for their opinion on certain legal issues - from fair trading legislation to product legislation - the majority of business leaders think that control over the key competences should be returned to westminster .
there was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market , since according to the company , the cost of the brussels rules now would outweigh the advantages to be part of europe &apos;s trade - even 40 percent of large companies , which have traditionally voted the most europhile .
finally , and this is probably the most , our survey of business leaders that a clear majority of britain a course in the direction of change in the agreement and wants a relationship with the eu based on trade , not on politics .
this recognition for companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is on a &quot; meaningful change &quot; which the tiller will bring back to the uk .
there is a lot of - a change in the agreement and better conditions for the uk would be a change at 16 per cent in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of the uk &apos;s terms of eu membership .
it also shows that the company from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now in the direction of closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority should be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows what companies greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in approach to regulation .

gutach : more safety for pedestrians
you are not 100 yards apart : tuesday is the new b 33-fußgängerampel in gutach at the village car park in operation - within sight of the old town hall .
two installations so close to each other : intention or folly ?
this question has been answered clearly gutachs mayor yesterday .
&quot; the traffic lights have been installed at the time , because it makes the school , &quot; said eckert yesterday .
the kluser-ampel secure both cyclists as well as account holders and the bergle-bewohner .
the official yesterday in plant is important for the intersection area sulzbachweg / kirch street .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank and the flow from the residential area &quot; grub . &quot;
&quot; during the high traffic and pedestrian safety had to come up with another set of traffic lights , &quot; says eckert .
this is confirmed by peter arnold roll from germany .
&quot; according to current measurements through the b 33 around 12 000 vehicles in the municipality of gutach , about ten percent of heavy traffic , &quot; said arnold .
so is the construction of a new traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; security is simply , &quot; says arnold .
a total of four traffic had been carried out at a roundabout was under consideration , but because of the narrowness of the intersection area sulzbachweg / kirchstraße ignored .
it was , according to arnold in the siting of the traffic light poles previously tested everything : &quot; using a specially for us with extra long holzstämmen loaded trucks we have ever engaged in , whether these vehicles from the sulzbachweg exit onto b 33 without the traffic light poles umzuknicken . &quot;
the approximately eur 15 000 expensive traffic light itself is the &quot; state of the art , which is currently on the market , &quot; explained arnold .
the plant is equipped with coloured leds that shine so strongly that the lights of the car drivers , for example , when the sun is good .
and economically , it is also : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three lights per direction .
arnold said the technology of the new facility is equipped with two radar sensors .
the traffic light pushes the button , tests the upper radar sensor the traffic .
the street is free , just green for pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for pedestrians .
&quot; should be a group or disabled people on the streets , the green phase , it is everyone safe on the road , &quot; said arnold .
of course , the drivers should be here as a partner and the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the green light for pedestrians , a kid doesn &apos;t get through - in bright red .

foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to &quot; authenticity test &quot;
the government is under additional measures on a &quot; purity test &quot; for foreign workers on 457 visas .
the test should be introduced , it would be a criterion that should prevent the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the migration of family and friends in australia .
today , the government published a proposal for discussion , after the former members of the labor party , maxine mckew , the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers , because of its neighbours australia could be seen as an insult .
&quot; the loud declarations like , foreigners are back &quot; and &quot; first stop , australians are a very unpalatable back at a time when unions demanded a protected labour market , &quot; she said the australia india institute today .
historically , this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the region , an echo of this historic artifact vernähmen , i would not be surprised .
the proposal outlines 12 measures , once the former immigration minister chris bowen thought .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor yesterday to discuss trafficking in sri lanka , has five of the recommended changes are implemented , the others are still under consideration .
if the &quot; authenticity &quot; criterion , it could be someone who applied for a visa , &quot; whether the request is authentic in cases in which the applicant with the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring company related or connected personally . &quot;
companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457-visumsinhaber , after the company in the past , only a small number of workers wanted to support , finally hundreds .

on the subject of transport , this friday is not on the agenda , the spd has underpinned their &apos; no &apos; to a toll of the csu required .
a vignette is a &quot; flat for much drive and environmentally counter-productive , &quot; explained the spd-verhandlungsführer for the issue of transport , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
it threatened ausweichverkehre on country roads , which already black spots .
the introduction of a toll for passenger cars , also from the point of view of pronolds would be only a first step .

in close consultation with the authorities is now the warning signs with technical measures to keep quiet .
he will continue to have an open dialogue with our neighbours .
because matthias schrell still has a few things planned at the site .

tripodi denies being influenced by obeid
against the former labor party minister joe tripodi from new south wales , an investigation by the state corruption on view .
the former nsw-minister denies the regulations on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid to have changed , the covert investments in three properties on state controlled land .
the independent commission against corruption ( icac ­ independent commission against corruption ) on friday extended its investigations on the question of whether different minister obeid influenced such leases at circular quay , where the obeids two restaurants and a cafe , without tender after their expiration in august 2005 .
now , because of the accusation , tripodi said of obeids concealed interest in the land , after tripodis former deputy team leader lynne ashpole accordingly on thursday .
in years of talks , which began in 2005 , the government had to public tenders for the leases .
tenants were opposed to it , and also wanted to longer maturities .
in 2009 , the leases at circular quay for the companies , which the obeids $ 2.5 million per year , without a public tender .
tripodi , from february 2006 to november 2009 port minister , had originally called for public tenders .
but he denied that the changes made at the request of obeid and tripodi , as confirmed in a reorganisation of the lease arrangements had urged the government .
one of the icac &apos;s telephone was written down talks from the august and september 2007 between obeid and tripodi , and steve dunn , a senior officials who had moved into the harbor department , having in the fisheries authority under obeid had worked .
&quot; it was the issue at stake in these telephone calls the drafting of the commercial leasing regulations ? &quot; asked the deputy commissioner anthony whealy tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; tripodi said .
i do not recall what was discussed , but it was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
nsa-enthüllungen strengthen corporate paranoia because of state control
on a mild day at the end of august , a german flew low over the new united states embassy in frankfurt am main , germany &apos;s financial capital .
on the instructions of the federal office for intelligence and counter-terrorism ( bat ) , the german secret service inside , he should take the roof of the us-außenpostens , less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
according to german media wanted the crown to prove the existence of monitoring antennas and the action has led to an exchange of words between the united states and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , was once again in september that the united states has no possibility of foreign espionage , &quot; the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of american companies to steal their international competitiveness or increase their profits . &quot;
but since , the whistleblowers that the former employees , with the publication of his filling horn of us surveillance secrets has started , european governments and employers are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .
reports that the us national security agency spied on the brazilian oil company petrobas and data of us cloud providers , including google and yahoo , have acquired the corporate paranoia because of state supervision to a new record .
the last straw was the revelation that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone was verwanzt , possibly for ten years .
when the most powerful person in europe targeted , managements are also potential targets .
no , the intensive cooperation between us intelligence agencies and companies made transparent .
i think that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany needs to wake up , &quot; says oliver green , president of bitmi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the united states was now an almost as big a risk as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey in july , which was published by the consultancy firm ey .
in the documents leaked by snowden , however , there has been no evidence so far that the united states is the trade secrets of foreign companies on their own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu lacked certain it and internet options and they reduce their dependence on the united states .
the companies are sceptical .
in parliament , it has been proposed that we should build a german google .
i can close my eyes and open them again ...
&quot; that is not how things work , &quot; said hasso plattner , sap chairman of the german software .
if you have a strong european it industry had wanted , then they would not die out 20 years ago .
in germany , subsidised by the coal on cars to agriculture .
everything , except for the it industry .
however , the reach and technical sophistication of the snowden-enthüllungen us-spionagebehörden revealed companies that shocked the biggest espionage risk seen in china .
the cloud computing will be a big change , because european leaders are now aware that data stored in the us are subject to the law and is therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to one of the cloud security alliance , a trade body , did a survey after the revelations about the us data mining activities with prism , approximately 10 % of the members are not resident in the united states , plans to use an american supplier .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : &quot; we see a new issue of customers that there was not yet a year ago - it is : where will my data is stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this area ? &quot;
many german executives take the view that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew : that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and , therefore , must be defended at all costs .
that industrial espionage , is no surprise .
this has always been the case .
&quot; it was an issue for many years and the current discussion has not fundamentally changed , &quot; said kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans spy on commercial and industrial level , as we do , too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the company does not normally on the action it has taken , which affords attackers benefits .
in large companies , employees , moreover , for a long time that the export of a free usb sticks at a trade fair or unguarded behind a laptop in a hotel room is not advisable , to say the least .

the financing for a period of four years , after government consultations with tasmanian independent mp andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has an emergency rescue package , which , in our view , the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; said plibersek today .
the 325-millionen-dollar-paket covers 31 million dollars in emergency aid for services .
another 2,600 operations , including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey star , residues should be eliminated .
in addition , there is money for days clinics in hobart and launceston , better follow-up care after inpatient stays , specialist in the field of mental health services , and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health information in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments are in line with the ideas , the clinic staff have said that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , &quot; said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tasmanian government .
the state needs to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the commonwealth , and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent .
a three-man commission will be set up and to ensure that the state of health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today the 325 million dollars would only make little difference if they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that the public tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course . &quot;
nevertheless , he praised the government for having its request for urgent aid , which he first reacted to the prime minister expressed at the beginning of may .
&quot; i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health care system of the state to the list , &quot; said wilkie .

but the federal opposition health spokesman peter dutton , believes that today &apos;s announcement was just a &quot; band-aid solution . &quot;

it is not acceptable that a state government almost half a billion dollars away from the system and the commonwealth 300 million hinein and then act as if the good news .

proverbs from the bible
more than 40 women visited the last women breakfast this year in the protestant parish bisingen .
theme of the day in the city were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; phrases from the middle ages . &quot;
zita köhler , the chairman of the parish-fosters , went to breakfast in a lecture to the biblical sayings .
&quot; proverbs contain facts , rules or warnings , &quot; she said .
they compared several hours with the relevant biblical passages and explained the importance .
she called sayings like : wood eye should be alert to the fact , keep an eye on someone throw , there &apos;s the lord in sleep , wash its hands .
several times , the speaker also advise their listeners , saying it was .
the phrases from the middle ages , the kirchengemeinderätin christel dehner : all good things come in threes , blue , something surrounded .
she stated the meaning and origin of the phrases that they &quot; bridges to the past . &quot;
finally , a raffle .
the prices were covered on a table and were humorous , before they were handed over to the winners .
among the visitors to the breakfast also interfered in mommsenschlösschen mayoral candidate novel .
you could call him the dostoyevsky in the united states .
philip k. dick was a god , a meta physicist , his novels and stories have something serial .
amazingly the kinship abroad : the sharp eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fyodor dostoevsky , with its massive oeuvre as ergründer and apologist for the russian soul , read philip k. dick as american prophet , there is something in their own country .
some of the titles are published in the mid-to-late publisher , which sells haffmans-kassette with 118 stories zweitausendeins .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technological advances , coupled with paranoia , obsession and the faith , to be chosen .
thick had god experiences , his later books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .
he has already figured , early on that the computer divinitäten .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what differentiates humans from a machine , the creator of his creation .
this is the &apos; blade runner &apos; problem .
the killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have directors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
this story is particularly significant .
&quot; minority report &quot; dates back to the year 1956 , he exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy-tribunale .
it is the principle of &quot; pre- crime &apos; , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , in other words , what is now more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dick &apos;s world , which is our shocking , mutants in the future and to the police .
&quot; we collect against individuals who have broken no law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we catch them before they can commit a violent crime . &quot;
and : &quot; in our society , there are no criminals , we have a colony of pesudoverbrecher . &quot; you read time flows .
they assume that bad things are happening , and prevent the criminal idea into practice .
dick &apos;s story acts as the blueprint for the fda and the nsa abhörrausch .
anticipation of the attack : so does obama &apos;s drones philosophy and practice .
but dick &apos;s story is not yet at an end .
the police chief complains that there is no separation of powers , the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the state .
then the monitor itself monitors and a future crime .
the system is .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it creates its own conditions .
errors and victims is not only accepted , but builds on itself .
the system creates the risk that it fights .
philip k. dick read is , again and again , to get closer to the truth .
court decision to block the nypd stop-and-frisk-richtlinie
a federal appeals court in the united states on thursday blocked the formation of a judge , the changes to the stop-and-frisk-programm ( &quot; stop and search &quot; ) of the new york police department had demanded , and for the judge of the case .
the 2nd repercussions said that the decisions by judge shira scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal is decided in the city .
the judge had ruled in august that the city goes against the constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people will be implemented .
the city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures , including the decision to set up an observatory , which the police with the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training programme should support .
the court of appeal on tuesday heard the arguments for the suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case , because it violates the code of conduct for u.s. judges , specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship ; this was , in part , with a series of media interviews and public statements , in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the court .
the judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were inappropriately targeted black and latin american men with the stop and frisk program were targeted .
it has appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of key changes , including reforms to policies , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with the body worn cameras in areas in which most of the checks were carried out .
in august , the city of new york , the practice of storing the names and addresses of people to quit , following an inspection by the police .
an oral hearing on the appeal is scheduled for march 14 , 2014 .
the stop-and-frisk-taktik was made by a number of civil rights advocates criticized .
it is this type of inspection for decades in various forms , but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the other independents mayor michael bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and latin american men .
in 2004 by four men , who were all minorities have complained that developed into a class action lawsuit .
supporters of the changes say the nypd stop-and-frisk-programm , the changes will put an end to unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way as other police chiefs of the ruling .
opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not the crime ; it would also waste money and the wider problem of a police force is not resolved , after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure .
the judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-frisk-praxis , constitutional , but only the kind of implementation of controls by the nypd reformiere .
anger over judgement for bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people in the bombing in bali in 2002 killed , were angry about the verdict for the last of the plotters , who was put on trial , because umar patek they believe state law should be shot .

there has also been a guilty verdict in a number of terrorism related charges , including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
the prosecution had asked for a life sentence , even if it is for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomb maker - also known as &quot; demolition man &quot; to apply the death penalty .
the decision has sparked painful memories in june corteen , a mother from perth , the 39 year-old twin daughters jane and jenny in patek and his mitverschwörern devastation caused nearly ten years ago .
fighting back tears , she said , patek could be sentenced to death .
i mean , he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; it should be put before a firing squad , &quot; said corteen to aap .
i have to live with it every day , that i will have no further grandchildren and i will never see my daughters .
the sari club was razed to the ground , on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 11 p.m. , a powerful bomb exploded in a light truck , which was parked in front of the nightclub .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers detonate a backpack filled with explosives .
after the attack , he fell into a coma for a month and &quot; died &quot; three times while he was on a life support system .
hughes said that patek , deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of jemaah islamiah-amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra , who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago .
really , this guy should get the death penalty .
let him alive - no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
20 years on , after he 202 people were killed and hundreds injured , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali-bomber , who was in court .
he is almost a decade of detention , but was finally in january 2011 in the pakistani town of abbottabad , where us forces nearly four months later , the former al-qaeda chief osama bin laden killed .
during the trial , an fbi agent said that intelligence reports had made the point that patek was in pakistan , in order to meet bin laden with the aim of making the link between the southeast asian terrorist groups and al-qaeda .
&quot; he has not been asked , &quot; said corteen .
until recently , he has shown no remorse for it , how much pain he has caused to other people .
the ruling came before the 10th anniversary of the attack in this year , with commemorations in bali and australia .
&quot; this year there will be many tears , &quot; said corteen .
patek can still appeal against his sentence .

the canadian aircraft and train maker bombardier inc reported on thursday a 15-prozentigen fall in net profit , after declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contract problems in the railway sector was under pressure .
bombardier , based in montreal , no flight test data for its new cseries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane , according to the ambitious timetable next september could go into commercial use .
on the maiden flight of the test aircraft from one and a half months followed so far , only three more launches what it seems questionable whether the trial as planned .
the results were behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent of the stock exchange of toronto .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , on thursday lowered its rating from &quot; outperform &quot; to &quot; sector perform &quot; in view of the fact that the stock in the next one or two quarters of a limited course potential .
&quot; the weaker suppliers have been charged with aircraft as expected , but the margin development in the transport sector , we are clearly disappointed , &quot; doerksen said in a client .
we believe that new orders for bombardier cseries , if the testing program for the plane .
however , if in the coming months will be announced no new orders , then we expect that the market will be sceptical about the programme .
bombardier hopes that the cseries aircraft the company can catapult into the lower segment , which is currently dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test plane was presented to the public in march , after months of delays and flew for the first time in september .
but so far , binding orders for the cseries with 177 moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flights and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft is correct .
currently , there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier his goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets will achieve .
the company said on thursday with analysts and the media , the program is on schedule .
&quot; the test aircraft remained on the ground is no longer than expected , &quot; said beaudoin during a conference call and added , while the service life of the aircraft had been scheduled ground testing and software updates .
each manufacturer is planning .
we have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , which is what we have done .
this is happening during the entire flight programme .
the second of five test planes will be expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said by the company .
however , analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer for the cseries aircraft in operation .
bombardier said that it check the planning for the operation ( eis ) and will update this in the next few months .
&quot; the slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 is shifting , &quot; doerksen said .
in the third quarter with bombardiers end on september 30 , net income fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents , unchanged .
sales slipped slightly after and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4,56 million expected , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
net orders fell by 83 aircraft at 26 .
the order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on september 30 and was unchanged compared with december 31 .
&quot; in the field of aerospace , the results in the context of our targets , but the low order intake and the market as a whole were disappointing , &quot; said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bombardier , the world &apos;s biggest train manufacturer , announced that sales in this division by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector , on 30 september , amounted to $ 32.6 billion , compared with december 31 , slightly increased .

rules on electronic devices on planes remain in force for the time being in australia
australian airline passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones off during takeoff and landing , despite efforts in the united states , the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) , us airlines to change their guidelines , so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight , read books , videos or , if they can play in the &quot; flight mode . &quot;
while the majority of the flight , passengers already allowed , but many people find it annoying that the launch and landing are not allowed to read their e-books .
australian companies are watching the decision , on the implementation of the us airlines have to do a lot of work , but have no immediate plans to change their rules .
the air safety agency casa also said that we would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in australia still apply .
&quot; casa currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices on the plane , &quot; was announced .
the issue is subject to rules , according to which the safety of all airlines and passengers must follow instructions given by the cabin crew .
virgin has already with the casa talks on an extension of its use wi-fi entertainment system on flights and said that he is open to changes , but they must be initiated by the legislator .

qantas said that for the time being , remain in the current regulations .
&quot; our current guidelines that electronic devices during takeoff and landing cannot be used , and we currently have no plans to change this , &quot; said the company .
the faa-regelungen apply for us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations , which will benefit passengers , and the faa decision and the reasons behind this certainly is .
the decision is in us airlines vary depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage and customer guidance change .

on saturday , october 26 , this extraordinary exhibition from 19 during the evening martinus mass in the church and on sunday , october 27 , from 10 a.m. at the funeral service at st. john baptist church in varnishes village .
the so-called deutsche messe with the eagles &apos; song to celebrate the holy victim of the exhibition , &quot; d 872 , is a spiritual music works of the composer franz schubert from 1826 and was at the time of the creation of almost as revolutionary .
the fair will be listed in the context of the services , such as the client johann philipp neumann it had in mind .
under the direction of hermann schneider , the choir of the brass group of the musikverein joy tennenbronn and noemi lokodi on the organ .
scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which the tail is wagging the dog with his mood .
previous research had shown that happy dogs with the cock stretched more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while the left side was nervous dogs .
but now , scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and be able to respond .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the university of trento , said : &quot; when people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli , causing the positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we have tried to look at this in other species .
he also noticed that dogs , like humans , the speech for the movement of the left side was responsible and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .
to learn more about how dogs on the side of the tail is wagging their brethren , the researchers monitored the animals , while these films of other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the dog and analysed the behaviour .
probably we will soon understand why the tail in one , in the other direction .
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette , in order to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we were able to make the movement of the tail more control to the left or to the right . &quot;
when they saw how an otherwise expression of loose dog the tail has moved to the right ( from the perspective of the fronds of dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but was the tail tilt to the left ( again , from the perspective of the dog , the wags ) , your heart rate rose and they saw restless .
in the opinion of professor vallortigara , the dogs were not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learnt from experience , in which movements they worry if and when they are not .
he said : &quot; if you have several encounters with other dogs and the wedeln with the cock in one direction rather with friendly behaviour and the right side is a less friendly behaviour , then it is on the basis of this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal could help .
john bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the faculty of animal husbandry at the university of bristol , said that this is not the first study , which has been investigated , whether on the left and right is important for dogs .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln that dogs turn your head to the left , if they see an aggressive dog , and to the right , if it is a happy dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada , said the following : &quot; dogs tend to go on , if a robot dog , tail wag &quot; on the left and the right , rather than the other way around years - than in the italian study . &quot;
according to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robot dogs are not as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs , could help , he said .
&quot; although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves to be used for different purposes , but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception , &quot; said bradshaw .
but simply because their behaviour record , it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one , sometimes in the other direction .

&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house there is all my money in it , &quot; says amir thal inga .
although they each month of 3,000 singapore dollars ( ca 1.730 ) as an administrative worker deserves and her husband work , rich monthly income , they explained .
indeed , the demand in parts of southeast asia - where the indebtedness of households is increasing - so great that valuemax , where they made their exchange , this week was the third pawn shop , which is listed on the singapore stock exchange .
the pledge of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money - 1,300 singapore in the case of janani amir thal inga - but almost as good as an unsecured bank loans .
typically verlangen pawnshops in singapore , an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent , just above the 15.4 % , which requires the united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .
pawnshops offer but the advantage is that there is no review of credit or income required under way , which is why loans faster than banks .
for this reason , millions of people in the region to pawnshops , after families of the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose monetary policy in developed economies are looking for families with lower and middle incomes pawnshops on , in order to compensate for the difference in stotternder economy .

malaysia , thailand and singapore , according to the agency , the highest household debt in relation to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia is 80 percent of gdp at the top of the list , an increase of 60 percent in 2008 .
economists are also due to the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week just emerged from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a fall in consumer demand .
&quot; in effect , this means that , in the face of rising costs , the people in the middle to lower end of the income scale ( ) will try to supplement their income , wherever possible , &quot; said song seng , economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
historic highs in gold prices in the past two years , the trend for pawning personal items , as people take the opportunity , the decoration of the family in cash .
in singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawn shops of the city of gold .
people say : &quot; the gold price looks good , let us pledge grandmother &apos;s gold chain and back next month . &quot;
the biggest thai pawn operator , easy money , has in its stores a 20 % growth seen in recent months .
the growth in the mortgage business is so strong that valuemax , operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 other in singapore , not only in the neighboring malaysia wants to expand - where the company operates four houses - but also outside asia , yeah lee ching , managing director of valuemax .
the company is financing it with 60 percent of the 66 million singapore , which this week with the ipo in singapore .
while some lenders because of high interest rates were caught in the crossfire , said yeah that pawnshops does not only lower interest rates than other lenders offer , but also not directly increase the debt .
&quot; customers valuable items that they already have , and that treat personal valuables does not increase the budget for training , &quot; she explained .
the pawn loan business is increasingly socially accepted as a short-term secured funding .
also , not all people who use pawn shop in financial difficulties .
rich people come from singapore in the branches of valuemax , gold and rolex watches to pledge what they are up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
clients come to us from every social class .
&quot; these include incomes in the short term for a business or an investment , or small businesses , which have to bridge the bottlenecks in the cash flow , &quot; says yeah .

i look forward to the report with the british ministers in the next year to study and work together to decide on the next steps .
live with good prospects
waltraud ries is fantastic .
her house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with a lot of green , an old trees , nice neighbours , and not too much traffic .
in the city , there are only a few minutes by public transportation .
&quot; i hope you have no fear of spiders ? &quot; asks waltraud ries and shows a big spider at the door .
i &apos;m looking for some time , a new apartment for my husband and me .
but you know how difficult it is in stuttgart .
the reason is , however , no spider phobia , but the concern , at the age of the many steps to the house and in the apartment is no longer able to cope , she says .
in addition , since one of the fifty erin meniskus-operation has experienced what it means to deal with a handicap from floor to floor .
recently she published a book on the subject of &apos; the tender age - what living form is the best for me ? &apos; .
&quot; our apartment is the best example of what the age is not the issue , it begins to tell .
as more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle 50 waltraud ries thinks otherwise .
you also know that it is one of the few people who could , with the theme &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most of the crowd out there , as long as it is .
old only the other &apos; , says she humorous .
only when the suffering is really great , we will do .
&quot; then it may be too late , &quot; &apos; .
in her book , the interior designer 17 living models for a self-determined housing in old age .
&apos;what living form you choose , however , is always an individual decision , &quot; she explains .
d i e solution , it does not give the age .
even if the residency in tuscany or brittany could afford should always consider that he could be ill .
and : &apos; without a good knowledge of the language of the club is also playing in the dolce vita , &quot; the specialist book author relocation candidates in mind .
under their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing , or the often quoted rentner-wg .
in old age , everyone has his tics and quirks
&apos;for me would be nothing but a residents &apos; , says with a wink .
certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; at the age you just need his retreat , &quot; says ries .
a senior living community can still work , the author , however , cannot be ruled out .
but then it differently than in the classic studenten-wg .
and sometimes you just want to only his rest &apos; , she believes .
with this view , at least in the capital , it is not alone .
&quot; most old people want in stuttgart , as long as it is in their own home , is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital .
the department advises people around the theme of &apos; age &apos; .
therefore , especially elderly people would often inconveniences and restrictions , just to stay in their familiar surroundings , this is also the experience of the stiftung warentest .
there are many possibilities , the house or apartment buildings .
ries recommends all who deal with age appropriate rebuilding their house or apartment , only to be properly informed and not the best craftsmen .
today , there is also the age appropriate restructuring specialists .
even in the apartment is one or the other , and if it is only increasing the toilet seat , clarifies the interior designer .
but not always , the existing apartment age and thus transform accessible , even if they are so beautiful .
this experience was waltraud ries .
although we could install a chair inside the apartment , with stairs paved path to the front door but it would be a much bigger obstacle .
it will proceed to the ideal property for herself and her husband .
before the move horrified her more than before the spider on her front door .

cocaine addict lawyer , the drug boss , police investigation , must go to prison
basharat form , 42 , gave information to continue under world size neil scarborough
the lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction could come to light
liverpool crown court he was sentenced to three years in prison
a well-known criminal defender , a drugs baron with a major police investigation , because he was afraid his secret addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat form , 42 , disappeared under the world size neil scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after looking through his own cocaine had been compromised .
the kriminalisten as &quot; first class &quot; vaunted lawyer with the nickname &quot; bash &quot; was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police had monitored scarborough , which he represented in a previous drug procedures .
officials observed how scarborough ( 32 ) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , parenting , while this with colleagues during a meal at the bar .
the investigation brought to light that form of class a drugs regularly consumed after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards were found .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he attempted unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of its partners .
all four suspects were from the police as part of a major corporation to heroin- and cocaine trafficking in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
along with 32 other people were later arrested after the police during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200,000 in cash .
legally , 42 , gave information to criminals , because he feared that his drug addiction cannot be known .
today , filling in for the firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , at liverpool crown court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice found guilty and sentenced .
he admitted at an earlier hearing to cocaine possession .
the lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations against scarborough found that this in february 2011 in regular telephone contact with turkey .
two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to dittas house and the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , called scarborough regularly with turkey , at dinner in the football stadium of blackburn rovers in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , took drugs and then nine messages exchanged between the two .
in court , it became known that form a regular consumer of cocaine , after tests of class a drugs in his hair , his wallet and credit cards were discovered .
l was later arrested but denied to take cocaine , and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer , because this was his client , and claimed that their discussion is governed by the &quot; lawyer secret . &quot;
during his arrest form took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they have been secured and he was taken from a hair sample .
he was in the police interrogation , both in his home and in the workplace , an office and clients it at home because of legal issues .
in court , it was announced that the major players in the drug trade , some of which he had earlier called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : &quot; a criminal law should know better than anyone else that breaking the law . &quot;
is this form of abuse of his position as defence lawyers accused , because he is too much with certain clients .
the relationship is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these people .
but that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was the police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr form brought his profession into disrepute .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scarborough , and he caused that his independence was compromised .
wrote , any wrongdoing , and said : &quot; if i were a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and wanted to pass on information to scarborough , then i would not wait for 15 hours , but do it right away . &quot;
but after the hearing , said superintendent lee halstead of the police in lancashire : &quot; mr wrote , the step from a criminal to a criminal in the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , which hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and public trust and confidence .
l has betrayed that trust and tries to get behind the façade of his profession .
the serious and organised crime unit of lancashire led the investigation against turkey , in three cases to a conviction for possession of cocaine and obstructing justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we will find you and bring you to justice .
scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison on the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade declared guilty .
thirty-five others &apos; people were involved in the drug trade to total penalties of 153 years sentence for drug offences .
published on its website a collecting area with questions and answers about where he is , his dream job , as a lawyer for clients on death row in america , his ultimate guest at the dinner was mohammed ali and inequality is the motivation for his work .
until now , the police inspection agencies on a quiet halloween-nacht .
the officials were only two eggs throwing children , which threw them against facades .
as the owner of this timely detected and the eggs remains equally remote , should not be material damage .
furthermore , the city probably some sylvesterböller detonated , but there is no material damage .
a resident in bischof-freundorfer-weg reported that his car wrapped in toilet paper and its radzierblenden were stolen .

the council is targeting tracks
the railway crossing &quot; am hirschen &quot; expenditure , in order to improve road safety ?
yes , the local councillors have decided .
schiltach must eur 220 000 .
deutsche bahn wants to improve the kinzigtal-bahnstrecke in the coming year .
in particular the safety at level crossings be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions between trains with other vehicles .
the transformed into communities , they have to deal with a third of the cost , and the rest are divided .
schiltachs city architect roland grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the bahübergangs &quot; am hirschen . &quot;
there is the city , in the amount of the tunnel mouth , west of the railway tracks to build a bulge .
there could also be more vehicles , for example , those who transported long timber at oncoming traffic , without having to block the tracks .
grießhaber proposed , to construct a retaining wall so that the city of the subsequent street could expand at the appropriate time , in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow .
this was discussed in the council is controversial , since some councils need roads were spreading in doubt : thomas tilt , saying the mood of the critics : &quot; because we have so few cars so much money ? &quot;
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing hirschen will regularly used for long wood shipments .
even wood from the area &quot; kuhbach &quot; will be transported via this route , in part because the vehicles of up to 20 metres long the route could use the häberlesbrücke not because they could not turn in the road .
in addition , the track served as a diversion for those vehicles which are not allowed to use the tunnel , if the road is blocked , haas .
as expected , that church and castle mountain tunnel rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in wolfach , the railway crossing &quot; am hirschen for a longer period is an important traffic significance .
the council agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed expansion of the street .
despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing largely agreed with the proviso that the retaining wall will be built in such a way that the city of the subsequent road &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; possibly for meeting traffic at around 5.5 m building .
the railway crossing in the tanning trautwein , on the other hand , could be a quite different problem , which the access in the rising &quot; geroltzhäuser way &apos; .
the administration had the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering study breinlinger , because they had doubts about whether the planned end of geroltzhäuser route will still be possible without further ado .
the study concluded that cannot be ruled out that the conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles .
the responsibility for carrying the city as a road last winner .
therefore , could the restructuring liability disputes .
since both the collection and the turning in the current state of development should be worked , the reconstruction of the railway crossing , henman argued .
also at this point is the risk of a collision with a car on the transition are significantly lower than in the other rail crossings , because the next stop in the middle , a good sight .
even trains from the main railway station , this would have to be slowed down so far that there is no danger of a collision .
mostly , the reconstruction of this railway crossing denied the agreement , since the city schiltach , the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles &quot; should suffer the consequences , &quot; according to the councils , as the train after the completion of the construction could withdraw from the responsibility .
the body is seen as the changes on the level crossings &quot; before running &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach , &quot; for the intersection of agreements with the train .

she is appealing against a jail sentence in thailand
a 21-year old woman from sydney in phuket was sentenced to 15 days in prison because they had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .
stevie rochelle bamford was initially by a provincial court in phuket on 15 june , a not guilty , after she had indicated to the thai police , a local taxi driver in the early hours on sunday , 10 june , raped , while two other men grabbed them .
later , however , the photographs showed a video camera that they are safe in their hotel , having been separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford two days until they confessed , the story up .
until the trial is in police custody .
bamford was still a prison sentence in a prison with a low level of security at the edge of phuket , instead of in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-liga at the ministry of foreign affairs in canberra with a request for assistance for his daughter .
tunks told the sunday telegraph in sydney , the whole family is &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back in australia .
&quot; we are obviously very concerned , but we hope that they will be as soon as possible back home , &quot; said tunks .
bamford has appealed against the verdict and is on bail of 50,000 baht at large .
in australian reports was to read that , in the meantime , in the resort of krabi in thailand on holiday .
the court was to hear , bamford will by a local lawyer in phuket and had been warned that the appeal also to impose a higher penalty of up to two years in prison for adults .
however , it is also possible that thailand after the recent murder of travel purchase wife michelle smith in phuket could try to improve its tarnished touristic image , and it therefore comes to an acquittal .

syria has its ability to manufacture chemical weapons destroyed , a monitoring group
syria have facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gitftgasmunition destroyed , explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on thursday , while in the north of the country to heavy clashes near one of the sites , where suspected toxic substances are stored .
also on thursday , a group of syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago had been killed .
the announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the deadline
november 1 , the organisation based in the hague , damascus had set all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons to destroy or &quot; were , &quot; including all the machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of the destruction , is an important milestone for an ambitious timetable , on the destruction of all syria &apos;s chemical weapons by the middle of 2014 .
the destruction of the institutions means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
damascus has yet to begin , however , the existing weapons and to destroy stockpiles .
estimates suggest that there are in the country and about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when fighting on thursday took place in the town of safira , experts say that there is a facility for chemical weapons production and storage facilities , such as the uk-based syrian observatory for human rights said .
the activist group , which has a network of activists in syria , the number of deaths , said on thursday , 120.296 people have died .
these are 6.365 61.067 civilians , including children .
on the government side were 29.954 of them the army of president bashar assad , 18.678 are pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
also among the dead were 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of people killed in the conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has approximately two million people have been forced to flee the country .
assad &apos;s troops for weeks in safira fight against the rebels , many of whom have links to al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said it voted on thursday losses on both sides , but no details .
the fighting underscores the risk that are exposed to the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria &apos;s toxic arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a brutal civil war .
according to the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , is the team &quot; now convinced that all of these important production and mixing / filling equipment and has witnessed their destruction . &quot;
therefore , &quot; are currently planned no further inspection activities . &quot;
at the beginning of the week , the inspectors said that they have completed the first round of checks and 21 out of 23 sites declared by damascus .
due to security concerns is the visit of two institutions would not have been possible , said the inspectors .
on thursday , the opwc , the two sites have been abandoned , according to the syrian statement ... &quot; and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other indicated bodies that have been inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two institutions , which have not been able to visit the opcw-inspektoren .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , the next month , the executive committee of the opwc must be approved .
&quot; i salute the bravery and the courage that you all while fulfilling the most challenging mission that has ever been executed by this organisation , have shown , &quot; said ahmed uzumcu , the director-general of the opcw monitoring organisation in a published commentary .
for three years , the mainly sunni muslim rebels are fighting in the civil war against assad &apos;s government and its security forces , many members of the alawites , a secession of shia islam .
in terms of further developments , said the head of the monitoring group , rami abdurrahman , it was a strong explosion on wednesday in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he said .
rbs suspended two traders
the royal bank of scotland has two traders in its foreign exchange division , suspended two people who are familiar with the situation , which is further evidence that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market is rising fast .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , have confirmed that they have with the authorities in the investigation into the world &apos;s largest financial market , to work on a $ 5.3 trillion the owner .
the two traders would be the first rbs-mitarbeiter in the expanding investigation has been suspended , the scandal of the libor-interbankengeschäft .
the bank made no comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .
&quot; our investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulators , &quot; said the bank two weeks ago .
last month people close to the situation that the rbs the records of emails and instant messages , and sent to a former trader , the british regulatory body , the financial conduct authority , passed .
this trader , richard usher , had left the rbs in 2010 and is now at its current position as european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan impossible .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , leave this week and matt gardiner , formerly a senior currency trader at barclays and ubs , was suspended this week at standard chartered .
none of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing .
the instant message group of usher were bankers at barclays and citigroup , said people close to the situation .
ubs was announced this week that they have taken steps against some of its staff , after the swiss regulator finma had said that a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market on a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities around the world - the european commission , finma , the swiss regulator weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority - is currently dealing with allegations that bankers are agreed on the money market transactions .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also begun internal investigations or requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .
banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news about these investigations , the dealer in a field in turmoil , which has in recent years become one of the most profitable of the trading activities of investment banks , but this year under pressure , because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it was almost impossible , the extensive and highly liquid to manipulate foreign exchange market , leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true .
a leading retailer said that , despite the enormous daily trading volume in the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms run by banks that &quot; even with very low ticket-preisen can influence the market . &quot;
the news came on the same day , as credit suisse announced this week that it had a trader in its london exchange traded fund office terminated at the end of last year , after a loss of almost six million dollars .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and working with them .
&quot; we are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained , &quot; said credit suisse .

early puberty : grow up faster
african-american and hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age mates , studies show .
physical changes mean not directly puberty
there is no evidence that hormones and other chemicals are responsible
experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
the former cnn-korrespondentin pat etheridge is a journalist who has specialised in child health and family issues .
a mother should be concerned when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics pediatricians association this week in orlando , florida , said the paediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal under american girls and a new standard .
&quot; i spend a lot of time to reassure parents - usually there is no indication that quickly puberty occurs , &quot; explained kaplowitz .
obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , scham- and achselhaare and body odor , show up in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( first menstruation ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age for 12.5 years , slightly less than visual in 1970 .
&quot; if the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarche , &quot; said kaplowitz , author of the book &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to dealing with this often occurs . &quot;
time is the most accurate test , such as puberty .
it is controversial , which is actually the start of puberty , but &quot; precocious &quot; if the breast of a growth spurt before the age of eight years .
in most cases , the process is slowed down or stagnating - something that a doctor can monitor closely .
for faster progress could be displayed by a endikronologen tests , so that serious problems such as cysts or tumors can be excluded .
there are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : the early aging of the bones , the strong growth inhibition and small stature in adults .
the recommendations for a medication or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is sceptical about drugs , but he admits : &quot; the suppression of puberty can conduct problems and mitigate the feelings of girls , unlike their age mates . &quot;
the other major problem is understandable : parents would simply not that their very young daughters of the period .
&quot; they are concerned because of the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , &quot; said kaplowitz .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman whose daughter with ten of their days .
even if there were signs and we had spoken about menstruation , she was not prepared for it emotionally .
she was scared and excited home from school , because it was the first in her group of friends .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be eliminated .
young girls are similar to early puberty .
kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he was conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , which is a connection between body fat and entering puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
in this country tend to african-american and hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than their white age mates .
there are various explanations for this .
global seems an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions on the climate to the genes .
another mystery : although boys face and pubic hair grows earlier , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
other doctors on the aap-konferenz underscored the complexity of the issue .
the emergence of acne and pubic hair is even in infants and young children .
&quot; we have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to advice from their doctor , how they should talk with their child .
&quot; it may mean that you can carry on a conversation earlier than expected , &quot; advised kaplowitz .
if you remain calm , the child is usually good .
girls , early bloom , need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it happens earlier than expected .

and on the front of the grandstand blew lonely a large flag with the words &quot; section of the stadium ban . &quot;
just as goalkeeper roman pastures feller as bvb-spieler first entered the square , brandete short-lived jubilation .

what happens on the road with my email ?
e-mail is actually electronic letter .
the design of the internet service provider was e-mail , similar to the traditional post technically the privacy of correspondence .
in the design of the early internet was the focus , communication .
therefore , the basic technical protocols to ensure that a firm foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence .
it is a traditional mail a postcard rather than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; benni &quot; sends a mail , the host of the two then directly ?
the email client or the browser by anna schickt in the first step of the mail server of their service provider .
for example , if you have a gmail , the google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider , the benn .
on the track , the mail on other servers on the internet .
the content of the genre can then call their provider .
traditional emails read on their way through the net ?
most of the messages read several times by software robots .
the provider of the sender is usually checked whether the malicious email as an attachment .
on the receiver systems will also be a virus check .
also check the provider , whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam is deleted , or at least in a spam folder wegsortiert .
the robots have yet another task ?
on systems such as gmail , the robot and the information that google for placing context-advertising .
if anna and benn via gmail communicate on their next vacation , google may display links to holiday purchases .
also unknown people read the emails ?

in theory , but it is possible .
companies have often administrators the ability , electronic mail reading .
the law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies have the legal ability to intercept emails or to take note of that .
for possible illegal ausspäh-aktionen .
is it possible to protect against reading emails ?
with a key to the openpgp can an email effectively against viewing encrypted .
with high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of e-mail communication , so that no one can easily be detected , who communicated with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the mail market in germany ?

germany &apos;s biggest church has launched an offensive to the profession of the pastor .
the background is a possible priest shortage : the evangelisch-lutherische church hanover expects that the number of its roughly 1,800 pastor and pastors current situation will halve by 2030 .
for young people today is the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the press .
it is attractive , health and life itself .
with burfien has the will , for the first time , a pastor at a full point , young people for the bookseller .
currently , fewer and fewer young people decide after graduating from high school , to study theology .
burfien leads back to the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . &quot;
this is the work of great freedom and diversity .
i am mr my calendar and my priorities , where it is important to me .
pastors pastors may be close to the people .
they deserved as much as teachers and could live well .
in the free economy will certainly pay more , but for a secure employer theologians .
this brings the young people of today , which it is not just a career , but a meaningful work .
according to the church , which includes three quarters of lower saxony , currently around 60 pastors per year in retirement .
at the same time , about 40 students begin studying theology of their god .
in sparsely populated and peripheral regions such as the resin , the emsland or the wendland could find it difficult to future openings .
among other things , burfien wants to hold study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the bookseller offers a broad education .
you can even be president .
hearing before the royal commission : two ymca employee jonathan lord due before charges against accused of sex offences
two ymca-employees from new south wales ( nsw ) are for sex offences has been charged in connection with children before 2011 accusations against the childcare jonathan lord from caringbah , such as the royal commission for sexual abuse of children .
but the opening statement before the commission had the ymca stated that it was &quot; never in the organization with an incident of sexual abuse had to do . &quot;
director phillip hare was asked about a case in which a ymca employee indicted for crimes involving child pornography , and another in which a teacher of the ymca caringbah hall in 1991 because of the abuse he had been sentenced to deal with children .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission &apos;s assistance , a lawyer that he warned of the first case , the second but not before .
he acknowledged that the opening statement of the ymca in relation to the commission is also inaccurate in the claim , &quot; it was external reviews of the ymca , in which the ymca as at the forefront of child safety has been recognised . &quot;
evidence of the commission show that the ymca was informed that he was the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( 2002 ) in august of this year .
hare , with 21 at the ymca , admitted that the company had &quot; from me downwards &quot; in the recruitment of lord failed and not to ensure that employees are aware of their obligations and infringement of the directives on child safety .
lord was the beginning of the year because of sexual assaults against 12 boys during his two years of activity for the ymca .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
but hare denied that the ymca had a cultural problem , the employees have prevented from lords violations in relation to the safety of children .
the staff said that they had seen violations , among other things , that lord alone with children , she worked as a babysitter , she was sitting on his lap , said that he was delighted , and children play with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , whose boss lord and asked for a training on child protection , because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the children &apos;s services director jacqui barnat , the ymca caringbah , a lords was &quot; very intimidating and most of the time was very remote . &quot;
the manager said that he would not accept employees said that they had not dared to report to their superiors .
instead , he said , but their friendship with lord impair their judgment , which is why they have not spoken to him .
hare said that he was the executive board of the ymca nsw shared his view that the lesson that the organization &quot; jonathan-lord-zwischenfall , &quot; &quot; according to the report &quot; by staff , and the board voted in favour .
hare said that the decision , the staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations , is the managing director of children &apos;s services , liam whitley , the ymca .
he said that it should be to prevent contamination of the evidence , but &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw is the time when jonathan lord between 2009 and 2011 , there had been no children safe organisation , said professor stephen small bone of the griffith university , an expert on child sex abuse , the commission .
he explained that there are &quot; serious problems &quot; in hiring , screening , training , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing was postponed until december 20 .
tourism : descent to the romans
around 120 metres from a sewer below is from the roman era .
cologne , who visited the cathedral is not over .
some 157 metres , the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest building in europe .
but only a few visitors who visit the two ornate church spires , knowing that it was also under the cathedral is a lot of things to discover .
rainer schulze is an expert in cologne underworld .
meeting point for his tours is the service centre of köln-tourismus directly at the cathedral .
the tour starts quite unspectacular : &quot; we are in the garage , &quot; says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car fair city , and therefore of the remains of the ancient city walls only , which is not too large .
most users of the multi-storey car park today , therefore , come to the roman ruins and represent only their car .
but if you take a closer look , discovered in the parking deck d2 separated by metal iron bars archeological site .
to see about five metres high ruins from simple stones .
&quot; there are remains of roman wall in the second half of the first century after christ was built , &quot; says schulze .
before it goes back to light , schulze participants on the upper level is still a glimpse into a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .
this is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is scarcely noticed .
next stop of the tour is the prätorium , and here the participants get back down into the depths .
what we have here is the office of the once powerful man north of the alps , of the ccaa prätors .
what ccaa means a visitor would like to know .
&quot; the acronym stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara aggripinensium &apos; , which in plain english as much as &quot; town of roman law and city of agrippinenser , founded under emperor claudius in the place of the altar for the emperor &apos;s cult &quot; means . &quot;
and the prätorium is the former governors palace , the power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the foyer of the exhibition , a tunnel entrance to the roman sewer , here at around 120 metres .
&quot; you can calmly along the so-called cloaca maxima , if you want , &quot; encouraging schulze guests .
a surprise , schulze .
after he left the keys at the box office , the group he leads to a 16 meters deep , walk-in shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikvah , the ritual jewish bath , &quot; he says .
the jewish community built their bath deep in the soil , groundwater , which was essential for the ritual washing .
up to now , the lower end of the mikvah , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels by changing levels of the rhine .
the mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction work would begin soon .
but until a few years .

we are pleased to take this path , in partnership with land rover and opening the msa and believe that the format opens up new possibilities , the various rally-disziplinen in britain and abroad and newcomers to the hardships and the reality of rally raid .
we had a really fun to develop the defender challenge car - it will be an entertaining game .
in addition , there are the defender challenge a training and test in february , as well as the option to desert race in north africa and the middle east .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the choice
it &apos;s a new day , a new horror story to independence .
this time , we are warned that an independent scotland would be required to the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this provides the cue for stories about passport controls in berwick and secured with barbed wire along the border of hadrian &apos;s wall .
in fact , in the strathclyde-vorlage pointed to the potential economic benefits , the greater freedom of movement in the rest of europe , but it was - as expected - in the headlines .
also , nobody has mentioned that the eu member states often bent their strict rules , if it is cheaper for them .
as scotland is currently not in the schengen area , would be the continued disregard for brussels only a small concession in return for what you really want from the scots .
so , in fact , no story .
and one that has been so in the years to come is that it is already a fossil like : the first time i have the &quot; independence means &quot; -ente passport controls at least 40 years .
this is an interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient history .
why should we expect from an independent scotland that after the european pipe dances ?
why the london &apos;s yoke , against the trade from brussels , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the large , taken after the war plan for the unification of europe is faltering .
with the euro crisis , the european project is officially dead .
throughout the eu parties gaining ground , the eu-feindlich or the euro as a common currency would like to throw .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party , alternative for germany , founded this year - nearly five million votes in the general election in september and effectively for the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) from the bundestag .
there has been local opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis is a turning point .
because of the berlin and the european central bank has imposed strict austerity measures in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy by adhering to the single currency will be obliged , many people are of the opinion that the european project has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments can cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates , which are beneficial for german exporters - and the german politicians would like .
without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern europe with a built-in productivity in part to germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by berlin .
behind the current etat- and currency problems lies a more profound european productivity problem .
as a result of the imposed by brussels &quot; green &quot; energy directives - a code for the subsidy of french and german energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the european industry compared with the united states twice for electricity and four for gas .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen already in grangemouth .
all wage system in the world to protect the european petrochemical industry , of cheap us shale gas to be pushed into a corner .
as a result , a revolt , especially in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , the political elite of france saw the eu as a vehicle to germany and paris could stand on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin and paris is no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and europe has imposed its own economic policy , which the ailing french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , eu-feindlicher front national has just won a decisive choice and the ruling socialists at number three .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the british labour party , that they should not assume that a split on the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left .
what makes le pen with their newly won popularity among the white working class people ?
you would like to use the european elections next year , a anti-eu- , community currency bloc in the european parliament .
if the opposition parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible , then , for the first time , the european parliament is such a block .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the single currency is the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be something like the &quot; europe of sovereign nations , &quot; the general de gaulle .
germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect that britain distanced himself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the us .
however , washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific that britain alone in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide , a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests - including , berlin and brussels to say what they are where hinstecken .
i suspect that scotland could be a looser europe go quite well , as long as we keep our own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries , is not in a federal europe of nations easier .
otherwise , we should consider it norway and keep our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and won ) cuts made to the labour-finanzminister alistair darling and the subsequent tory-lib dem-koalition had to answer for .
it would be ridiculous for scotland , is now to decide on independence , only to then from berlin and brussels imposed austerity .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices on planes ( but no phone conversations )
passengers can now from departure to arrival their electronic devices to read , work , games , listening to music and watching movies , but not with the mobile phones , so the new directives on thursday from the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in the united states .
but passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately .
how quickly they were implemented , the respective airline , faa-mitarbeiter michael huerta said at a press conference .
the airlines must demonstrate to the faa that aircraft meet the new guidelines and training manuals for pilots and as well as the rules for the settling of the devices have updated according to the new rules .
the faa said it had already received from some airlines plans , the use of portable electronic devices on planes to develop .
under these airlines , including delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the state of the plan , we could have the expanded use of electronic devices allow very soon , &quot; the faa in a statement .
currently , passengers need to smartphones , tablets and other devices , when the doors are closed .
you may then start again , when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light .
when entering the final approach , passengers need to disable them and they are not allowed to start again , before the plane landed .
according to the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft against electronic malfunctions were secured to allow their passengers , the devices during take-off , landing and on the tarmac , the faa said .
most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of wi-fi in greater heights have been converted , should meet the criteria .
laura glading , president of the association of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new regulation will be implemented - and in this regard , we are working closely together with the airline , will benefit both sides , &quot; said glading .
we are tired of it , to be honest , we feel on this issue as a watchdog .
however , internet surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data at three kilometres , explained the authority .
passengers are asked to smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
still no &quot; words with friends , &quot; which recalls the scrabble online game , the actor alec baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he was a high profile of american airlines jet had to leave because he refused to turn off the device , while the plane was parked at the gate .
and heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed , because there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight is also still remain banned .
the regulatory competence for calls for the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not with the faa .
faa sets may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
last month , said mark rosenker of the transportation security administration national transportation safety board , security expert for national transport on cbs news , mobile phones are still regarded as a risk .
&quot; mobile is really a problem , not only because they potentially could cause disruptions in gps system , but because we know from the fcc that the transfer from the air also can interfere with radio masts , &quot; rosenker .
the industry an advisory committee , which the faa to investigate this issue was launched last month , recommended that the government to allow wider use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years has increased the pressure on the faa , restrictions on its use .
critics such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill from missouri , take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous .
in some studies , says that up to a third of the passengers of the closure of the unit forgotten or ignored .
the faa began in 1966 , the use of electronic devices by passengers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices of passengers ukw-radios agencies had become known , at the time , the latest technology trends .
new aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the faa that they represent anything electronic interference .
airlines offer passengers for a number of years ago , when the ground is achieved .
the wi-fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices will be suitable for the new directives , huerta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices , in general , much less phone radiation than previous generations .
for example , only minimal radiation if umblättert .
however , when downloading or sending data transfer values .
among the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on the use by passengers is amazon.com .
2011 invited employee airliner full of kindle rumours and made a test flight in order to identify problems , but could not say .
members of the faa-beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings about what the risk involved in the use of devices .
douglas kidd from the passenger association national association of airline passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa , the pilots to land in poor visibility conditions for instruments of the closure of units by the passengers .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes , describing it as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who extensively with technology today .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a passenger experience is not in contradiction with the security , &quot; said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .

jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of major orders up
between leading aircraft manufacturers , it is to be a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights , which set the tone for a bitter clash at the dubai airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the seat width , the passengers on long-haul flights in economy class is offered - not always those that most airlines , but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of allegations in the latest aircraft from airbus sas and boeing co .
airbus this week called for an industry standard , a minimum width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the economy , but the american competetive boeing says airlines should decide .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft are vying to even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft to sell , and the event from 17 to 21 november record orders .
as the rear part of the aircraft is fleshed out - especially if it ranks with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results , the new mini jumbo &quot; design to deliver .
boeing said that its new &quot; 777x &quot; shall be 406 people in economy class seats , which are about 17 inches wide and ten per series .
airbus said that the competing version of the a350 car 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class , and there are nine per series .
share aircraft giants often blows on technical details via advertising in the press .
now , airbus calls before the dubai airshow , where the 777x with over 100 orders is expected to make the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company unveiled an ad , which is the beginning of a new ad war could and donors a picture , in which three people squeezed in a restaurant , and the title : &quot; would you accept that ? &quot;
&quot; boeing is proposing long haul flights in seats that are more closely than regional turbo-props , &quot; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
in light of changed eating habits will people be thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % , so the data of the us-gesundheitsministeriums .
the taillenumfang of the male average american in the 21st century , according to us health statistics 100,8 cm .
airbus says that his rival to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of newly baptized &quot; jet set &quot; narrow .
we have , as airbus , investigations showed that an extra inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat by 53 percent raises the sleep quality .
boeing disputes the figures from airbus to the seat sizes and says that it is not up to the manufacturer to decide how the balance between airlines and air fares .
the company also said , according to surveys , the experience in the plane for more than the minimum width .
&quot; it is really to airlines to provide flexibility , so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful , &quot; explains the flight cabin expert kent craver of boeing .
you do not want to dictate to them what they are .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , it &apos;s about more elbow for manufacturers , but it is increasingly an issue that can impact on the sales .
the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars at catalogue prices in the coming decades , as heavily on the export performance of the united states or europe .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , is the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .
both airbus and boeing say 20 percent more efficient per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-sitzige boeing 77-300er .
the statements by boeing on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777x , with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; boeing squeezes more seats on his plane , in order to make our products more competitive , &quot; says kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort in the european airbus .
on the other hand , say analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers for closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares .
&quot; 18 inch seat width would be great for the passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus offer from the threat of the 777 controlled , &quot; says mary kirby , an expert on cabin no direction , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing have no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines .
the world travelers jet-verkäufer carry tape measure , the creation of the competition and gherkins .
even if they offer the comfort dressing , but all manufacturers also jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus offers a a350 with ten rows of seats , but has not as yet .
until recently , airbus has emphasised the importance of greater adaptability of cabins and some jets wide seats in the corridors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle , but from the wave of 777x-verkäufen could distract .
veganism is emerging as the vegetarianism , differs from this but in a very significant way .
for vegetarians , the consumption of cream cake , ice or a strong edam , they are not on the menu of a veganers .
milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegans from all the consumption of animal products - including honey is denied .
what , you may wonder , but on closer examination , the vegan nutrition world by a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; sandwich spreads are very popular , &quot; says ute henkel man , the owner of the local reform house , which has a variety of special products for vegans .
reuben london also visited the store in the domgasse .
for 13 years , the native new zealanders vegan lives in ( almost ) everything he finds what he needs to live . &quot; in 1997 , i was in my diet and vegetarian . &quot;
at the turn of the century , then took the next step and i was vegan .
&quot; the conviction but not only because of the food , but because of the shoe choice , &quot; says london , the artificial normal leather .
he acknowledged that there are also other everyday issues without animal products .
first and foremost , be vegan is an ethics .
&quot; i do not want that animals have to die for me , &quot; says protecting the maxim of vegans , who on the whole consumption .
instead of burgers , rühreiern or rubber bears mourn after , the vegans quickly discovered a completely new products , which increased enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says london today , &quot; be vegan actually represents a waiver , no prayer , but it is an asset . &quot; the assumption that the changes to the selection of dining options , london and more on the power of habit .
and these conditions also had some even well-intentioned attempt fail .
&quot; the addictive is a crucial factor that leaves many give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; scorched-earth is a comparison .
and : &quot; certain tastes are not depending on the animal . &quot;
often it is the spices or the type of preparation , which make up the taste .
&quot; but it is also in a different way to produce the same effect , &quot; says the vegans .
for example , at a barbecue , protecting such as aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages .
he takes on a balanced , varied diet , and taste the dishes .
of course , we would like to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but it is not only to reduce animal food , &quot; says london .
damage to health and eating disorders , another widespread adoption , he did not .
for me , the transition was a positive aspect .
i take no foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .
there are high performance athletes , which only vegan diet .
&quot; my blood values are well , i am often check , &quot; says proctor .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warn many vegansimus-kritiker .
&quot; as animals fed with feed , rather than on the pasture to graze , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer , vitamin-b12-anteil is high , &quot; scorched-earth takes place .
for vegans , there is also the possibility that the products in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12-werte are in order , &quot; he explains .
long distances should realize for the food supply .
finally , there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has now soya milk and other products .
everything i need , i think .
and i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that applies to &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products as well . &quot;
in any case , the preparation of our dishes are much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .
&quot; in the restaurant , there is a lot to discover , with a few small tips can be good , if not better results , in part , &quot; says london .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheesecake could realize his in-laws to delight .
strictly vegan gives a new condiment .
the dynamics when you cook together , has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise , are as diverse as the people themselves , &quot; says london .
he was , of course , but also scepticism prevails .
my food tastes you no longer ?
&quot; now i feel bad because i drink milk ? &quot; - the kind of questions you should act as vegans with sensitivity .
&quot; i reject the people do not , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor would not enclaves .
and then examined the everyday world is not vegan as suspects - and the vegan is not restricted in everyday life , as is commonly believed .
even fast food is allowed .
fries everywhere !
&quot; many döner delis , falafel , or a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says london .
he is in a pizzeria on pasta , or order a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slow .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago , i have to eat vegan , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the new zealanders can find a development : &quot; you talk to people , they point out . &quot;
&quot; if sufficient demand , perhaps they are inclined to complement the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegan restaurants are developing , such as the galley in mannheim or the café bird .
london has the desire that other restaurants at least a 08 dish on the menu .
basically , there are vegan dishes for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are precisely the opposite of exclusively .
&quot; meat are not exclusive , and in the truest sense of the word , because they are different , &quot; proctor .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way for the most part , to make impossible from the outset , &quot; says london .
but the purchase vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that color additives in animal farming donors may be included , it seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps the courage to leave .
not only have therefore reuben london and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives , &quot; explains the many ingredients , food and cleaning products are buried .
&quot; and we developed a scanner and know what signs and logos to respect you , &quot; it is sometimes better than small steps to stop or stumble , &quot; london .
veganism , he is an important moral signal that the awareness .
perhaps he is not quite that his habits , but at least he can teach consumers , his habits .
he &apos;s optimistic , despite the first defeat
even the first defeat in the euro league during the basketballern bayern munich not detract from the huge optimism .
&quot; no one can forbid us to believe , even against the best team in europe to win the last two years , &quot; said bayern-coach sveti lav pesic , following the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on thursday evening debuts at the expense of piraeus .
we have sent the message : even in munich is basketball .
in only her third appearance in europe &apos;s premier class , the munich sold very well for a long time , but in the crucial moments were simply not clear enough .
first , the guests managed the feat a 15-punkte-rückstand 13 minutes before the end to transform into a leadership , before the game , once again , a turning point .
&quot; we have incredible fought back against two-time euroleague-champion , but then again careless mistakes , &quot; said bayern-profi yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
malcolm delaney and nihad djedovic were the most successful shooter of munich in the first two games against the italian series champion monte paschi siena and the polish teams zielona góra significant victories .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine , which could spoil the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine in mice could protect against a lifetime of smoking .
in tests on humans are still needed further trials , which can last for a few years , but professor ronald crystal from weill cornell medical college in new york said that the first results are good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop all methods available in the market have tried , but had discovered that their smoking is stronger than these approaches , &quot; said cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so that the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .
the virus selective the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunting the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , causing a smoker no nicotine high .
in experiments were vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered to their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a break , &quot; the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine their brains .
the experiments , described in the journal science in translational medicine .
former tobacco out of vaccines , because it contained antibodies .
the vaccinations for maintaining the antikörperpegels had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , could be a future vaccine for people when he was quite sure children before they enter into temptation , to try a cigarette and tobacco addiction .
more likely , however , is that smokers would use it to stop .
&quot; you know , if they start smoking again , they feel because of the nicotine vaccine , no fun anymore , and this helps them to the habit , &quot; he explained .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is necessary .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot convinces with exceptional production facilities and contemporary details , but is also heavier fare than necessary .
in france the 1760er years playing action tells the poignant story of suzanne , a young nobleman who sent by her family in a monastery .

egypt &apos;s first freely elected president sworn in
mohamed morsi will be sworn in , but the triumph of the day may not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; as he became the first freely elected president of the country has been sworn in and the succession of latvian , the 16 months earlier had been driven out of office .
with his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world , and egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he presented the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes , the judges of the court , which has its headquarters on the nile and an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we aspire to a better tomorrow , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; morsi said at the ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said morsi , 60 years in the united states , a trained engineer and a member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its founding in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government sharply had been targeted .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building , as morsi shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car convoy arrived .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court , the new president zuzujubeln , and unlike the presidential pomp from the mubarak era , the traffic was stopped for a short time , so that the car convoy was able to cross the busy street in the city centre , with the southern suburbs .
as uncharismatisches &quot; spare &quot; the brotherhood derided his personal prestige since his victory and a friday speech , in which he not only as a candidate of the islamists , but all those who presented the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian mubarak to your destination .
&quot; egypt is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; said in a blue suit with a red tie morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber , in which he was sworn in .
later , morsi went to the university of cairo , where he should keep his inaugural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem , which he listened in habachtstellung .
the military &apos;s field was present .
on his arrival , he was of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university with a chant of &quot; the army and the people are one hand . &quot;
in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , university of cairo , built in the 1970s , has become a stronghold of islamist groups of students .
morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in the tahir-platz , the birthplace of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of mubarak , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers , by the turn of the head of state .
but with the passing of the official oath before the court and not , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is bowing to the wishes of the military , which shows that the power struggle will continue .
the speech at the tahir-platz was full of dramatic populist gestures .

frontier airlines charges for baggage
frontier airlines plans , up to 100 dollars from passengers who want to stow luggage on their flight .
frontier airlines intends , up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda , even if in the announcement on wednesday that passengers would keep the whole box .
the new charge will apply to bags in the overhead baggage compartment on the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
frontier said that establish 25 dollars , if the fee will be paid in advance , and $ 100 for passengers who pay at the gate .
frontier-sprecherin kate o &apos;malley said the fee of $ 100 is introducing travelers to move to the payment in advance .
&quot; we want to calculate this sum , &quot; she said .
airlines began in 2008 , for the first and second checked bag fees .
passengers who tried to bypass it , have therefore filled in your hand luggage as much as possible , with the result that the baggage compartments above the headquarters are often full to overflowing .
fees are a way to make passengers less on board .
o &apos;malley said the new fee is not really about money .
it was about the most loyal customers of frontier , which have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to place in the seat .
passengers carrying your tickets on the website of the airline , do not have to pay for it .
this means that a passenger at the gate of frontier may be allowed to carry one bag for free , but the next person 100 dollars on a comparable piece .
o &apos;malley said that the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers be informed about the fee before they come to the gate .
the new hand baggage fee of frontier will only come into force in the summer , a precise date , there are not .
rail passengers often on baggage fees and other charges , but airlines are like .
they argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service , if they wanted it .
many on wall street , the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines have enough money , after years of losses to cover the cost of air travel .
so far , however , most of them the finger of charges for hand luggage .
asked spirit airlines inc. three years ago , the first to charge for hand luggage , and later followed all the giant air , a low-cost carriers .
the only other airline with such a fee is the hungarian wizz air , said the airline consultant jay sorensen , who closely followed the charges .
he estimated in a report in december 2011 that the hand baggage fee spirit equals $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , who previously held a senior position at midwest airlines , has recently flown with spirit , and was curious as to what he would expect at the gate when passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee would be facing the company .
&quot; the boarding process was one of the most in my career , i have seen in the aviation industry , &quot; he said .
i expected , gnashing and of vehement debate at the gate .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and the boarding ran into problems . &quot;
frontier is spirit in the $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
the company said that passengers who bought soda or juice , would keep the whole tin and coffee refilled for free .
water is still free .
in 2008 , us airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but made it back seven months later , after passengers complained and no other big society was stroking .
frontiers step to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative , with the customer focused on their own website .
airlines pay for online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 dollars per ticket sold .
all of this gives companies an incentive for passengers to move directly to them rather than through an online travel agency .
however , in this area , frontier has gone furthest .
the company started in september , when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday , the miles again reduced to 25 percent of the flight .
in a third party booked a flight with frontier over 1000 miles , therefore only 250 miles .
passengers can also exclusively to the directly on the website of frontier reservation .
frontier has a loyal customer base with its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .
the proceeds were donated by 9 percent and the flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as the financial report , on wednesday of the parent company , republic airways holdings inc . , has been released .
republic has tried , within the framework of the sale of the company , the finances of frontier .

in a speech broadcast via video link on the open government conference in london , kerry said : &quot; there is no question but that the president and i and others in the government of some things that happened almost by autopilot , simply because the ability to do so , even in the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war and , of course , goes back to the events of 11 september . &quot;
then he acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the us government that the us-spionage crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights have been abused .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it is inappropriate to have gone too far . &quot;
the president is determined to create clarity , and therefore leads to a thorough investigation , so that no one must have the feeling that there is abuse .
i can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa is a force for good and its surveillance operations had been saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up . &quot;
there is a radical extremism in the world , which is determined to kill people , in the attack and governments .
so what would happen if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?
we have , in fact , plane crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we know in advance of such plans .
meanwhile , us lawmakers will travel to europe , to the concerns about the alleged us spying to disperse and the europeans of the need to convince the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the united states , as the chairman of the senate committee on european affairs , said on thursday .
senator chris murphy of connecticut , said he had this week with representatives of the european parliament and other people and was concerned about the threats , the frustration over the surveillance by the national security agency to anti-terror organizations .
&quot; it is very important for the national security interests of the united states , the europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board , &quot; said murphy , who is sitting as a democrat , for the first time in the senate and as chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations and european affairs , in an interview in washington .
furthermore , i am going to europe , in order to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the nsa-programme .
media reports that the nsa millions of telephone data in europe , relations with some us-verbündeten , although the head of the secret service this week said that the reports were unfounded and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by ally with the united states had been exchanged .
other revelations quoted from documents had passed , according to which the nsa the phone of chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other leaders around the world have monitored .
the director of national intelligence , james clapper , defended the spying on allies as necessary and explained that this was on both sides .
in all the uproar , murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the congress , which is due to take place this year , and hoped the delegation will members of both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members are to be released in the coming days .
he said the exact route will still be worked out .
while murphy pointed out , the purpose of the trip is to improve relations , he said , too , that there were some &quot; serious words . &quot;
he said that the european governments should be honest with the people about the type of spyware , which they themselves have used for years .
&quot; we can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of europeans , but they must also be satisfied with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , &quot; says murphy .
meanwhile , stands for john kerry over the weekend , a trip to the middle east and poland , with anger about the u.s. strategy in syria , egypt and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

clive palmer claims , prime minister tony abbott have conflict with parental leave
the billionaire and mp clive palmer says , prime minister tony abbott would be a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters pregnant and therefore could benefit from it .
the mining magnate , who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , challenged the assertion , as he was brushed aside questions about whether he is in conflict .
the palmer united party could be up to four votes in the senate , which are important for the decision as to whether the carbon and mining taxes will be cut or eliminated .
but palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of abbott personally would benefit from the legislation .
&quot; it is located in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not they will stay , &quot; said palmer .
two months after the election , the electoral commission said palmer ahead with 53 votes after the recount the winner of the sunshine-coast-sitzes of fairfax .
palmer called for a review of the process of counting to go faster .
tony abbotts daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections two months after the end of the vote ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why should we have a system in which you enter , the data into a computer , and then immediately is at 6 : 30 p.m. the result ?
palmer also criticised the use of pencils with marking the ballot .
they are used , because then you can wipe out the results , if they do not ?
with pencils to vote today is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined options for electronic voting and recently published a joint proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that his policy of an international airport for the sunshine coast was one of his new office and that he &quot; will take very seriously . &quot;
in a public post to the service to the public .
&quot; we strive for no reward out of the story , which is that we are at a critical time for this community , &quot; he said .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .
distant worlds .
more than 1,000 planets in other stars , astronomers have already been found .
whether there is life on at least some of them , nobody knows .
the selection is difficult : should we search for gravitational waves ?
or do you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos ?
or search for earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life ?
these questions are the leaders of the european space agency ( esa .
for its program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; looking for ideas for two major space projects , the research is crucial .
the budget for such &quot; l-missionen &quot; is about a billion euros .
the launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of september , met in paris , the elite of the european space research , in order to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them are now in the final round .
many bodies to examine the proposals , tick the researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision by the scientific program committee .
a total of four major issues has selected the esa , to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot; cosmic vision &quot; to find answers .
what are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
the exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit stars - are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
and if a star planet , under what circumstances can create life ?
to investigate this question , the space telescope in 2017 , &quot; unlike &quot; to start , with the 500 already known planetary systems in our area to be examined in detail .
but the opportunities are limited , khufu is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments astronomers could step planet and analyse the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases , as an indicator for biological activity .
how does the solar system ?
this question is , ultimately , what conditions for the emergence of life .
plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the star .
in our solar system are examples of these events .
the solar orbiter &quot; the esa is already a mission of the series ( this is where the budget at around half a billion euros ) for this question .
the probe is going to start in 2017 and finish and activity of the sun .
of great interest to researchers are also jupiter and its moons .
you want to find out what the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system .
this is the esa is the first of the three l-missionen of &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its journey to 2022 .
eight years later , she reached jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons europa and ganymede , wiser .
what are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid .
perhaps the physicists , the path to a new theory could indicate that comprises all known laws of nature .
what is the universe and what is it ?
in our universe 13.7 billion years from the big bang .
in addition to the daily material from which stars , planets and life as we are , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters , and dark energy , which is speeding up the expansion of the universe .
so far , the researchers do not know what physical laws in the first fractions of a valid from the big bang , nor what dark matter , dark energy .
with &quot; euclid , &quot; the esa also has already approved a m-mission , whose launch is scheduled for 2020 .
with a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , investigate and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make this race
of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection process , only two remain .
the best chance of a bewilligung as l-mission , according to many experts &quot; e-lisa , &quot; an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves .
physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time , the albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
it has not been proven .
elisa could hope to achieve this , the scientists behind the project .
the mission is one of two or three probes existing detector , which is deployed in space .
it could , in contrast to sites around the world , evidence of gravitational waves , which are the big bang , and new insights into the origin of the cosmos .
four other proposals still compete for the second l-mission : a large x-ray telescope named &quot; athena , &quot; which will explore , among other things , would investigate black holes , &quot; icy planets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; prism , &quot; a mission to survey the cosmic radiation , and the &quot; exoplanet finder , &quot; the first step is to identify and investigate the planet .
among other proposals are already resigned to proben-rücktransport from mars , for the study of the moon , venus and earth and the solar physics .
cdc allergic to publish guidelines for schools
published on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) is a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies among children in schools .
these are the first such directives issued by the us government , as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now has a food allergy .
the prevalence of food allergies among children , according to the cdc , between 1997 and 2007 increased by 18 percent .
the guidelines include information for schools , the faculty and staff to raise awareness about food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools have epinephrin stock - the injection of the brand epipen is most commonly used - a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the states have recently changed the rules , so that schools can keep stock epinephrin easier .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms of children who have an allergic reaction .
children may say : &quot; it feels as if something is on my tongue , &quot; &quot; my tongue feels as if a hair is better , &quot; or &quot; my tongue . &quot;
firefighters called to rescue a hündchens , 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous cliff was stranded in a quarry
cockerspaniel-hündin ruby was gone after a minor traffic accident
it was three days later by a walker in the quarry in their predicament discovered
firefighters seilten to rock and saved the dog before the safe death
firefighters managed to bring a puppy to safety on a 15 metre high margin was stranded on a cliff .

you are moving a muscle during their rescue - it was frozen stiff .
but now she is good .
then she has a couple of dogs ate cake .
this was a very unusual .
the fact that the dog was discovered , is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; ruby had a giant luck . &quot;
there was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse .
ruby was taken to a veterinarian for the investigation , but said nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : &quot; when watching the rescue was frightening . &quot;
i couldn &apos;t believe that it was really up there .
it was wonderful , she returned to the poor .
the vet said that if the exhaustion has become too big and they collapsed , they would probably crashed .
the firefighters did a great job .
it was very brave what they have done .

us : &quot; super tunnel &quot; discovered the drug smuggling
on the border between mexico and the united states , investigators have a &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling was discovered and shut down .
as the us customs , was the more than 500 metres long tube between tijuana and san diego with electricity , rail and a ventilation system .
three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana , and seized nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine .
the tunnel was reportedly has not yet been taken into use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid , if they think they could get under the radar by digging , &quot; said the general of us-distrikts southern california , laura duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in san diego , where one end of the tunnel was discovered .
the gangs assured duffy wrote : &quot; if you continue to build tunnels and tries to use them , we are determined to a huge waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the us and the mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 in mexico , more than 77 000 people killed in connection with the crime .
designed by experts
because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction of about a year .
the track layout was so that there could be used electrically powered cars .
on the mexican side is in a building that is 80 metres from the border .
according to authorities , a director of 20 meters in the depths of the tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 cm width .
he would also have been appropriate , in order to encourage illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the kokain-fund .
the third , a mexican , was taken because of the confiscated marijuana .
all three face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , officials said .
since 2006 , had eight such tunnels have been discovered , it was said at the press conference in san diego .
but it is the first time that such a construction of cocaine was found .
normally , cocaine in small quantities and not smuggled through tunnels .
this showed the &quot; desperation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said bill sherman of the drugs investigation dea in san diego .
they would do anything to get in the united states .
the detainees were given no details , at least one is mexicans , it said .
you must face up to ten years in prison .
obama &apos;s climbdown in health policy
after intense criticism , president obama yesterday backed down in his oft-repeated , clear promises : &quot; if you like your insurance , you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation , republicans cast the president in recent days that he had misled the american public .
yesterday , obama watered down his original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals obama called for those americans who have received such messages , on the open market for a new insurance .
the majority of citizens could be a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than anticipated .
&quot; you get a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population , who themselves have an insurance , should look for another rate , since the treaty does not meet the new standards after the affordable care act .
&quot; i would like to say directly to these americans : you deserve better , &quot; sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and commerce committee of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , the burden for the implementation of the act is responsible , said that the launch of the online platform since october &quot; abysmal &quot; pariah .
&quot; i am as frustrated and angry as anyone else , &quot; she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
this statement by an angry sebelius to sit behind her counselor at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives after a dispute with the republican legislators included billy long of missouri , whether they be obliged to participate in blood .
after more than three hours hearing hassled long sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care act will not voluntarily renounced a state-sponsored insurance in order to have a tariff at healthcare.gov , which it now wants to sell millions of americans .
parents of sexual children can choose &quot; gender undetermined . &quot;
germany is the first european nation , in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia .
newborn will no longer rigidly male or female .
under the new law , parents have no sex more for those children , but &quot; undecided &quot; or &quot; not fixed &quot; on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents , so that they do not make any hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns , and the people of sexual discrimination .
a internationell sexual person said , according to bbc years later : &quot; i am neither man nor woman . &quot;
i remain the mess that has been created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
an estimated one in 2,000 children each year , either as a boy or a girl .
they belong to the sexual , a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot; sexual differentiation disorder &quot; ( dsd ) , an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testes ) or unusually developed genital mutilation .
wallis simpson was perhaps the sexually .
the understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but the majority of experts in the united states , we should have the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible , and not on the psychological and physical development of children wait before you - if at all - for an operation to decide .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , on the issue of gender identification , said that the new german law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
inter sexual children are an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but for most children , this is not true , &quot; he said .
you can make a sex allocation without surgery and then wait and see how the identity of morality .
the scientific data on how a child &apos;s gender identity at all , are not very closely .
no one knows why it happens .
it is like the mystery of why people are gay .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says , sexual people are transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not sex , but by their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female exclusively , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .
these properties were subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structure and hormones .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination which inter sexual and transgender people face in the workplace and on the level of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .
not with the equality image matching boys now have a special camp .
it is now in australia and nepal for adults , on official documents male , female or &quot; third gender . &quot;
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) , the world &apos;s first &quot; loose &quot; person after a court recognised the lifelong maintaining a &quot; fixed &quot; gender status was granted .
german cards alongside m and w will have a third assignment , x for sexually , the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france gender issues are still controversial , as a news story on france 24 .
2011 signed dozens of french members of the strict catholic country a petition that the &apos; gender theory &quot; should be removed from textbooks .
the web site catholic online has also spoken against the german law , saying : &quot; if the world is being dragged into a new state , where sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two other pillars of civilisation . &quot;
the mother of a newborn in maryland told baby zone , they think it would be better if babies at birth is assigned to one gender .
&quot; the parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you are not the sex of your child knows , &quot; she said of the parents .
children need stability and security .
historically , the children were with both male and female sex parts were born , known as hermaphroditen , after the greek god of both sexes .
ten years ago , the medicine was the sex as something you could wipe out and then rebuild .
but in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation in doubt , now that we know how complex the gender identity , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child growing up with their assigned gender .
&quot; in the middle of the twentieth century , called this a &quot; psychiatric emergency , &quot; said drescher .
if such a child was born , then they called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals is dr. john money from the johns hopkins university , which is considered the sex .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives - such as the parents of a child educate-interacted with the genes and hormones and a child so as to whether a person is male or female .
but in the &quot; john / joan &quot; case from 1966 his theories have been controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision , to neuter the child and also to remove his testicles and then bring up as a girl .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but he was not , &quot; said drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married to a woman .
with 38 but he committed suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , are survivors of those sex operations to the public , &quot; not happy with the result . &quot;
such as jim bruce , a 36 year-old author from montana , who was born with xy-männlichen chromosomes , but ambiguous genitalia .
the doctors were not made clear whether he has a large clitoris or had a small penis and were convinced that he could never be a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
so its external body and shortly after birth the testicles surgically removed in 1976 , and he was brought up as a girl .
at the age of 12 , he was awarded female hormones .
&quot; i knew that i am not a girl , &quot; he said on abcnews.com
i was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he should receive a vaginoplasty .
but because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found was shocking .
i was at my birth sterile - and nobody has ever said to me .
bruce was born with a dsd , through his body not enough testosterone to the development of the genitals could produce .
after he had learned the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosteron-injektionen and was to remove his breasts .
the operation , he has become infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organisation called interface project that inter sexual people perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , director of rights group based in california advocates for informed choice , is concerned that the german law &quot; for stamping and encourage basque . &quot;
&quot; many activists are worried that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child , not to &quot; set , &quot; she said .
we fear that favours intervention .
we think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait and see .
but we still do not know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that their organisation to support the australian law , because &quot; it allows adults recognition as a third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex to meet , &quot; she said .
the german law relates to the allocation of childbirth .
this is not a fight that small children should force at this time .
when they grow up , they themselves can decide on their bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz , a breast radio login from pitt , a daughter with a sexual differentiation disruption , and hundreds of others in a support group , says that the german law &quot; authorize &quot; both parents and children .
baratz &apos;s daughter katie , who was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgenresistenz .
because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and ovaries .
this is katie 29 and married ; she works at the university of pennsylvania as a researcher in child psychiatry .
while it is barren , hopes , however , through the adoption of a child or a surrogate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , where they don &apos;t have to make decisions in haste , &quot; baratz said .
it gives them the time , various tests and to clarify things and gives them time , before they &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; writing .
in this way , everything is in order , the child and loves it .
we have a wonderful baby and the parents .
and we must not rush to carry out an operation that can no longer be undone .
&quot; that includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are concerned , because they believe that they would not do the right thing , &quot; she explained .
finally , the child decides on the sex , the more suitable for him - and this is wonderful .
this will enable children to take the decision itself .
excellent mastered the fight
the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway &apos;s novel &quot; the old man and the sea , &quot; horst janson cut on the body .
janson is an old hand in his profession , the acting .
the old man santiago can fool no fishing .
the two complement each other .
you would think that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of which the fishermen young manolo , .
if santiago bowed to tired of life sitting on the chair is the janson .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman and a character role that janson excellently .
hemingway told the story of a warrior , a brave man who doesn &apos;t give up and , ultimately , by its knowledge and its will to win the fight against the fish .
janson is in many respects the only actors on the stage .
he manages to get the attention of the audience to focus on , so that his monologues are not boring .
his efforts , the fish to the surface of the water , so real that the viewer forget that the sea but only bottled water from blue lights .
director jens hassel man makes the old man in the boat before the fishing village .
in the course of the show , he is the active scene into the light : the hut of santiago , bar the singer marie-luise , with their songs and their beautiful voice sings the attitudes of cuba .
the four musicians playing rhythm to cuba and guests of the bar .
fancy ice cream , which glows in the dark ?
a british businessman has the first glow in the dark ice - with the help of jellyfish .
charlie francis , the fluorescent properties of marine life and created a luminous infinity .
the idea came to him after he had read a research study on jellyfish and chinese scientists could convince the protein artificially .
the ice cream eating reacts with the tongue , thus raising the ph of the protein and the lights .
chris said , the ice cream would agree to the heat in the mouth and lights - the more you licks , the brighter it will .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious , &quot; says : &quot; the product is unbelievable , but it is still at a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams for 200 pounds . &quot;
the ice cream protein reacts with the tongue in a neutral ph .
if the mouth of the protein , the ph and the ice .
we have tested it in the last few months , and it seemed to us to be perfect , on halloween , because it has this wonderful leuchteffekt .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream , which i have ever produced , because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball cost me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious .
char read experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .
but his latest creation should be more ambitious .
he says : &quot; i would like to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
this is impossible because of the atmosphere , which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream , but i suspect that we will find a way to create it .
the ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a jellyfish , which are manufactured by chinese scientists artificially
salem : johanna rahner the ecumenical forum
the next world forum on monday , october 21 , at the new museum of the castle is the subject of &quot; to hell with the hell theological reflections on today &apos;s handling of the last things . &quot;
she is professor johanna rahner .

the disposable society does not think
the night was long , the music was loud and the mood is good , but at some point , it is home .
only : in the bellies of the people on the front and back , the hunger .
clearly , this may be the one or other cocktail or champagne to be responsible .
what is more , when chilled to the nearest drive-in , in order to take a bite ?
i admit that i am happy with it , if it is late at night or early in the morning to get fast food .
a couple of french fries and a coke , burger - and by home and go to bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-gängern .
because what must be a constant regularity that its fast-food bags out of the car window ? !
especially at the weekends are discarded paper in urban areas and parking lots .
&quot; why ? , &quot; i wonder .
the people are too stupid to the bags home or until the next bin ?
it is not only that the paper stuff disfigured the landscape .
bags have already covered transport facilities such as crash barriers and caused by accidents .
so what does the &quot; disposable society &quot; but not , presumably , they do not even know what the word means .
if you travel more often in the evenings , especially with several people in the car , you know , as a back seat after celebrating nights : clothes , bottles and other rubbish are there .
there are a couple of bags , more or less , but nothing - in contrast to the street , where none of the other rumtrampeln pigswill .
i can see the day will come when the removal of the cities and municipalities to stupid - and the fast food chains for their bags must demand deposit .
milk and ei-alternativen at a glance
vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
pürierter tofu with cream , for example , is a replacement .
further , the vegetarierbund to weltvegantag on 1 november .
the vegetarierbund germany proposes to mark world vegan day on november 1 , a series of vegan alternatives :
pure flora margarine is a good alternative to butter , yogurt have replaced with soya yogurt .
could instead of milk , soy , almond , or rice milk .
surcharge face plants replace conventional whipped cream .
there are also eiern herbal alternatives .
half a crushed , ripe banana , for example , can be an egg as binders in a cake .
50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are in favour .
instead of loosening pastas with egg , for example , with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder , a tablespoon of starch and three esslöffeln mineral water .
but even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose .
according to the vebu feed in germany around 800 000 people vegan , animal-free .
a black box in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to the decaying highway system repair , and believe the solution in a small black box to the dashboard of the car .
the devices , which each mileage record and report the information to the authorities , are at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the agencies of the federal states , the outdated system for financing american roads .
the normally rather boring field of road planning suddenly has an intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertarian have allied with environmental groups and support for the government of the small boxes for recording the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax modest .
the tea party is horrified .
the american civil liberties association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection issues .
but while in congress could not agree on an approach , several states wait no longer .
you are currently examining how it over the next ten years to move to a system in which drivers pay per mile travelled .
thousands of drivers have a tachograph , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring , have already been tested .
this really is a must for our country .
&quot; there is nothing that we may use only , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the southern california assn. of governments , which is a record of driving miles on all california motorists in the state in 2025 .
the way in which we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is financed from taxation , the americans pay at the pump , broke .
but in america will no longer needs as much as before .
cars that consume less fuel .
the state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased in 20 years .
politicians do not dare to high fuel prices , the tax by a penny .
&quot; the economy is simply not sustainable , &quot; says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently 500 cars equipped with a black box , with which a miles based payment system to be tested .
&quot; this is the best option in the long term , &quot; he said .
bureaucrats call it miles based user fee .
it is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , the way to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases .
the californian designers rely on the system for the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious , legally binding objectives of the state of climate change are to be achieved .
but the republican bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketer of the reason foundation are fond of the idea , drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route .
&quot; this is not a tax , which disappear into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president for policy at the reason .
the people directly pay for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former american ministers who , in a report in 2011 had urged congress to move towards miles based billing .
last year , the senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project , which includes 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives hindered the thrust and thereby responded to the concerns of members from rural areas represent the people who , on a daily basis , often many miles on the way to work or have to travel into the city .
several states and cities move nonetheless , on his own initiative in this direction .
the most active forum is oregon , which currently 5,000 driver for the country &apos;s largest experiment being recruited .
this will soon be the mileage fees instead of paying tax to the state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city also is considering such a .
it is testing ziibi limited with trucks .
and the i-95-koalition , the departments of 17 states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices , motorists were sceptical of the idea that the government could track their movements .
&quot; concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , &quot; explains alauddin khan , head of strategy and product management at the department of transportation of nevada .
people wanted to do it .
when the trial started , warned the aclu of nevada on their website : &quot; it would be relatively easy , the tachograph to turn adult monitoring devices . &quot;
there is no need for a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used , data on the daily movements of individuals .
nevada is one of a number of states , which are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can collect the mileage , but not exactly when and where .
so , as khan , would also be confident the public .
the pursuit of this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called true mileage in california .
the company is not originally for states in the field of taxation on motorists to help .
rather , it was their aim , in an emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers pay based on miles driven .
but the devices are tested for the road planners are interesting because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information regularly via modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and location not be recorded , &quot; said ryan morrison , ceo of true mileage .
in some of these public pilot programmes were made big mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it .
in oregon , the planners that motorists are experimenting with a number of choices .
you can opt for a device with or without gps .
or they take absolutely no device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles .
others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public to equip devices with more functions than with little .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a device for taxation , which is also pay parking , insurance only for driving distances must be paid and speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams .
&quot; motorists with the added value of the benefits the system offers , motivated to participate , &quot; says a planning document of the city .
some traffic planners wonder , however , whether all the talk about the pay per mile is not just a huge red herring .
the metropolitan transportation commission on the territory of the san francisco bay , officials said , congress , the problem of the bankrupt highway trust fund simply by increasing the tax on fuel .
an additional fee or an annual tax could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less fuel , so that they pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no reason for an operation , but is also an aspirin , &quot; said randy rentschler , the head of the commission &apos;s legislative and public affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy , and many other things .

specific plans were recorded two years ago , when the fc the schabelstube took over in a charge of eur 100 000 for the construction of the tram and the country approved subsidies from 104 000 euros .
the council decided in october 2012 , the acquisition of the remaining 6 000 euros of the total cost of 560 000 euros , klumpp took together .

security concerns grow in mozambique because of clashes between influential personalities
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder and first president of mozambique , in a rare public demonstration commemorating the call for peace .
&quot; we want peace , we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fear for the future of the country , it has its business attire for a t-shirt with the inscription &quot; we demand security &quot; traded in portuguese , and on thursday the crowd in independence square in the capital .
for two weeks , there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , which is one of the worst battles since the peace agreement , over 20 years ago .
it was once a notorious rebel movement renamo , which was initially ruled from white rhodesia , and later the apartheid government of south africa , in an effort to support the independent government to destabilise the country .
after the peace agreement of 1992 , it has become an opposition party .
analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict back the case , but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals .
for the rapidly growing economy is a lot at stake , since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years , could investment of over 50 billion dollars from companies such as rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko of the us into the country .
the ruling frelimo-partei , the dominant force since 1975 , and renamo are blaming each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government had provoked the recent clashes , on october 17 , by its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos , attacked .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked renamo-stützpunkte and tried to kill , afonso dhlakama , leader of the group , said renamos spokesman to the financial times .
the government is renamo blamed for the clashes and accuses the organization , soldiers attacked .
president armando guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .
with afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhlakama regard themselves as &quot; losers &quot; who &quot; all his remaining forces , in order to prove that he can impose on the government &apos;s decisions . &quot;
both frelimo and renamo to stress that they want to avoid a war .
but the concerns have increased since mazanga was quoted as saying that the peace agreement of 1992 renamo .
compared to the ft , he said that he had said that the agreement was no longer frelimo .
&quot; our vision is to resume negotiations and it seriously , &quot; said mazanga .
previous talks between the parties have not helped to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year have been fired .
&quot; here we have two adult men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , who heads collide , &quot; says joseph &apos;hanlon , a lecturer at the open university and mosambik-experte .
none of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , which is pushing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will boycott the elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement interpreted , concessions and financial benefits from the government .
shrink renamos electoral success since 1992 , during a recent party , which was founded by a former renamo-mitglied movimento respectively de moçambique ( mdm ) , is likely to improve in the elections .
mazanga said that guebuza - whose resignation when his second term ends next year , the democracy of the country .
&quot; he does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want a transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , &quot; says mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo , but it has been disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links .
most of the fighting took place in the province of sofala , a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , beira , however , the port , the mining companies like rio tinto and vale for the export of coal .
in june , rio a month suspended the use of the railways after renamo is an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo will repeat that threat .
&quot; renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in mozambique , &quot; said mazanga .
the instability have increased frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of media coop , an independent media company , because many people were already due to corruption and the slow progress in the development and a recent kidnapping wave .
&quot; people think that the government and the president for the future of the country and he should be , the solutions to the problems , &quot; he says .
omar sultans , a demonstrator , said , the people just wanted stability .
&quot; no wonder renamo and frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , &quot; he said .

earlier , a spokesman for the nsa to abc news said that the sensitive internal network of the authority was &quot; in no way compromised . &quot;
secret information were not at risk , according to the spokesman .
at least one group , said that the nsa-website paralysed with a ddos attack .
in such attacks , the target website with sites flooded , until the server overload and the site will collapse .
the cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not the target in the internal network .
the super secret nsa , whose nickname was once no search agency ( no such authority ) that is now in the bright light of the public and , according to the announced in recent months , revelations about her extensive monitoring severe criticism at home and abroad - a result of the secret from disaffected former nsa-mitarbeiter had been stolen and published .
the growing controversy surrounding the secret service radiate initial speculation about the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .

the former us expert reasserting the us-spähaffäre could also make statements in his russian asylum .
representatives of the federal general prosecutor could ask either in writing or the 30-jährigen personally in russia .

such a question could be resolved on an intergovernmental basis , it said .

children should myths and legends as &quot; role models for life &quot; teach , says the author .
the stories of thor showed that &quot; brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , &quot; and the arthur demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
however , many of the myths are &quot; far too wild , offensive and , in some cases , dirty , in order to be taught in schools , &quot; why crossley-holland for a &quot; careful selection &quot; age works .
&quot; i think it is wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i have already proposed a plan for twenty years .
he added , with authors and teachers who are &quot; overly didactic , &quot; &quot; children would &quot; shut down completely , &quot; because in entertaining stories , the messages &quot; subliminal .
crossley-holland , translated from the anglo-saxon poem , and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales , said : &quot; you can pursue certain intentions , but it should be possible to keep in the background . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults , and an author who writes for children , is the need to give hope .
not everything needs to be simplified and the happy ending , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .
this must be presented subliminally through the history and not be revealed .
it is the old story of the showing rather than telling .
they thought , thanks to internet travel agencies are a thing of the past ?

already exceed the revenue from stamp duty on residential property in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , in the tax year 2012 / 13 from £ 708 million , the proceeds for northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north east , north west , yorkshire and the humber region together .
cook said : &quot; the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the legislation against populations , it is difficult to maintain that high quality properties are taxed too low , despite the impact of the outdated local taxation system . &quot;
&quot; but this step could make some foreign investors cautious with regard to the purchase of real estate in london , or prevent owners to sell , &quot; he added .
prime property - the top five to ten percent of the housing market to price in the wealthy london south west belt , which stretches from fulham and wimbledon , the record of 11.8 % in the last year , more expensive .
prices in central london had a steady annual growth of 5.6 % , but were of a &quot; domestic &quot; overshadowed , on the south-western part of the city , to the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to a survey by savills .
even if the sg achim / baden since four matches without victory , the fourth hand still good mood .
this coach tomasz malmon absolutely no doubt .
all are still fully motivated .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i know no longer tastes like a victory , &quot; malmon is a success of his team vfl fredenbeck ii .
even if the drittliga-reserve from fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted , malmon warning in advance of the finger .
i have many players still in the a-youth .
therefore , they are certainly against their former coach will be especially motivated .
&quot; it is also to be seen whether there is strength from the first , &quot; explains the sg-coach .
to finally get back on the road to success , the malmon-team compared to previous appearances in any case .
above all , in the cover and shift game after it suffered huge .
the chances of recovery must definitely be better .
therefore , i hope that my players during the short break free of the head .

report : obama campaign , biden to replace by hillary clinton
the closest adviser of president barack obama have deliberated in secret , vice president joe biden in the 2012 campaign to replace by hillary clinton , the new york times .
the revelation is the surprise of the long-awaited work by mark feelings and john heilemann on the 2012 campaign , &quot; double down : game change 2012 . &quot;
the times received a copy of the book , published shortly before and she reported on thursday evening that the president &quot; topberater extensive breakout sessions and surveys carried out by the end of 2011 &quot; had to find out whether it is obama &apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election turned out better , if biden fall .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent for the times , the book is a thorough history of the efforts of senior officials of the campaign and the white house , notably the former white house chief of staff bill daley , to measure the effect it had on the poll , the former secretary of state clinton against the vice-presidents .
the potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and in the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisors - including daley , obama &apos;s former campaign manager , jim messina , the former senior adviser to the white house , david axelrod and david plouffe - knew about the planned change .
in &quot; double down &quot; claims , daley was at the forefront of the effort , biden despite her &quot; close , personal relationship &quot; exchange , before finally decided against such a move , after the data showed that clinton &apos;s candidacy &quot; the chances obama would not improve significantly . &quot;
in an interview with martin daley confirmed that the government is considering to replace biden by clinton .
&quot; i made a whole series of things that we should consider , and this was one of them , &quot; daley told the magazine .
it must be remembered that the president had terrible poll at the time , so we thought : &apos; for god &apos;s sake , what are we doing ? &quot;
while daley the investigations as a &quot; due diligence , &quot; said martin to anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move is on the ballot box auszahle .
&quot; in campaigns is not so much money spent on surveys and focus groups , if we do not seriously thinking about something , &quot; said martin on ac360 .
however , it is not clear whether obama knew that his team on an exchange .
martin said on cnn that he had daley asked whether his former boss on the potential change knowledge .
although daley said that he does not believe that the president was aware of the possible change &apos; , &quot; the former chief of staff , it was &quot; possible &quot; that obama was aware of them .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; no definitive answer to the question of whether the artificial political soundings had reached obama &apos;s desk .
cooper asked martin if he seriously think obama knew nothing of the investigation about whether biden should fall in the elections .
&quot; possible , &quot; said martin .
local councillor appreciates sound budget
whenever it at city council meetings on the budget , mayor ralph gerster good laugh .
the gemeindesäckl in herdwangen-schönach is well stocked and debt knows the administration since 2005 .
the year 2012 can be booked as an unqualified success .
this was during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andrea roth mouth explained , is the administrative budget , with about 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget bed with some 1.8 million euros , roughly a million euros on the approach .
thanks to the surplus is mainly higher commercial tax revenue and the share of income tax .
the capital budget was clear about the planned values .
instead of the proposed eur 1.5 million last year , it was eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is largely due to the higher feed from the administrative budget , &quot; says roth .
as for the financial year 2012 less than planned investments have been made , the reserve is also feeding higher .
overall , the general reserve of around eur 2.1 million to eur 4.9 million in total .
mayor ralph gerster thanked roth mouth and her team for their excellent work .
&quot; it is not easy to shake a work from the sleeves , &quot; praised gerster , with a view to the financial statements .
he and the local councillors were visibly on the positive figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures could soon the citizens dearly .
the financial situation of the community in the past at high rates .
this , in turn , but according to gerster were often grants have been cut from the country .
for these grants from various balancing poles , there are conditions .
among other things , the cities and municipalities , applying for grants , certain rates .
&quot; the issue we need to look at rates , because investment in the coming years , for which we would like to support , &quot; announced gerster in this context .

a cry of despair obama-wählers
i have twice elected president obama in the hope that change is possible
he says that obama has the laudable efforts of the blocking tactics by republicans had been thwarted
the policy does not apologise website-probleme of blood , the drone attacks
obama &apos;s memoir on the election campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at harvard medical school .
i read a terribly sad book .
it is a book of which i have believed that it would be sad to me during the second year of my medical degree wit and give me hope .
it is called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( courage ) and depicts the memoirs of barack obama in the 2008 presidential election .
in the evening , when i finished with my patients record and go to bed , then this book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and speeches will take your breath away .
the election was a landslide and for adults , spokesman for the historic importance of this moment .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers .
a young team of visionaries was on her way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama went into office in 2008 , he had approval values of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a rude awakening , as if from a dream .
it is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i made my voice for the first time , really has changed .
but it &apos;s just not what i imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things that obama has achieved by the adoption of the burden for health insurance until the military withdrawal from iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of osama bin laden .
i , too , am of the opinion that the political block too many efforts have overturned , with which our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of guantanamo bay , to name just a few .
but after countless times the obama administration to colleagues and friends , i am trying my statement at the end .
i have reached a point of political desperation .
the republican blocking tactics cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
it does not explain why the national security agency data about the private lives of americans collect and why whistleblowers should be punished , disclose wrongdoing .
it does not explain why anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , was killed without trial , nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the findings of a report , which states that the efforts of the white house to keep the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and did it cannot excuse the failure , in the more than three years since the passage of the affordable care act to create a simple web site .
i do not know whether this is what i would have expected .
if i had to understand that the government of the previous political campaigns could disagree .
obviously , the abgeordnetenamt no predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the newtown-massaker shape the public debate .
but when i look at the above examples , then they seem largely by the government itself to be elected .
and that bothers me the most .
i have chosen obama again in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative , he seemed to define its direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long .
but with a decline in the ratings for obama to below 45 % this week is a return to 2008 through this book to become even harder .
it makes me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air .
this week i read a section in the book , which describes how obama a heavy loss against clinton in the primaries in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision , he told his staff , they have to come back on track and the purpose of their cause .
&quot; i want us to find the magic , &quot; he said .
we have to remember who we are .
there are five years later , mr. president , and i could not agree with you more .
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of nathaniel morris .

the theater , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically inspired novel &quot; the serf &quot; ( 1987 ) with prose miniatures from &quot; corpse , his family belauernd &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely emptied stage - important requisit : a zerknautschtes sofa , in the slightest - hangelt kopuliert and masturbating , the eight-member ensemble through the texts .
it seems the director fresacher little trust .
the 70-minütige performance papered over the template with a wealth of stage invasions , known from the repertoire post dramatic forms .
above all , the actresses in the sometimes rather dubious scenic implementations .
you will be dealt with harshly , with his head under water , with its evening getackert robes on the wall .
sandwiched in cellophane or corsetry , staksen to dangerously high heels by the staging , either monologisieren they blatantly or are completely silent on the stage floor .
the text gives to the hard way .
the best moments of the evening , when singing - the spectrum ranges from deep purple to volkstümlichem songs .
only towards the end of the performance was turned over to rest , and winkler &apos;s almost absurd humor evokes .
