schools are encouraged to a greater focus on math , spelling and grammar
in courses in english literature , pupils must deal with at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic poetry and contemporary british novels from 1914 in the future .
&quot; you text &quot; entrance to encourage broader reading also found in the audit .
the combined rate of english literature and language will be abolished .
from 2015 , pupils must file a separate gcse examination for language , and there are strong incentives for choosing english literature as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education , tomorrow will publish the new curriculum for english and maths - the first subjects that have been radically transformed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , ofqual , the exams regulator , announce a reorganization of the gcse structures , including a new tracking system and less course work .
education secretary michael gove said in a speech in the summer , that there is a &quot; broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; he said that gcses would be &quot; challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathematics - 116 hours per year , or three hours per week per school year - than in most other countries .
on the other hand , australian schools teach received an average of 143 hours per year and students in singapore 138 hours .
although there will be no formal request , to provide for more time for mathematics in the curriculum , but states from coalition circles , the comprehensive math test , combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in ranking , will probably encourage schools , more hours .
the curriculum will put more emphasis on &quot; real life problems &quot; including financial mathematics .

in the house
i was asked to write to you for your examination of mass surveillance .
my name is edward joseph snowden and was once a contract or through a direct employment as a technical expert at the national security agency ( nsa ) , employed by the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and the defense intelligence agency ( dia ) of the united states .
in the course of my employment in these facilities , i was witness systematic violations of the law of my government that led me from moral duty to act .
as a result of the publication of these concerns i saw i face a serious and persistent smear campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live now in exile and enjoy temporary asylum , which gives me the russian federation in accordance with international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
people around the world , as well as high officials , including the united states , the revelations have judged on a system of mass surveillance , which is accountable to no one , as a service to the public .
the espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the former covert abuse of public trust .
the benefit for the company gained from these findings is increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks taken in purchase were visibly reduced .
although the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive , treated my government dissent remains as a loyalty break and seeks to criminalize political expression and to put on trial .
however , the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that , with the support of the international community , the government of the united states will give this damaging attitude .
i hope that , if the problems are resolved of this humanitarian situation , i will be able to focus on the good awareness of the issues in terms of the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports , appropriate and to take part in accordance with law .
i look forward to a conversation with you in your country , once the situation is clarified and thank you for their efforts to maintain international law that protects us all .

on the way through mud , rivers and jungle for free medical care
dr. georges bwelle brings free medical care in remote villages in cameroon
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
there are not many doctors in the west african country , only one in 5,000 people
vote here or with your mobile device from
dr. georges bwelle &quot; is one of the top 10 cnn heroes of 2013 . &quot;
you can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 , in order to elect him to &quot; cnn hero of the year &quot; .
the winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years looked at georges bwelle with , as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals , which do not have the means at their disposal to help him .
jamef bwelle was injured in a car accident near yaoundé , the capital of cameroon , in 1981 .
first he had a broken arm , but then formed an inflammation , which is expanding on his brain and caused a hämatom there that should affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there was no neuro-surgeon in cameroon , &quot; said georges bwelle .
if we had the money , we would have released him from cameroon .
instead spent bwelle years in order to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals , in order to get the treatment , which they had to offer .
&quot; it is not easy , &quot; bwelle commented .
you can leave the house at five o &apos;clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and it is not first .
there are a great many patients .
indeed , some people die because they have to wait .
the situation has changed little since bwelles &apos;s father died in 2002 .
there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in cameroon , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the ratio in the united states lies with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most cameroonians could not afford the visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .
&quot; the only problem they have is the poverty , &quot; says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and to see so many of his compatriots are suffering caused in bwelle mature the decision to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his voluntary team have carried out 700 free operations last year .
he was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
in addition , he founded a non-profit organization called asco vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and offering free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday force he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof on unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help .
not always , everything runs smoothly .
more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be greeted as heroes : a feast , singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
free medical care is really a cause for celebration in these villages and bwelle , with his broad smile and his boundless energy , is to present at the joyful celebration .
the next morning the team then begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients .
&quot; we treat 500 people per trip , &quot; so bwelle .
they come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
other given crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates , a document that is required for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , leads the team from simple operations with local anaesthetic .
the operations are usually held in a school , the town hall or a flat ; after the procedure , the patient on and go in the recreation area , in order to make room for the next person .
the lighting for the op and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and so bwelle and his volunteer work until the early hours on sunday .
it is an arduous amount , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
&quot; they drum throughout the night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday , the team then back in the city , tired but proud of the work he has done .
the group - a mixture of cameroon doctors and medical students abroad - has 700 free operations last year and know that it makes a huge difference for people with their work , which helps them .
a man explained that the free operation of a side raec mons , which he received , he will now have to work again .
&quot; it changed the future of my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works bwelle even at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job by 60 % of his charitable activity , so bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
&quot; i really do not know when he sleeps , &quot; katie o &apos;malley says that in the second year at drexel university in philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in bwelles group participates .
he is always either in the hospital or tried to raise money for the organization , so that he can go to these campaigns .
as o &apos;malley for medical and nursing students who come from the united states and europe and bwelle support , this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
&quot; we can be in operations , where we help keep blood abzutupfen or the instruments for dr. bwelle , &quot; o &apos;malley said .
that would never be possible in america as a medical student in the second year .
the students pay their trip to cameroon normally itself and bring often donated medical equipment .
they are , however , only once in yaoundé , bwelle assumes the accommodation , transportation and guide .
&quot; he is without a doubt a hero , &quot; says o &apos;malley .
he devotes his life of this organisation and his desire to help the people in cameroon , knows no bounds .
the almost constant work is no burden for bwelle .
to help others to a more fortunate life and to fulfill a promise that he has given his father , gives him great pleasure .
&quot; i am so happy when i make this work , &quot; says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it , in order to bring people back to the laughter and to relieve the pain .

pope francis appoints in february first cardinals
pope francis will rely on february 22 new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the senior clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are also to elect a pope , francis is to appoint the first group of men who will participate in the election of his successor at the end of the day .
currently , there are 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal , who has reached the age of 80 years , can no longer take part in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 &quot; electorate &quot; cardinals .
in a statement , in which the news was announced , father federico lombardi , a vatican spokesman said , there will be a meeting of cardinals , before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals , which is also known as a consistory .
&quot; pope francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the by last february in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of the cardinals from around the world can be planned , &quot; lombardi said .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of cardinals eligible voters will probably be dropped until february .
he said that a pope appointing normally so many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of voters scared again 120 amount , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he would like .
the consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of francis in march of this year , as valero .
at the moment there is some overhang on the part of europe , and in particular in italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of catholics living in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the council founded by francis of the cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task to find ways to reform the church .
in the past the pope decided everything alone .
&quot; now francis has selected the eight cardinals to help him , &quot; valero said .
he said that it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that francis the cardinals ask for advice .
but so far , we were not in this situation - this is all very new .
valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals appointed would , however , route francis &quot; full of surprises - we know that is not who he appoints . &quot;

europe &apos;s elite is ready to do business with the united kingdom ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in the united kingdom , to want to change our relationship with the eu .
to this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey commissioned by british business leaders and asked them what they think about the united kingdom , the economy and the eu .
yougov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders , some of which depict the british company sizes , sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow , while the states in the eu are stagnant .
they wish that new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil are favoured by government regulators , rather than to deal with the long and exhausting process , the obscure to reform eu institutions .
asked for their view on certain legal issues - from the antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders is of the opinion that control of these key competences should be brought back to westminster .
there was widespread dissatisfaction about the internal market , according to the company , because the cost of brussels regulations now would outweigh the benefits to be part of europe &apos;s trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to , which are traditionally the most pro-european .
finally , and this is probably the most , showed a survey of business leaders that a clear majority of britain wants a course in the direction of the change of the agreement and a relationship with the eu based on trade , not on politics .
this realization that finds itself in companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is on a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings the driver &apos;s seat of the world economy back to britain .
it is about a lot - a change of the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a change of view in favour of the participation in the eu in a referendum at 16 percent .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the uk conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and necessary to an increasing extent after the eurozone is now moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority should be jobs and growth in britain , as the results of our survey shows , which means an increased emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach for rules for companies .

kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
&quot; we are in a frightening situation and one must wonder : what is preventing parliament from tomorrow simply to abolish the judicial independence ? , &quot; was to read in the newspaper that keeps the bill for not under the constitution .
&quot; the law is draconian and very punitively and we reject it , &quot; said cyrus kamau , managing director of capital group , including capitalfm , one of kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
he said that the new media tribunal &quot; will always be prejudiced , because it is an extension of the government , &quot; and restrictions on content and advertising would damage kenya &apos;s position in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president is listening to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to the house , &quot; he said .
according to the newspaper the star note the government effectively through the new law &quot; the media writes in a stranglehold . &quot; on the other hand , the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in kenya had suffered &quot; a severe blow &quot; and titled the draft as &quot; draconian . &quot;
the adoption of the law is one of a series of measures that national security should be strengthened following the attacks by armed islamists on the west gate mall in september .
the kenyan media drew the wrath of the authorities in itself , because it was published photographs of security cameras on which to see , like the units posted at the crime scene , supposedly the luxurious shopping mall ausraubten .
police chief david kimaiyo responded with the einbestellung interrogations of two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the subpoena was withdrawn after an outcry in the media .
under the new law , media houses can be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million , as well as the additional risk of losing their professional recognition or be excluded from an official press accreditation .
the tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected , if a fine is not paid .
according to the daily nation , &quot; a single penalty push for most radio stations in the bankruptcy . &quot;
in addition , the newspaper is of the view that these measures could have a devastating impact on their description to &quot; lively blogosphere &quot; in kenya .
if they were to silence the media , politicians with impunity could do whatever they want .
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote mutuma mathiu , a journalist at the nation , of the kenyan media described as a crucial factor in public life .
&quot; leaves you politicians themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and gatherers , &quot; he commented .
the kenyan legislators had been the public anger in the past .

supreme court confirmed obama &apos;s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court ruled today that the closely associated with barack obama health law is constitutional .
by five votes to four , the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act , it is forcing us citizens to complete a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty , is constitutional under the tax authority of the state .
the chief judge john roberts fought on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the judge warren , thomas , alito and kennedy decided against it .
the court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law and also took the view that the imposition of the health law that states would either have to broaden the access requirements for medicaid or otherwise removed all state medicaid funding , is not unconstitutional restrictive .
the lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law had been firmly rejected by all the leading republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger mitt romney , in the pre-election battle in 2012 .

gutach : more safety for pedestrians
they are not 100 meters apart : on tuesday has been commissioned the new b 33-pedestrian traffic light at the village car park in gutach - within sight of the older town hall lights .
two plants so close together : intention or shield citizens string ?
this question has clearly answered gutachs mayor yesterday .
&quot; the town hall traffic light has been installed at the time that the school guarantees , &quot; explained eckert yesterday .
the kluser-traffic lights secure both cyclists as well as been underlined here many times and the bergle residents .
the plant used yesterday officially in operation is important for the crossing area sulzbachweg / church street .
we have the museum , two churches , park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank , and the traffic flow from the residential area › grub . &quot;
&quot; had to come up with the high traffic and foot paths to their safety in another traffic lights , &quot; eckert .
it also confirms peter arnold from the local health authority offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements pass on the b 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles the municipality of gutach , of which about 10 percent are heavy traffic , &quot; said arnold .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is just before , &quot; says arnold .
as a whole had been carried out four road shows , also a roundabout was considered , but discarded because of the tightness in the intersection area sulzbachweg / church street .
it was , according to arnold in the siting of the traffic light poles before all tested : &quot; by means of an extra for us with a particularly long wooden trunks loaded we have equipped van te tet , whether these vehicles can exit from the sulzbachweg onto b 33 , without the traffic light poles umzuknicken . &quot;
the approximately 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the &quot; state-of-the-art , which there are currently on the market , &quot; explained arnold .
the plant is equipped with coloured leds , which shine so strong that the lights of the car drivers , for example , are also good for deep-outsider sun .
and economically , it is also light : the older plants consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three light installations in each direction .
arnold said the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
the pedestrian expresses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
the road is free , immediate green for pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrians can be brought to an end .
&quot; if a group or handicapped people on the streets , the green phase will be extended , so it is everyone safe on the road , &quot; said arnold .
of course , the car drivers here as a partner must think ahead and watch the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the green light for pedestrians , out ahead of an upper-class vehicle - in bright red .

today was a discussion proposal released by the government , after the former member of the labor party , maxine mckew , had condemned the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers , because they could be seen as an insult by australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; loud statements like that foreigners should set back &quot; and that australians first set &quot; are a very unpleasant throwback at a time when unions demanded a protected labour market , &quot; she said of the australia india institute today .
historically , it said , that white workers should be protected , and if some people in the region , an echo of this historic artifact vernähmen , i would not be surprised .
the debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by former immigration minister chris bowen .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who visited sri lanka yesterday for talks on people smuggling , has five of the recommended changes implemented , the others are still under consideration .
if the &quot; authenticity &quot; criterion is accepted , then someone who applied for a visa , could be reviewed if the request is real in the cases , in which the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring company or personally connected . &quot;
companies could also be required to account for the number of 457-visa holders , after companies that initially only wanted to support a small number of workers in the past , finally stopped hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri-lankischer asylant probably died from a heart attack , after he was this week with a refugee boat arrived on christmas island .

with three giant reflectors in 45 metres , on wednesday , a century dream come true .
&quot; finally ! , &quot; families mayor steinar mountain country during the launch ceremony in the broadcaster tv2 .
some valley advanced sun chairs around , others put on sunglasses for security reasons .
so far , sun-seekers had to travel with a cable car to a nearby summit in the winter .

among other things , it is about direct democracy , members of corruption and the federal police .
in the morning , the working group of migration and integration also wanted to continue their deliberations .
at the same time it will go by , among other things , the issue of dual citizenship , in which both sides have conflicting ideas .
the spd would end the compulsion for immigrant children born in germany to opt for one - the union rejects a double pass .
the issue of transport , which is not on the agenda for this friday , underpinned the spd &apos;s no to a car toll requested by the csu .
a vignette is a &quot; flat rate for travel a lot and thus environmentally counterproductive , &quot; said the spd negotiator for the transport issue , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
it threatened alternative traffic on the roads were already black spots .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would be out of sight pronolds also only a first step .
&quot; there is a danger that the compensation for germans will be removed at a later date , &quot; he said .
glitzy piepsen disturbs residents
rhenus midgard has also invested heavily on land .
they distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump .
the company has several irons in the fire at the site .
in addition to the coal import , rhenus midgard sets , among other things , on wind plant logistics .
black shimmer coal on the storage space in front of the dam .
two enormous blue haldenschütt- and return chargers distribute or loaded coal here on demand .
in every movement of the handling equipment sounds a shrill warning noise over the terrain .
&quot; the signals are used in the health and safety are required by law , &quot; says matthias schrell , managing director of the rhenus midgard in wilhelmshaven .
when the wind unfavorably is unfortunately widely to hear - and so there was already some complaints of people from the city north .
he take the complaints very seriously and have therefore in contact with the victims , says the 40-year-old .
in close consultation with the authorities , it is now in the process of keeping the warning signs with technical measures quieter .
in the future , he put on the open dialogue with its neighbours .
because matthias schrell still has a lot in front at the site .
with the expansion of lower saxons bridge , rhenus midgard remain on the import of coal for power stations and is one of the great in this sector in europe .
thanks to 18.5 meters deeper bath for a long time , the terminal will be cleared cape-size bulk carrier here .
&quot; this year we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark the envelope , &quot; says schrell .
in addition to the local eon-power plant is the import coal to power plants in the interior of the country .
if the gdf-suez-power plant will still go to the net , some 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic .
the three ship-loaders on the bridge , as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million .

&quot; the community is happy , &quot; maier said .
eur 100 000 were scheduled in the budget .

&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; maier is pleased .
halloween 2013 : in figures
when i was little , halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , late aufbleiben and disguise ourselves for the neighborhood .
today , i am rather become a halloween muffle .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home , and it will probably also do not do this year .
but , according to the statistics , i am a black sheep , as regards halloween .
the majority of americans - 158 million , to be precise - celebrate halloween this year and give it a total of $ 6.9 billion for candy , costumes and decorations , as the american association of retailers ( direction and advice on military policy and strategy ) .
one thing on which i am every halloween back then , are the trend values .
the costumes are issued for roughly 1.2 billion of 6.9 billion us dollar amount , so the direction and advice on military policy and strategy .
this year are inanimate objects of the rage artist christine hill .
women do not have to invest more in sexy clothes , you can now also embody tempting food like pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as for men , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet the daft punk space men will create this year in the instagram feeds .
according to google , the most wanted costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we have dressed our dogs last year and were not alone in order to my surprise .
indeed , americans are $ 330 million this year for costumes of their pets , so the direction and advice on military policy and strategy .
that is a lot of &quot; hot dogs . &quot;
as for candy , we are not squeamish .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the nielsen company .
there are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lutschern , sweets and gummi bears .
that is good news for the 41 million people , according to the us commerce department &apos;s draw with the slogan &quot; sweet and sour &quot; through the quarter .
in fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and , let &apos;s face it , eat .
the only thing that we do not want to consume , is the sugar-sweet candy corn ; however , 15 million kilograms of them are sold for halloween , as the national association of the confectionery manufacturer .
that is about nine billion corn grains .
it is a mystery that i still could not solve .
nothing is more on halloween as houses , in which it haunting .
they have great names like &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , &quot; beat-o-scream &quot; and &quot; the house of shock . &quot;
there are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the united states , the $ 500 million proceeds reach , as america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which it is precisely in the pants pinkelt and then put the friends on facebook , where they cannot back into existence , and then the guy you will leave a comment like &quot; nice facial expression . &quot;
but we will finally bite to the free skate .
familiar with the great pumpkin , charlie brown made us when we were children , and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like that decorate the christmas tree - something that we have made from childhood on .
fortunately , the &quot; baby in the pumpkin &quot; -trend only last year thanks to public transportation , rest , so most of us have grown up , the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not , to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the us census bureau .
the pumpkin lantern , which slowly rotting in the front yard , probably comes from illinois , where 245 million kilograms this year have been harvested pumpkins .
if you really want to score points , then call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and carve something pretty from the 921 pound pumpkin .

according to german media , the bat wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a verbal exchange between the united states and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence , was again in september to the fact that the united states does not use possibilities of foreign espionage , &quot; in order to steal trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of american companies , so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits . &quot;
but since edward snowden , the whistleblower that former employees , with the publication of his fill horn has begun on u.s. surveillance secrets , european governments and corporate chiefs are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .
reports that the us national security agency , the brazilian oil company petrobras spied on and has obtained the data of us cloud providers including google and yahoo , have brought the company paranoia about government surveillance to a new record level .
the last straw was the revelation that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone verwanzt , possibly for the last 10 years .
if the most powerful person in europe can get targeted , then certainly business lines are potential targets .
snowden has made the intensive cooperation between us intelligence agencies and companies in a transparent manner .
i believe that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany needs to wake up , &quot; said oliver green , president of the bitmi representing small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the united states was now almost as big a risk as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft go , as a poll published by the consultant firm ey in july .
in the documents leaked by snowden , there was , however , no evidence so far that the united states has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies .
politicians have expressed their concern that the eu lacked certain it and internet opportunities and they should reduce their dependence on the united states .
the companies are skeptical about this .
in the bundestag , it was suggested that we should build a german google .
i can close my eyes and open them slowly ...
&quot; it does not work that way , &quot; says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software maker sap .
if you had wanted a strong european it industry , would not let it die out over 20 years ago .
all in germany will be subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture .
everything , except for the it industry .
however , scope and technical sophistication of the us espionage authorities revealed by the snowden revelations shocked firms , which had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in china .
the cloud computing will take place a big change , because european business leaders are now aware that data stored in the united states are subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the cloud security alliance , a trade body , rejected after the revelations about the us data mining activities with prism about ten percent of the members are not based in the united states plans to use an american supplier .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : &quot; we see a new question of customers that there was not yet a year ago - it is : where will my data stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this area ? &quot;
many german business leaders believe that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew , which is that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and they must therefore be guarded at any price .
it is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place .
this has always been the case .
&quot; it was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion , &quot; says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level , just as we do , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the management does not normally on the counter-measures it has taken , because that gives attackers benefits .
in large companies , employees long eingebläut that take away a free usb sticks at a trade fair or the unguarded leave a laptop in the hotel rooms is not advisable , to say the least .
ulrich hackenberk , a board member at automaker audi , says that it has been standard practice for years belong to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they cannot be used as a abhörgeräte .
the german bat advises executives , simple to use prepaid phones , if they can go on trips abroad , because smartphones may be compromised .
later , the prepaid mobile phones are thrown away .
however , there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leader in the respective niche .
&quot; small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and the financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access , &quot; warns the bat in a report .
the united states warn their own companies against economic espionage by other countries .
according to the washington post , france , russia and israel behind china in second place of the countries were included in the us national intelligence estimate in february , which is used for the procurement of economic data of the hackings .
a member of a german blue-chip company agreed to go , when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bernard squarcini , former head of the french domestic intelligence service dcrl , this month was quoted in an interview with the following words : &quot; the intelligence services know very well that all countries spy , even if they work together in the fight against terrorism , its allies . &quot;
when the horse show-experts in droves in cardiff incident andes , to select the horse of the year , was aware of them that a rat race .
but no one was prepared for the three-year-old fenton kirkland .

howells said : &quot; the whole audience was as electrifying and all have cheered him and clapping . &quot;
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he has done a fantastic job .
fenton is crazy after animals - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens , to look after himself .
as it is launched , it will not take long until he is on the &quot; horse of the year &quot; -schau - and i am sure that he will do well .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said : &quot; fenton is only three , but he knows what he has to deal with his pony . &quot;
together , they are a great team .
the jury assessed fenton and toffee according to how well they had beaten and presented in the vorführring .

i am sure that fentons sweet clothing has played its part , it was really perfect for the occasion .

rescue package over 325 million australian dollars for tasman health care
the australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are associated with the rescue package on 325 million australian dollars for the tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money .
federal health minister tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth would take &quot; immediate measures &quot; to avert a crisis that has been caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints .
the funding for a period of four years , was decided after government consultations with the independent tasmanian mp andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has declared an emergency rescue package , which in our view , the unique challenges facing the state , &quot; plibersek today .
the $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral performance .
another 2,600 operations , including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey star , is intended to eliminate residues .
in addition , there is money for daily clinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare for inpatient stays , the specialist training , services in the field of mental health , and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments are in line with the ideas , of which i am concerned clinic employees have said that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , &quot; said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tasmanian government .
the state must retain the current funding level , in order to receive money from the commonwealth , and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent .
a three-member commission will be set up and is intended to ensure that the state provide health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would benefit little , if they are not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the public tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course . &quot;
nevertheless , he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid , which he first have expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to take the public health system of the state of the worry list , &quot; wilkie said .
according to the state government this election services are largely offset by the recent cuts .
but the public health spokesman peter dutton , the opposition at the federal level , is of the opinion that today &apos;s announcement is just a &quot; sticking plaster solution . &quot;
&quot; we are therefore in the current situation , because the labor-state government has deducted $ 430 million from the health care system , &quot; he said on abc tv .
it cannot be that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the commonwealth 300 million into it , and then act as if the good news .
dutton called plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

sayings come from the bible
more than 40 women visited the last women breakfast this year in the protestant parish bisingen .
the theme of the day in the town house were &quot; sayings from the bible &quot; and &quot; phrases from the middle ages . &quot;
zita köhler , the chairman of the municipal council of churches , went after the breakfast in a lecture on the biblical proverbs .
&quot; proverbs contain life skills , rules or warnings , &quot; she said .
they compared with the corresponding bible several proverbs and explained the importance .
they called sayings such as wood eye is vigilant , as scales fall from their eyes , cast an eye on someone , his own there &apos;s the lord during sleep , wash its hands .
on several occasions , the speaker also advise their listeners , which saying it was .
the phrases from the middle ages took the kirchengemeinderätin christel stretcher to : all good things come in threes , blue , something more wetlands .
they explained the meaning and origin of the phrases that they called &quot; bridges in the past &quot; .
the conclusion was a raffle tickets .
the prices were covered on a table and were described humorously before they were handed over to the winners .
among the visitors , the breakfast round interfered with mayoral candidate novel waizenegger .
you could call him the dostoyevsky of the united states .
philip k. dick was a god viewfinder , a meta-physicist , his novels and stories have something serial .
amazingly the kinship in the outer : the sharp eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fyodor dostoevsky m. with his massive body of work is meant as ergründer and apologists of the russian soul , one reads philip k. dick than american prophets , which is quite something in their own country .
some titles are published in the world publishing , the lagoon mans-cassette with 118 stories sells two thousand one .
dick explains america - the kingdom of the breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security mania and the belief that to be chosen .
dick had god experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , had his brain drugs .
he understood that the computer divinitäten early .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine , the creator of his creation .
this is the &quot; blade runner &quot; problem .
the killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have inspired film directors like ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
this story is particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates back to 1956 , he exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy-tribunals .
it is the principle of &quot; pre-crime &quot; developed , &quot; pre-crime , &quot; so what is now more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dicks world that resembles our own terrifying look mutants in the future - and the police , too .
&quot; we have capture individuals who violate any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we can grab it to us , even before they commit a violent crime . &quot;
and : &quot; there is no serious criminals in our society , we have a penal camp full pesudoverbrecher . &quot; they read time flows .
they assume that bad things happen , and will prevent the criminal idea into a reality .
dicks narrative acts like the blueprint for the nsa &apos;s anti-terror laws and the abhörrausch .
anticipation of the attack : that works as well as obama &apos;s drone-philosophy and practice .
but dicks story is not yet over .
the police chief complained that there was no longer the separation of powers , the military controlled the everyday life - and what is left by the state .
then the monitor itself will be monitored and convicted of a future crime .
the system turns .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it invents its own conditions .
makes mistakes and victims not only in sales , but builds on itself .
the system creates the risk that it fought .
read philip k. dick says , again and again , to come closer to the truth .
court blocks decision to stop-and-frisk directive of the nypd
the arrangement of a judge on thursday blocked a federal appeals court in the united states , which had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ( &quot; stop and search &quot; ) of the new york police department , and frelimo , the judge of the case .
the 2nd u.s. appeals court said that rulings by judge shira scheindlin would be suspended , pending a decision on an appeal of the city .
the judge had ruled in august that the city goes against the constitution with the way the program will be implemented for the stopping and questioning of people .
the city appealed against their assessment and the ordered a corrective measures , including the decision to set up a monitoring office , which should support the police in the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training program .
the appeal court heard the arguments to the required suspension on tuesday .
the appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case , since they have violated the code of conduct for american judges appointed by is that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was founded in part with a series of media interviews and public statements , in which they had publicly responded to the criticism of the court .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were inappropriately specifically targeting black and latin american men with the stop-and-frisk program .
they appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms to policies , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with the body worn cameras in districts where most checks were carried out .
in august , the city of new york is willing to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people who have been released again after a check by the police .
an oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for march 14 , 2014 .
the stop-and-frisk tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights advocates .
such controls are there for decades in various forms , but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the non-party mayor michael bloomberg on an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and latin american men .
2004 was developed by four men , who were all minorities , the complaint to a class action .
advocates of changes to the stop-and-frisk program of the nypd say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way , use the scheme as other police chiefs .
opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not the crime ; nor would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force , which is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that they do not have the stop-and-frisk practice that was constitutional , but the way of implementation of controls by the nypd reformiere .
anger over judgment for bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people were killed in the bombing in bali in 2002 , reacted angrily on the verdict for the past the instigator , who was put on trial because , in their view , umar patek should be summarily .
patek , who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons of south-east asia , was sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years for his role in the construction of shells for the bomb attack yesterday .
with criminal suspension , he could be released after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 australians , and many more were injured .
a guilty verdict was also included in a series of terrorism-related charges , including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
the prosecution had demanded a life sentence , although they would have the death penalty for the man , who is also called the &quot; demolition man &quot; because of his reputation as a master bomb maker , can apply .
the decision has aroused painful memories in june corteen , a mother from perth , the 39-year-old twin daughters jane and jenny has lost in the devastation caused by patek and his mitverschwörern nearly ten years ago .
fighting back tears , she said , patek should have been sentenced to death .
i mean , he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; you should ask him before a firing squad , &quot; said corteen towards aap .
i have to live with every day that i will get no further grandchildren and i will never see my daughters .
the sari club was razed to the ground , as on 12 october 2002 shortly after 11 p.m. , a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck , which was parked in front of the nightclub .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives .
he fell into a coma after the attack for a month and &quot; died &quot; three times while he was on a life support system .
hughes said , patek have earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell jemaah islamiah , amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra , who were responsible for the massacre and executed in four years .
really , this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else .
to keep him alive , no , there is no reason to keep him alive .
to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bomber , who was in court .
he took almost a decade of the arrest , but was finally picked up in january 2011 in abbottabad in pakistan , where us forces nearly four months later the former al-qaeda chief osama bin laden killed .
during the trial , said an fbi agent from that intelligence reports had provided the reference to patek was in pakistan to meet bin laden with the aim to rebuild the link between southeast asian terrorist groups and al-qaeda .
&quot; he has not asked , &quot; said corteen .
until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people .
the ruling came in this year , which will be committed with commemorations in bali and australia before the 10th anniversary of the attack .
&quot; there will be many tears this year , &quot; said corteen .
patek can still appeal against his sentence .

previously the greens federal mp hans-christian stroebele met snowden in moscow yesterday as the first german politician , in order to talk with him about the affair .

a trial for attempted manslaughter , dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has started before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
he is accompanied by strict security measures .
the defendants were silent at the beginning .

traffic lights on dauerrot : pay attention to waiting
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loop responded in the street , or the light signal is defective .
what can we do - go on red ?
the affected has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free , he can continue that explains the stuttgart lawyer ralf becker in the magazine &quot; motorcycle . &quot;
however , the waiting time must be &quot; reasonable &quot; what could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis .
becker advises to wait at least five minutes , before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected .
if the trip despite rotlichts continues , should , however , be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused as a result .
who is tolerated less than five minutes , waiting may not long enough , warns becker and points to a decision of the higher regional court hamm .
negotiated in the case had a driver after about three minutes dauerrot ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light violation .
the traffic light was not damaged , but jumped to a little later on green .

any loss of profit for bombardier to decline in supply numbers and contracts
the canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer bombardier inc reported a 15-percent decline of net profit on thursday , after he was under pressure by declining orders and deliveries in aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail division .
bombardier , based in montreal , also no flight test data for its brand new cseries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane could go next september in the commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable .
on the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago followed so far only three more starts , which makes it appear doubtful whether the trial period runs as planned .
the results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , an analyst at national bank financial , thursday lowered his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; outperform &quot; in view of the fact that the share price has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters .
&quot; although weaker supply figures in aircraft have been widely expected , but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , &quot; said doerksen to write to a customer .
we believe that if the test program is progressing on the plane , bombardier will receive new orders for the cseries .
if , however , no new orders will be announced in the coming months , we expect that the market is skeptical toward the program .
bombardier hopes that the cseries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment , which is currently dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test plane was presented to the public in march and flew for the first time in september after months of delays .
but so far are binding orders for the cseries with 177 moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flights and would like to see whether the allegations against the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft is correct .
there are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jets .
the company management also assured on thursday with analysts and the media , the program lies in the schedule .
&quot; the test aircraft is not stayed on the ground longer than expected , &quot; said beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the life of the aircraft had been scheduled to ground tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is different .

the rules on electronic devices on planes remain in australia for the time being in force
australian airline passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the united states , to relax the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) allows us airlines to change their rules so that passengers can see or play on their devices during critical flight phases read e-books , videos , if they are located in the &quot; flight mode .
while the bulk of the flight &apos;s passengers already allowed this , but many people are angry that they cannot read the launch and the landing of their e-books .
australian companies see the decision to implement the us airlines have to do a lot of work , but have no immediate plans to change its rules .
the air traffic control authority casa said also that we will look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in australia still apply .
&quot; casa currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane , &quot; was announced .
the issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines maintain the security at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew .
virgin has already held talks with the casa on a widening use of wi-fi-entertainment system on flights and said it is open to changes , but these should be initiated by the legislator .
&quot; we would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the casa because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience , after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , &quot; a spokesman said .
qantas said that it will remain in the current rules until further notice .
&quot; our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during the launch and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , &quot; said the company .
the faa rules apply to american carriers .
we are always interested in developments in regulations , from which passengers can benefit , and we will certainly look the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies vary depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , baggage-change programs , as well as customer instruction .
&quot; after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers using portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smart phones at every level , &quot; announced the faa .
in rare cases in poor visibility , the crew will instruct the passengers , while landing disable the devices .
the group also recommended heavier devices in to store launch and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects on the seats .

because he feared that stockholm will extradite him to the united states , he had sought refuge in the ecuadorian embassy in london on june 19 and asked for political asylum from the south american country .

revolutionary work of church music

after the huge success of the musical &quot; rock of my life , &quot; which wowed the audience in the spring of this year , will enrich the songs wreath at the end of the jubilee year two religious services with the performance of the deutsche messe of franz schubert .
on saturday , october 26 , this extraordinary show from 19 during the evening mass at the church of st. martinus dunn ) , and on sunday , october 27 , at 10.15 a.m. at the church service in the st. john baptist church in varnishes village to be heard .
the so-called deutsche messe with the original title &quot; songs to celebrate the sacred victim of the fair , &quot; d 872 , a spiritual music station of the composer franz schubert from 1826 and was seen at the time of the birth is almost as revolutionary .
the fair will be listed in the context of the religious services as the client johann philipp neumann had in mind .
under the leadership of herman schneider , the choir accompanied by the brass group of the musikverein gladness tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
scientists were able to throw more light on it , is the context in which the tail wag the dog with his mood .
previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail stretched more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left-hand side with nervous dogs .
but now , scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it .
professor giorgio vallortigara , neuroscientists at the university of trento , said : &quot; when people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to other sources that produce positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we have tried to look at this in other species .
he also noted that the right brain hemisphere in dogs as in humans was responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .
to learn more about it , as dogs respond to the lateral tail wag of their own kind , monitored the researchers viewed the animals , while these films from other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the dog and analyzed the behavior .
probably we will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , even in the other
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette , in order to eliminate ablenkende other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
if the animals were , like the other expression of a dog &apos;s tail has moved to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedel-dog ) , they were completely relaxed .
but was mainly the tail tilt to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog wag ) , as increased their heart rate and they looked restless .
in the opinion of professor vallortigara the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience , in which movements they should worry about , and when they are not .
he said : &quot; if you have different encounters with other dogs and a swish with the cock in one direction rather is associated with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior , then responded to on the basis of this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that the findings could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal for dog owners , veterinarians and trainers .
john bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the university of bristol has said that this is not the first study , which has been investigated , whether on the left and the right is important for dogs .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln found out that dogs turn your head to the left , if they see an aggressive dog , and on the right , if we are talking about a happy dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada was the following : &quot; dogs go on a robot dog when the tail wag &quot; on the left , not the right , rather than to be restless , rather than the other way around in the italian study . &quot;
according to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies of the animals in the movies or the robot dogs are not interpreted as a dog .
a study how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he said .
&quot; although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes , but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception , &quot; said brad shaw .
since their behavior record but simply put , it will probably not last a long time , until we understand why the tail sometimes moved in one direction , sometimes in the other .
tony blair has said that he would use the opportunity to return as the prime minister of the united kingdom - but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .

on the question of whether he would like to return to the office of the prime minister , blair was quoted by the evening standard in london with the words : &quot; yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this happens , so ... &quot;

pawnshops boom in singapore , as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
in a pawn shop in the shopping centre bendemeer in singapore trades janani amir from inga a golden thank , a ring and a pair of earrings in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters .
&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house , as is all my money in it , &quot; says amir ( inga .
although they earn 3,000 singapore dollars ( ca 1.730 euros ) every month as a government worker and her husband also work , rich in the monthly family income , they explained .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia - where the debt of households is increasing - is so large that valuemax , where they made their exchange , this week became the third deposit house , which is listed on the singapore stock exchange .
the pledge of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money - 1,300 singapore dollars , as well as in the case of janani amir ( inga - nearly as cheap as an unsecured bank loans .
typically require pawnshops in singapore an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent , which is only just above the 15.4 percent , which requires the united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall .
pawnshops offer but the advantage , that does not require proof of income or review of the credit rating , and loans faster than banks are possible .
for this reason turn millions of people in the region to pawnshops , after families feel the pressure by rising living costs , as well as a growing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose monetary policy in developed economies are looking for families with low and medium incomes pawnshops on , in order to compensate for the difference in stotternder economy .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing household debt , mainly by rising mortgage , as a risk factor for the credit worthiness of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand and singapore , according to the agency &apos;s highest household debt relative to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia is still in 2008 with 80 percent of gdp at the top of the list , an increase of 60 percent .
economists also worry because of the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week has just emerged from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a weakening of consumer demand .
&quot; in the end , it means that faced with rising costs of the people in the middle and lower segment ( of the income scale ) will try to supplement their income , wherever it is possible , &quot; said song seng wun , economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
historic levels in gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the trend for pledging personal items , as the people have the opportunity to turn the family jewelry into cash .
in singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged items are pawn shops of the city-state of gold in the 200 .
the people say : &quot; the price of gold looks good , let us pledge grandmother &apos;s gold chain and bring back next month . &quot;
the largest thai pawn shop operator , easy money , has seen a 20 % customer growth in the last few months in its stores .
the growth in the mortgage business is so strong that valuemax , operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 other wants to expand in singapore , not only in the neighboring malaysia , where the company operates four houses , but also outside asia , lee ching yeah , managing director of valuemax .
the company financed that to 60 percent of the 66 million singapore dollars that it took this week with the ipo in singapore .
while some lenders because of high interest rates were caught in the crossfire , said yeah that pawnshops not only lower interest rates than other lenders would not directly , but also the debt increased .
&quot; customers a loan items that they already have , and that liquefy personal valuables do not increase the budget training , &quot; she explained .
the mortgage loan business , society is increasingly accepted as a short-term secured funding .
also , not all people who use pawn shop , are in financial difficulties .
rich people come from singapore also in the branches of valuemax to mortgage gold bars and rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
customers come to us from every social class .
&quot; these include the wealthy , something in the short term for a business or an investment loan , or small businesses , have to bridge the bottlenecks in the cash-flow , &quot; says mitch .
sometimes they need just money very quickly .

this is quietly to continue .
kaderänderungen there will be little in the winter transfer period .
there is no great reason to change something .

a study was announced by the british government , which is intended to increase the benefits of the hs2 railway project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd proposes , even with the start of phase 1 of the year 2026 to achieve high-speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project &quot; will be britain closer together . &quot;
the scottish transport minister keith brown said he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after the completion of phase 2 , there will be links to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government revised the estimated cost of £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion for the construction of the high-speed link between london and the north of england .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , instructed hs2 ltd to look for other routes capacities and travel time improvements for the north of england and scotland .
these include the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of glasgow and edinburgh to london at the end of the day .
baroness kramer said : &quot; our aim for hs2 is a truly national network , the united kingdom and its cities closer together . &quot;
we go ahead with hs2 , because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which will improve thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary alistair ap commented : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland . &quot;
on behalf of the scottish government called keith brown ap to use &quot; unequivocal &quot; for the scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
brown said : &quot; the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , at the same time , but also the economic strength of scotland an argument for fast rail links across the uk . &quot;
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which creates benefits for all and the glasgow-edinburgh link added that the scottish government already plans .
i look forward to the investigation report with the british ministers to consider next year and work together to decide on the next steps .
live with good prospects
actually lives waltraud ries fantastically .
their house is in a residential area of stuttgart , set in an old trees , nice neighbors and not too much traffic .
there are only a few minutes by public transport in the city .
&quot; hopefully , you have no fear of spiders ? , &quot; asks waltraud ries and shows at a fat spider on door frames .
i am already looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time .
but you know how difficult it is in stuttgart .
the reason is not a spider phobia , but the concern , however , in the age of the many steps to the house and no longer able to cope in the apartment , she says .
moreover , since a meniscus tears-operation , the mitt fifty woman has experienced what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor .
recently , a book published by her on &apos; happy living in old age - what home form is the best for me ? &apos; .
&quot; our home is the best example of what the age is not allowed , &quot; she begins to tell .
when they moved into the apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with mid-fifties , waltraud ries thinks differently about it .
but they also know that it is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most displace it , as long as it is .
old are always the others &apos; , she says an enduring formative influence .
only when the suffering is really great , do you have thoughts .
&quot; then it may be too late , &quot; says ries .
in her book , the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age .
&apos;what living form it chooses , is always an individual decision , &quot; she says .
d i s solution were it not for the ages .
even those who can afford the age retirement home in tuscany or brittany should always consider that he could also be ill .
and : &quot; without a good knowledge of the language association , it is also in the dolce vita , &apos; the reference book author exile willing to bear in mind .
their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing or the oft-quoted pensioner-wg .
everyone has the age he ticks and quirks
&apos;for me would be a residential community but nothing , &quot; she says with a wink .
certainly not as in a student-wg with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; in old age is simply his withdrawal rooms , as well as ries .
for a senior-living community can still work , the book writer , however , cannot be ruled out .
it must then differently than in the classic student-wg .
and sometimes one simply even his calm , &quot; she believes .
with this view , they at least in the state capital is not alone .
&quot; most old people in stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home , &apos; is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital .
the department advises people around the theme &apos; grow older . &quot;
why would just older people often inconvenience and restrictions on buying companies , only to be able to remain in their familiar surroundings , this is also the experience of the stiftung warentest .
there are many ways to make the house or flat barrier free today .
ries recommends all that deal with the age just reconstruction of their house or apartment to instruct once reliable information and not the only best craftsmen .
today is also available for the age just reconstruction specialists .
even in the rental housing will realize one thing or another , and if it is only increase the toilet seat , clarifies the interior designer .
but the existing housing age is not always fair and thus transform barrier-free , even if it is still so beautiful .
this experience has had to make waltraud ries .
while one might install a stair lift inside the apartment , but the same with stairs paved way up on the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle .
it will continue to search until it has found the ideal object for themselves and her husband .
before the parade dread it over before the spider on her apartment door .

cocaine addict lawyer , the drug boss warned before police investigation , must go to jail
bash / repairers preferring , 42 , was further information at world size neil scarborough
the lawyer had fear that his secret addiction could come to light
he was sentenced to three years in prison from liverpool crown court
a well-known criminal defender , before a major police investigation of a drug baron warned , because he was afraid his secret addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
bash / repairers preferring , 42 , provided under world size neil scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction .
the lawyer kriminalisten lauded as &quot; first class &quot; with the nickname &quot; bash &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 , after the police had monitored scarborough , whom he had represented in a previous drug procedures .
officials observed , such as scarborough ( 32 ) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , expired , while it was with colleagues in a meal of the bar association .
the investigation had revealed that preferring regular class a drugs were consumed after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were at the time of the police monitored as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin- and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
along with 32 other people were later arrested after the police in a series of house searches ensured £ 1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine , as well as 200,000 pounds in cash .
preferring , 42 , gave information to the criminals , because he feared that his addiction can be known .
today , preferring , who works for the law firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , after a three-week trial at liverpool crown court found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced .
he gave to the cocaine possession in a previous survey .
the lawyer was transferred after the police in their investigations against scarborough found out that in february 2011 in regular telephone contact with preferring had stood .
two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he came to dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of the lawyer .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , was scarborough on a regular basis , preferring , who was at the dinner in the football stadium of the blackburn rovers at ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , won the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .
before the court was aware that preferring a regular consumer of cocaine was , after tests of the class a drugs were discovered in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .
preferring was later arrested , denied , however , to take cocaine and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer , because this was his client , and claimed that their discussion under the sun , &quot; lawyer secret . &quot;
during his arrest , preferring his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and he was taken from a hair sample .
when he was police interrogation , he run an office both at his private address and in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal affairs .
in court , it was announced that he had important actors of the drug trade , some of which he represented before , after significant arrests had called and informed , what the investigators knew about it .
state attorney anne whyte said : &quot; a criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don &apos;t break the law . &quot;
preferring is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender , since he has become very engaged with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer , which his lawyer supplied with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .
but that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was the police investigation as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr preferring that brought his profession into disrepute .
he was too close to certain clients , particularly in scarborough , and he allowed that its independence was compromised .
preferring denied any wrongdoing and said : &quot; if i were a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and wanted to pass on information to scarborough , then i would not wait for 15 hours , but do it immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing , said superintendent lee halstead by the police in lancashire : &quot; mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment , when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime that commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public .
preferring has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
the serious and organised crime unit of lancashire headed the investigation against preferring , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the obstruction of justice and possession of cocaine , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we will find you and bring you to justice .
scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of conspiracy to heroin- , cocaine and cannabis trade .
thirty-five more involved in the drug trade &apos; people have been sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website , preferring a field with questions and answers about yourself , in which he cited , it was his dream job , as a lawyer to represent clients on death row in america that his ultimate guest at the dinner was mohammed ali and inequality is the motivation for his work .
until now , the police inspection agencies can look back on a quiet halloween night .
the officials have been called twice only to children throwing eggs , which threw them against building facades .
as the house owner recognized this in time and the egg remains equally remote , should also be no material damage .
furthermore , some sylvesterböller were ignited in the city as well , but there is no material damage .
a resident in the bishop-freundorfer way reported that his car wrapped with toilet paper and his radzierblenden were stolen .
until the arrival of the police , the man his radzierblenden , however , in the immediate vicinity all recovered , and the police had no further action .

council adopted track system targeting
should the railway crossing &quot; am hirschen &quot; consuming be converted to increase road safety ?
yes , have adopted the municipal councils .
schiltach must take for 220 000 euros in the hand .
deutsche bahn wants to improve the kinzigtal-railway line in the coming year .
particularly should be increased in the security at railway crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles .
the communities agree to the restructuring measures , they must engage with a third of the cost , the rest will share train and covenant .
alpina axle city architect roland grießhaber explained to the local council of the peculiarities of the bahübergangs &quot; am hirschen . &quot;
there , the city plans to build a bulge in the amount of the local tunnel mouth west of the railroad tracks .
there could also be against traffic in larger vehicles , such as those that carry long wood , without having to block the tracks .
grießhaber suggested , therefore , to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the appropriate time , in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow .
this was controversial in the local council , as some councils went into question the need for a road spread : thomas tilt brought the mood of critics with his statement to the point : &quot; we need to take so much money for so few vehicles in the hand ? &quot;
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing hirschen will regularly used for long wood transportation .
even wood from the area &quot; kuhbach &quot; will be transported in part on this route , because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route to the häberlesbrücke because they could not turn in the main street .
moreover , serve the route as a diversion for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel , where the main street is locked , argued haas .
as was clear that kirch mountain and schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in highest expectations , the railway crossing &quot; am hirschen could also play an important traffic importance for a long period of time .
the council agreed to investigate , which costs would cause the expansion of the road .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing the majority agreed with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall will be built so that the city could expand the subsequent road towards &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; if necessary for meeting traffic at around 5.5 meters .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tannery trautwein could , however , lead to a different problem , which concerns the driveway in the rapidly growing &quot; geroltzhäuser way &quot; .
the administration had the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering office breinlinger examined , as they had the doubt whether the planned end of the geroltzhäuser way will still be possible without further ado .
the study concluded that should not be ruled out that the tendency conditions of the road that could lead to longer vehicles up .
wearing the responsibility for this , in turn , the city as road construction last winner .
so the change could result in liability disputes .
since both the wooden collection and the extra state in the current expansion work , you should do not agree to the reconstruction of the railway crossing , argued haas .
in any case , at this point , the risk of a collision of turn on the transition of the vehicle with a significantly lower than in the other rail crossings , because it directly beside the stop in mid-linked to a good view .
even trains from the main railway station , were already at this point as far as braked to avoid a collision threat .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing the permission was denied by a majority , since the city schiltach the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles &quot; would have to carry the can , &quot; says the councils , as the train after the completion of the construction work could withdraw from the responsibility .
in 2006 , the body which conversions at railway crossings &quot; before the village &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach , &quot; for which already crossing agreements were taken by train .

the largest visitor attraction of the festival include an interview : david steinberg speaks with larry david .
steinberg started as a stand-up comedian , but has developed into a respected television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian .
from 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a television program with the title &quot; sit down comedy with david steinberg &quot; on tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of manhattan .

later , however , showed the footage of a video camera that they had arrived safely in their hotel , after they had been separated from her australian boyfriend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days , until she confessed to have concocted the story .

syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , so a monitoring group
syria have important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gitftgasmunition destroyed , said the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on thursday , when it came to serious clashes near one of the sites in the north of the country , in which allegedly toxic substances are stored .
also on thursday , a syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago now soon .
the announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came a day before the deadline on
november 1 , the organization based in the hague damascus had set in order to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or &quot; inoperabel &quot; to make , including all equipment for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions .
the conclusion of this process , in fact is the first stage of the destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all syria &apos;s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .
the destruction of the equipment means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
damascus has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies .
according to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons , including mustard gas and sarin gas in the country .
the announcement came at a time when battles on thursday in the town of safira took place , of the experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons , as well as storage sites , such as the british-based syrian observatory for human rights said .
the activist group , which tracks the number of deaths on a network of activists in syria , said on thursday that 120.296 people have died .

on july 25 , the un estimated the number of deaths in the conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not yet been updated .
the conflict has about two million people forced to flee the country .
assad &apos;s troops are fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of whom have links to al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said there have been losses on both sides on thursday , but gave no details .
the fighting underscores the danger that are exposed to the chemical weapons inspectors for their mission to the liberation of syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a raging civil war .
according to the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , whether the team is &quot; now convinced that it has seen all of syria said important production and mixing / filling equipment and witnessed the destruction . &quot;
therefore &quot; are currently planned no further inspection activities . &quot;
at the beginning of the week , the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of 23 of the sites listed by damascus .
because of security concerns whether the visit of two facilities have been impossible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc stated that the two sites had been abandoned , according to the syrian statement &quot; ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program had been transferred to other known facilities that have been inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the safira site was one of the two bodies , they could not visit the opcw inspectors .
syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the executive committee of the opwc next month .
&quot; i salute the bravery and the courage that you have shown all in fulfilling the most challenging mission that was ever carried out by this organisation , &quot; said ahmed uzumcu , the opcw director-general of the monitoring organization in a published commentary .
for three years now fighting the mainly sunni muslim rebels against assad &apos;s government and its security forces in the civil war , which includes many members of the alawites , a secession of shiite islam .
in terms of further developments said the head of the monitoring group , rami abdurrahman , there have been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the syrian coastal latakia province on wednesday .

rbs suspended two currency traders
the royal bank of scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; it is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market rapidly accelerating .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigation in the world &apos;s largest financial market , the daily $ 5.3 trillion change the owner .
the two traders would be the first rbs staff who have been suspended in the widening investigation , which entails the scandal over the libor interbank business .
the bank , which made no comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .
&quot; our investigations on the issue are continuing and we cooperate fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities , &quot; the bank said in two weeks .
last month , people close to the situation for the rbs the records of e-mails and instant messages that were sent to and from a former trader , have forwarded to the british regulator , the financial conduct authority , .
the dealer , richard usher , had left the rbs 2010 and should have been grown from his current position as a european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan cause .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , was this week cause and matt gardiner , formerly a senior currency trader at barclays and ubs , was suspended this week at standard chartered .
none of these dealers has been accused of any wrongdoing .
the instant message group of usher included bankers at barclays and citigroup , people close to the situation said .
ubs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees , after the swiss regulator finma declared that they examine a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities around the world - the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority - to deal with allegations that bankers have agreed with transactions in the currency market at present .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also begun internal investigations or receive information requests from authorities , people familiar with the situation said .
banks to comb through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news about this research has moved the dealers in a field in turmoil , which belongs to one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure , because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading dealers are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true .
a leading dealer said that despite the huge daily volume in forex trading the fragmentation of liquidity by banks between the various trading platforms and the growing use of its own internal platforms causes &quot; one with very low ticket prices can affect the market . &quot;
the news came on the same day , as credit suisse announced that it had terminated a distributor of london exchange traded funds-offices this week , after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works together with them .
&quot; we are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained , &quot; said credit suisse .

&quot; in the opinion of the prosecutor is coulson , who is now the editor of the notw , no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to discharging , but one that people like to be confronted with a story to see their reaction , &quot; said edis .
he said that notw use three procedures to research stories citizen : phone-hacking , monitoring and confrontation .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows differently from the second , the monitoring , it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about the phone-hacking ?
he denies this , but we say : &quot; and whether he knew about them . &quot;
rumours of an affair clarke &apos;s were first taken up by the notw feature editorial , as a source who was sexually interested in pawlby said : &quot; do not waste your time , together with charles . &quot;
a band with her telephone voice mails of at least three occasions was secured in mulcaires apartment in august 2006 .
the investigators also found entries on the computer of the term , were stored on the pawlby and her sister as &quot; projects .
at the time the searches ran , received the grandparents of pawlby anonymous phone calls , in which they were asked for information about them , said edis .
meanwhile , the former chief reporter neville thurlbeck and former reporter james weatherup oversaw the monitoring of the movements of pawlby .
on 18 june 2005 left coulson her a voicemail with the following content : &quot; i have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , on which i would like to speak with charles . &quot;
edis explained , coul &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important figures , such as the former home secretary david blunkett .
the jury heard on thursday that coulson blunkett have faced because of an affair with a married woman , as he himself with the co rebekah brooks &quot; was , at the time , had been married .
coulson and brooks fight to have conspired with others to hack phones between october 3 , 2000 and august 9 , 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking .
early puberty : grow up faster
african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age in custody , as studies show .
physical changes mean not yet directly the puberty
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger of early puberty
the trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues .
a mother should be worried if her daughter grow already at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics paediatricians association in orlando , florida , this week , the pediatric endokrinologe dr. paul kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among american girls and constituted a new standard .
&quot; i spend a lot of time in order to reassure parents - normally this is no sign that the quick puberty occurs , &quot; kaplowitz said .
obvious ads of the development , such as growing breasts , scham- and achselhaare and body odor , show earlier in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( appearance of the first menstrual period ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age at 12.5 years , something less than a visual arts in 1970 .
&quot; if the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarche yet , &quot; said kaplowitz , author of the book &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide for dealing with this problem that often occurs too . &quot;
time is the most accurate test , as puberty progresses .
it is controversial , which is actually the onset of puberty , but it is &quot; early ripe , &quot; if the breast surgery is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years .
in the majority of cases is slowing down the process or stagnating - something that can closely monitor a pediatrician .
faster progress could be tests indicated by a endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts can be ruled out .
there are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : the premature ageing of the bones , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults .
the recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
psycho-social aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : &quot; the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age to be in custody . &quot;
the other major problem is understandable : parents don &apos;t want their very young daughters have the period .
&quot; they are concerned because of the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side , &quot; kaplowitz said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls a woman whose daughter has received their days with ten .
even if there were the first signs and we had talked about menstruation , she was emotionally unprepared .
she was scared and excited home from school , because it was the first in her group of friends .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media were the cause .
young are similar to girls in puberty earlier .
kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years , producing a connection between body fat and the entry into puberty .
other studies support that conclusion , but there are many other factors played a role .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to be the puberty rather than their white age in custody .
there are various explanations for this .
globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions on the climate to the genes .
another mystery : although the boy &apos;s face and pubic hair grows earlier , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
other doctors at the aap conference underscored the complexity of the issue .
the emergence of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and young children .
&quot; we have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endokrinologe at the goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to be advised by her doctor , as they should talk with their child .
&quot; this may mean that you have to lead a conversation earlier than expected , &quot; advised kaplowitz .
if you remain quiet , the child responds normally good .
girls , the early bloom , need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it is sooner than thought .

before the derby spot against schalke had mitgereiste bvb trailer with flares ensured ugly scenes in the veltins-arena .
borussia dortmund announced harsh consequences as a result .
before the friday game of the football league against vfb stuttgart responded the ultras with a silence - first .
it was an unusual , almost ghostly acoustics , the viewer until shortly before the start of the league game between the german vice-champion borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart in the signal iduna park offered .
to hear were mainly the visiting fans with their voices .
the south gallery , on the other hand , where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - bvb fans are , presented himself at first exceptionally quiet : no chants , no battle cries .
the podium of the capo , who coordinates otherwise the collective spirit , remained unfilled .
and completely on the front of the grandstand blew lonely a large banner with the inscription &quot; section stadium ban . &quot;
just as a goalkeeper roman pastures jolly as always the first bvb players entered the square , brandete short-lived jubilation on .
as his team colleagues followed , there was loud singing and floating scarves - though not everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand suggested nothing .
also that stadium spokesman norbert dickel once again the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , contract extension of coach jürgen klopp - listed , was not for a holiday mood .
only five minutes before the whistle climbed the capo his podium - and that in the meantime positively with hands tangible tension erupted in a loud cry , as dickel as usual the mood in the ranks in the stadium abfragte .
finally , as always in the south stand of the series - and finally here again as usual was the loudest place in the stadium .
and at the latest , as with the start of the south gallery loud call &quot; derby winner is on &quot; came , everything was again as always .
the silence before was a response to the events of the last few days .
eve spot derby at fc schalke 04 had some of the flares mitgereisten bvb supporters in the audience ranks and fired on the spot , while almost goalkeeper roman pastures jolly hit .
the game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes blown .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke , the dortmund &apos;s top ultras subsequently received in his office - and believes it watzkes words , this was a rather added advantange date for the fanvertreter .
&quot; there will be massive cuts for the ultra-movement as a whole , &quot; proclaimed the bvb boss on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an immediate measure under said watzke the ultras a choreography for the home game against vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i have banned , &quot; he said .
we cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics .
in addition , the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until tuesday , they now have time to choose one .
otherwise , as watzke , the bvb will establish a sanction by the end of next week .
&quot; this is serious , &quot; said watzke .
you may be curious how the reactions to the south gallery , then it will be .
what happens on the road with my e-mail ?
e-mail is actually an electronic letter .
the design of the internet service e-mail has been implemented similar to the traditional post technically the letter secret ?
in the design of the early internet services stood in the foreground , communication .
it has therefore not care to create a solid foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence with the basic technical protocols .
therefore , a traditional e-mail is an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; benni &quot; sends an e-mail , the host of the two are then connected directly ?
the e-mail program or the browser of anna sent the email to the mail server in the first step of their service provider .
for instance , if it has a gmail account , it would be google .
this mail server sends the content of the provider , uses the benni .
on the track , the mail can run on a number of other servers on the internet .
bennie can then call the content with their provider .
traditional e-mails are on their way through the network sniffing ?
most emails will be read by software robots several times along the way .
the provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail of a malicious program attached brings with it .
on the receiver systems will also be made to a virus-check .
also check the provider , whether we are talking about a troublesome and unwanted spam e-mail , the deleted in the same way , or at least in a spam folder wegsortiert will .
the robots have yet another task ?
on systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information that google needed for the placing of context-advertising .
when anna and benni communicate via gmail over their next holiday travel , google can dissolve offered corresponding links to leave .
also unknown people can read the e-mails with ?
the probability that unauthorized people hear a mail is extremely low .
in theory , it is possible .
in companies have often administrators the possibility that electronic mail reading .
the law enforcement agencies and intelligence services also have legal ways to intercept e-mails or to take note .
then there are possible ausspäh illegal actions .
is it possible to protect e-mails against the reduction ?
with an encryption after the openpgp standard can be encrypted thereby effectively against an e-mail .
with a high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that cannot even be detected without further ado , who communicated with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
used in the mainly private mailboxes , yahoo and google , according to a study of convios consulting play only a minor role in the august 2013 .
while the shares of yahoo mail were last fallen , gmail from google could rise significantly .
germany &apos;s biggest country church has launched an offensive to advertise for the job of the pastor .
background is a possible priest shortage : the protestant-lutheran country church hanover expects that will halve the number of its current 1,800 pastor home and pastors to present situation by 2030 .
for young people of today is the profession very attractive and offer good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to be able to choose the work and daily routine .
with burfien instructed the country church , for the first time , a pastor at a full point to inspire young people for the first time .
at present , fewer and fewer young people decide after graduating from high school to study theology .
burfien leads back to the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . &quot;
this is a career marked by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my schedule and can there my priorities , where it is important to me .
pastors could be close to the people as a chaplain .
they deserved as much as teachers and could well live on it .
no doubt will pay more in the free economy , but theologians would have a secure employer .
this will go to the young people of today that it is not just a career , but a meaningful work .
according to the national church , which includes three-quarters of lower saxony , currently go around 60 pastors per year in retirement .
at the same time start around 40 graduates of a theology studies her twenty- .
in sparsely populated and peripheral regions like the resin , emsland or wendland could , it will be difficult to fill posts .
burfien wants to hold study days for young people , among other things , and will also invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the first time offers a broad education .
you can even be that federal president .
hearing before the royal commission : two before allegations against ymca employee jonathan lord accused of sex offences
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children , before 2011 allegations were made against the child carers jonathan lord from caringbah , as the royal commission for sexual abuse of children learned .
but at the opening statement before the commission had declared the ymca , we have never had anything to do with an incident of sexual child abuse &quot; in the organization . &quot;
managing director phillip hare was asked about a case in which a ymca employees had been accused of offences with child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the ymca caringbah hall in 1991 had been convicted of abuse him anvertrauter children .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission assis animal lawyer that he had known of the first case , but the second was not known .
he admitted that the ymca &apos;s opening statement to the commission has also been inaccurate in the assertion that &quot; there have been external reviews of the ymca , in which the ymca was recognized as a front line in the children &apos;s safety . &quot;
evidence of the commission show instead that the ymca was informed that he was the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( ministry of education ) has received in august of this year .
hare , who has started 21 at the ymca , admitted that the management had &quot; failed to backward &quot; in the recruitment of lord of me and not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety .
lord , the beginning of the year had been convicted of sex offenses at 12 boys during his two-year career for the ymca .
he was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison .
hare denied , however , that the ymca had a cultural problem , have prevented the staff , lords to report offences in relation to the safety of children .
the staff said that they had observed violations , among other things , that he was alone with children , they privately supported as a baby sitter , they sit on his lap was to have said that he would like , and children play with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , whose boss lord was and had asked for a training to child protection , because she was concerned for his behavior , said of the children &apos;s services director jacqui barnat , the supervisors in the ymca caringbah the lords was , &quot; very daunting and most of the time was very remote . &quot;
the ceo said that he would not accept statements of employees that they could not be trusted to reimburse message to their superiors .
instead , he said , have affected their judgment on their friendship with lord , why they had not reported it .
hare said that he had informed the board of the ymca nsw his view that the lesson to draw from the &quot; jonathan lord incident &quot; that the organization , &quot; not the report &quot; by employees , according to the study , and the board voted to approve him .
hare said , the decision to push the employees to sign non-disclosure obligations shortly after the emergence of the allegations had been made by the director of the ymca of children &apos;s services , liam whitley , .
he said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented , but was &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw is not safe for children in the time when jonathan lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 there have been organization , said professor stephen small bone of griffith university , an expert on child sex abuse , the commission .
he explained that there had been &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , screening , training , training and supervision of employees .
the hearing was adjourned until december 20 .
tourism : descent to the romans
around 120 metres below cologne received a sewage canal from the roman era .
anyone who visits cologne , the cathedral is not over .
some 157 meters stand the two towers in the sky and make it to the second-highest church building in europe .
but only a few visitors who see the filigree two church towers , suspect that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral .
rainer schulze is an expert in the cologne underworld .
meeting point for his tours , the service center of cologne-tourism in front of the cathedral .
the tour begins very unspectacular : &quot; we start in the underground garage , &quot; says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city , and therefore remained from the remains of the ancient city wall only that stand , which was not too large .
most users of the park house rush past the roman remains so today , just ask your car .
but if you look more closely , discovered in the parking deck d2 a separated by metal mesh rods archaeological site .
on display are about five meters high ruins from palms large stones .
&quot; there are remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; says schulze .
before it comes back to the surface , the participants on the upper level was still take a look into a dark , 15 meters deep shaft .
this is the fountain of the old cathedral , which , unfortunately , is also hardly noticed .
next stop of the tour is the pretorian , and here the participants get back down into the depths .
here we see the official residence of the once powerful man north of the alps , the pre-gate of the ccaa .
what ccaa means , a visitor would like to know .
&quot; the acronym stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara aggripinensium , &quot; which was &quot; city of roman law and the agrippinenser city , in plain english , under emperor claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor worship &quot; means . &quot;
and the pretorian palace is the former proconsul , the centre of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
a tunnel leading from the foyer of the exhibition is getting access to the roman sewer , which is at around 120 metres .
&quot; you can go quietly along a stretch along the so-called cloaca maxima , if you want , &quot; encouraging schulze guests on .
schulze yet has a surprise .
after he has brought the key at the box office , he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep , walk-shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikvah , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he says .
the jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground , in order to get to the groundwater , which was essential for the songkran .
until today are in the lower end of the mikvah , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels by varying levels of the rhine legible .
the mikvah is part of an archaeological area on the town hall square for which the construction work would begin in the near future .
until the completion are but a few more years .
land rover rally series announced
the interior makes racing seats and six-point belts and a free intercom .
the options range from enhanced brakes , a service package with care by bowler-works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .
drew bowler , managing director of bowler motorsport , said : &quot; the rally customers that come on bowler have changed . &quot;
they are not all experienced riders , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , as well as an accessible way to world-class events .
we are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with land rover and the msa and believe that the format opens new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the uk and abroad and to prepare for newcomers to the hardships and the reality of rally raid .
we really had fun to develop the defender challenge car - it will be an entertaining championship .
there is also a training and test day at the defender challenge in february , as well as the option to participate in desert race in north africa and the middle east .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the election
a new day , a new horror story for independence .
this time we will be warned that an independent scotland is necessary to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this provides the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and along a secured with barbed wire border of hadrian &apos;s wall .
in fact , in the strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more travel in the rest of europe , but this - as expected - played no role in the headlines .
no one has also mentioned that the eu member states often bent to its strict rules when it is convenient for them .
since scotland currently does not belong to the schengen area , the continued disregard for brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the scots .
that is not really a story .
and one that already has been the case in the years that they already have a fossil resembles : the first time i have heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; -ente at least 40 years ago .
this is an interesting point lost in the constant refrain of this ancient history .
why should we expect of an independent scotland , that dances to the tune of europe ?
why the london yoke against the trade of brussels , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the large , taken after the war plan to the unification of europe is faltering .
with the euro crisis , the european project is officially dead .
parties win anywhere in the eu are hostile in soil , the eu or want to jettison the euro as a common currency .
even in germany , the euro-sceptic party alternative for germany - founded until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in september for themselves get and thus effectively distribute the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) from the bundestag .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis turns out as a turning point .
because of the strict austerity in connection with the straitjacket imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in which the national economy is forced by the adherence to the common currency , many people are of the opinion that the european project had gone too far .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has nailed its members on exchange rates , which are good for german exporters - and that german politicians would like to leave it that way .
without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency , southern europe is again with a built-in productivity disadvantage against germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred by berlin .
behind the current etat- and currency problems lies a deeper european productivity problem .
as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by brussels - a code for the subsidy of french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers - pays the european industry compared with the united states twice for electricity and four times for gas .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen already in grange mouth .
the european petrochemical industry does not protect all wage-writing courses in the world before , from cheap us shale gas to be pushed into a corner .
as a result , a revolt up , especially in france , the eu &apos;s former cheerleader .
after the war saw the french political elite could lift the eu as a vehicle with which to keep germany in check and paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a gateway to the political legitimacy and europe has imposed its own economic policy , by which the ailing french economy is struggling .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , eu-hostile national front has just won a decisive choice and referred to the ruling socialists at number three .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the british labour party that they cannot assume a split in the right range would automatically mean benefits for the left .
what makes le pen , with its newly gained popularity among the white working-class french ?
they would like to use the eu elections next year to forge an anti-eu , anti-common currency bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties in these elections do well - and this is very possible - then could dominate the european parliament for the first time such a block .
this is the point that i am going with this : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like something like the &quot; europe of nations ( sovereign ) &quot; which favored general de gaulle .
germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect that britain distanced itself from this project in the hope that the united states look presidential .
however , washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain will be in the atlantic rain alone .
where is scotland in all of this ?
we can choose to be a region of ( in the last consequence ) little england .
or we can defend our own economic interests - including , berlin and brussels to say what they are where hinstecken can .
i suspect that scotland could go very well in a looser european network , if we keep our own currency .
the cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a federal europe of the nations .
otherwise , we should consider it replicate norway and keep our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in europe and has won a spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed ( and ) cuts carried out in 2011 , the labour chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling and the subsequent tory-lib dem coalition had to answer for .
it would be ridiculous to decide now for an independence for scotland , only to be imposed on an austerity from berlin and brussels .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices on planes ( but no mobile phone calls )
passengers can now use their electronic devices for reading , work , games , music and the image of films from the departure to the landing , but not with the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines , which were issued on thursday by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in the united states .
but the passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented , drawn by the respective airline , faa employee michael huerta said at a press conference .
the airlines , the faa must prove that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for flight crew , as well as the rules for the storage of the devices in accordance with the new rules .
the faa said that they have already received by some airlines plans that would expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
under these airlines were also delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the state of the plan we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the faa announced in a statement .
currently , passengers must switch smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .
they can only restart them when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain is the green light .
enter the landing the passengers need to disable them again and cannot run again , before the plane landed .
under the new guidelines could allow airlines , whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions , their passengers to use the equipment in the launch and landing on the tarmac , the faa said .
most new commercial aircraft and other pilots who were converted into greater heights for the use of wi-fi should meet the criteria .
laura glading , president of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new regulation is implemented safely , and we are working closely with the airline together in this regard , both sides will benefit from it , &quot; glading said .
we are sincerely sorry , we have to feel like watchdogs on this issue .
however , internet connections for surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data still banned under three kilometres , explained the authority .
passengers will be asked to make smart phones , tablets and other devices in the flight mode .
that is still not &quot; words with friends , &quot; a scrabble extensive online game , which the actor alec baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave an american airlines jet high profile , because he refused to shut down the device , while the plane was parked at the gate .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored , because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not the faa .
faa lifts may ban for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
last month by the transportation security administration , national transportation safety board , mark rosenker said , security expert for national transport issues at cbs news , mobile phones were still seen as a risk .
&quot; mobile is really a problem , not only because they could cause potential problems in navigation devices , but because we know from the fcc that the transfer from the air can also disrupt transmission towers , &quot; said rosenker .
an advisory committee of the industry , which was launched by the faa to investigate this issue , last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years , increased the pressure on the faa to loosen restrictions on its use .
critics such as the democratic senator claire during from missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous .
in some studies , mentions that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the closure of the device .
the faa began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by means of passengers unlocks fm radios were known at the time were the latest technology trends .
new aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the faa that electronic interference account for nothing .
airline passengers for several years already offer wi-fi , if the altitude is reached .
the flyer adapted to wi-fi systems are also more insensitive to interference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines , huerta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-reader , for example , give only minimal radiation , if one umblättert .
but when they download data or send the transfer values are stronger .
one of the advocates of an easing of restrictions on use of the devices by passengers amazon.com .
2011 invited firm employees a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to determine problems , but could not say .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed feelings , with regard to the risk in the use of devices .
douglas kidd of the passenger association national association of airline passengers said that he is of the view that the disruption of the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who spoke for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
the committee recommended the faa , however , allow pilots to order the closure of the devices by the passengers in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would comprehensively equipped with technology .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in contradiction to safety , &quot; said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .

freudenstadt : quick action twist hosts
with a narrow cadres had the gentlemen i tsv freudenstadt in the schiller-school gym in reutlingen play against the tg gönningen of the swabian alb .
the Älbler stood side by side with an experienced team on the other network .
soon showed , however , that , also due to old age , they could not compete with the quick action of city dwellers of joy .
with the hard and placed crashes did the gönninger is extremely difficult .

they provided a competitive two-hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused mainly by the ball adoption errors and points gifts ; also in the passports was the precision sometimes scarce and in some critical game prevented scenes of over-eagerness to look for possible point gains .
a very balanced encounter in this performance , the tsv team of marcus blasutto agreed but all the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams .
gechingen : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the people at an early stage in the planning , &quot; mayor jens häußler opened to the public information event for flood protection gechingen concept .
about 80 participants were in the town hall had to explain the planned measures for you to ask questions to express concerns and ideas .
häußler was clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions by the members of the parish council . &quot;
the flooding that gechingen on may 15 , 2009 , unprepared , had been a crucial event , which raised the question of protective measures for the future , so häußler .
a basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring village s1 , which is now the basis for the flood protection gechingen concept .
&quot; as the protection of cultivated land is the goal , &quot; so häußler .
the basis is the planning of protection against a flood expected according to the german weather service in every 100 years of statistics .
climate change will be met by a 15-percent surcharge .
in expert circles , this with &quot; hq 100a climate . &quot;
the mass of water that 2009 had led to considerable damage in gechingen matched a 1,000-year flood .
&quot; it is not an absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve , &quot; so häußler .
in order to achieve the protection hq 100a climate , must be invested in gechingen around four million euros , and the community can expect country to shots to the tune of around 70 percent .
häußler but pointed out that it will only give the promotion if a master plan implemented .
this is dependent on the participation of the citizens of the municipality .
an elaborate planning and approval procedures should be is completed .
in the best case , 2016 could be started with the implementation .
among other things , provides for the protection concept that has already been presented in the past week in the local council ( we ) reported local measures in the flow of the river irm from the stammheimer valley .
at the end of the presentation of the concept of flood protection , the participants used the opportunity to introduce their concerns .
among other things , questioned why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the place .
gregor kühn , designer of the forest and corbe commissioned engineering firms from hillside home , who presented the concept , stressed that it needs the cooperation of all introduced measures in order to achieve the desired objective in the sum .
moreover , it is required to find the most economical solution , as joachim forest of forest and corbe .
dissatisfaction reigned for operators of altorts that even in normal thunderstorm rain continues to suffer from an overload of the canal network .
the problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken .
häußler pointed out , however , that the guidelines for sewer systems are different , as for the flood protection and this should not be mixed .
the community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that two to three-year rain events could cope with .
the sewers have larger dimensions , would waste millions .
the newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe .
one , to stay and come back again .
one thing that would make the name on the program .
be described as déjà vu , according to lexicon , a psychological phenomenon that is in a sense , a new situation to have ever seen or experienced .
in the case of the visit of the eponymous cafes in the district town on opschlag successor in sight at the hochschule rhine-waal , it must not remain at the pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the cafe with the beautiful name aimed at just that : a real stay not only intellectually , but to make hand always experience the pulse .
it &apos;s very fun and is simply beautiful .
a look into the inner life on opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the first attempt .
the state-of-the-art , but not cool cafe-style looks like a place to relax .
here , the team with the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top of the guest with a wide variety of coffee or cocktail variants .
there &apos;s delicious cakes or individually made fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have made a name for himself before the opening of the picturesque cafes on the opschlag as restaurateurs : in kranenburg , they held the &quot; art lounge . &quot;
the move after a staunch supporter of the opschlag hope the coffee-lovers more sympathetic audience .
last but not least by the university .
&quot; while we do not have a specific target , &quot; said daniel büttner .
instead , the two would like to raise young students in the same way as seniors and all ages in between .
apropos cafe-lovers .
the friendly owner few stands behind the coffee-drinking .
the fragrant hot brew enjoys itself in various forms .
expressofan
daniel büttner is rather the expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt the cappuccino-drinking woman .
&quot; a baguette - this is my thing , &quot; she tells the nrz .
two events there &apos;s even in bright cafe .
rather one .
because if the port festival took place outside - the café déjà vu benefited not of it .
but there was also the stripy natz evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny , &quot; found the two 33-year-olds .
but not for everybody .
perhaps daniel büttner is therefore not a great fan of event evenings : &quot; it &apos;s of course not all of the time . &quot;
and with an event , i always speak only those who are also interested in the special event .
for this reason , events will be the exception rather for us .
&quot; we want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible . &quot;
should read : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products , which are offered here , as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at opschlag in destroyed .
the street , which is more and more developed into a gastronomy mile .
to the delight of many klever , guests from near and far , and students who discover the gastro mile and thus the café déjà vu for themselves .

jumbo manufacturers contend in the face of large orders on seat width
it is between leading aircraft manufacturers have come to a dispute about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights , which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the dubai airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the seat width , the passengers on long flights will be offered in the tourist class - not always the ones that airlines are the most , but this proven space is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft from boeing co. and airbus sas .
airbus claimed this week an industry standard , which requires a minimum seat width of 46 centimeters ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us erzrivale boeing says that the airlines should decide .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builder vying to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flights , and in the event of 17 to 21 november expect record orders .
as the rear part of the aircraft is structured - in particular , whether there are rows with nine or ten seats , is crucial to the economic results , which should provide the new &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; design .
boeing claims that its modernized &quot; 777x &quot; shall be 406 people in seats in economy class , which are more than 17 inches wide and so allow ten per line .
airbus said , the competing version of the a350 car 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class , and there are nine per line .
aircraft giants share often blows on technical details by means of advertising in the trade press .
now , airbus before the dubai airshow , where the 777x with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race , appeals directly to the public .
the company recently placed an ad , which could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture , in which three people squeezed sitting in a restaurant , and the title : &quot; would you accept that ? &quot;
&quot; boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats , which are narrower than regional turbo-prop aircraft , &quot; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
in the face of changed eating habits are the people thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the average american male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent , according to the data of the us health ministry .
the taillenumfang of the male average american in the 21st century , according to us health statistics 100.8 cm .
airbus says that his rival would take a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body was the scope of the newly baptized &quot; jet set &quot; narrow .
we have , as airbus , the analysis showed that an additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat is lowering the quality of sleep by 53 percent .
boeing disputes the figures to the headquarters of airbus moderation and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide the balance between air fares , as airlines and interior design .
the company also said , according to research from the experience depends on the plane over the seat width .
&quot; it is really important , airlines to provide flexibility , so that they can do this , what they have in their view , in order to be successful , &quot; explains the flight cabin expert kent craver of boeing .
they do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , it is more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers , it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales .
behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting effect on the export performance of the us or europe .
as reuters reported in july for the first time , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .
both airbus and boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its latest two-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat boeing 77-300er .
boeing &apos;s statements on the results depend , in part , for the 777x is compared with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per line .
&quot; boeing squeezes therefore more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products , &quot; says kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort in the european airbus .
on the other hand , say analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement , which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares .
&quot; eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus offer controlled by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said mary kirby , an expert for cabin no direction , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines can choose .
the passenger jet salesman world have even tape measure in itself , in order to give the establishment in the competition .
even if they advertise the comfort , but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus offers a ten-seat a350 series , but has not yet sold , according to his own words .
until recently , airbus has stressed how important is more adaptability of cabins and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle , but could distract from the wave of 777x-sales .
the vegan , according to dictionaries under the vegetarianism , differs from this , but in a very significant way .
because while vegetarians will allow the consumption of cream cake , ice cream or a strong edam , these gourmet shops are not on the menu of a veganers .
in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish , milk , cheese , egg , leaves the vegan from all consumption of animal products - including honey is denied .
what remains , you may ask , but on closer inspection , the vegan diet is world through a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; sandwich spreads are very popular , &quot; said ute henkel mann , the owner of the local reform house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor , too , will be happy to visit the store in the domgasse .
for 13 years , the native new zealanders vegan , in water , he is ( almost ) everything , what he needs to life . &quot; in 1997 , i was in my diet and became a vegetarian . &quot;
around the turn of the century , then the next step and i became a vegan .
&quot; the conviction , but not only because of the food , but because of the shoe choice , &quot; says proctor , who prefers artificial leather normal leather .
he realized that this is also in other everyday concerns without animal products .
first and foremost is vegan be an ethics .
&quot; i do not want animals have to die for me , &quot; says proctor , the maxim of vegans , which extends to the entire consumer behaviour .
instead of burgers , dated or rubber bear behind to grieve , have increased the vegan quickly discovered in new products , the enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proctor today , &quot; in fact , vegan be no surrender , no asceticism , but it is an asset . &quot; the assumption that it leads with the diet of the selection of dining options externalities , proctor rather on the power of habit .
and this very conditioning also left some well-intentioned attempts fail .
&quot; the addiction is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly , as with smoking , &quot; proctor is a comparison .
and if a &quot; certain tastes are not the animal . &quot;
often it is the spices or the kind of preparation , which make up the taste .
&quot; you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; shows the vegan .
at a barbecue festival brings proctor , for example , eggplant , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages with .
he is committed to a balanced and varied diet , in which it is supposed to taste even proper .
of course , we would like to have something between the teeth , which is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but that is not only to reduce animal food , &quot; said proctor .
health damage to eating disorders , another widespread adoption , he had not suffered .
for me , the conversion had a positive side .
i am not a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamins .
there are high-performance athletes who are exclusively vegan diet .
&quot; my blood values are well , i am often check , &quot; proctor reveals .
in particular , many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin b12 .
&quot; as animals are fed with animal feed , rather than on the pasture to graze , it is questionable whether the vitamin b12 share in the flesh , which buys it in the freezer , is high , &quot; proctor will take place .
there is also the possibility that nicotine in the form of pills to take him for a vegan .
&quot; my b12-values are in order , &quot; he says .
long distances to proctor does not go to the food supply .
basic foodstuffs are finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .
i think everything that i need on the ground .
i only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; a lot of people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive , but it is also known for &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products . &quot;
in any case , is the preparation veganer courts far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the kitchen of the house , with a few small tips can be good , if not better results in part , &quot; proctor said .
margarine instead of butter , a bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheesecake proctor could also bring his in-laws in wonder .
family firm adds a new spice of the vegan .
the dynamic is that if you cook together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise in this are as diverse as the people themselves , &quot; proctor said .
of course he was also shown already skepticism .
no longer tastes you my food ?
&quot; should i now feel bad , because i drink milk ? &quot; - on such issues , we must act as a vegan tact .
&quot; i do not reject the people , i am part of this society , &quot; like proctor no enclaves being confined .
strikes and looked at the everyday world then not so vegan foreign as suspects - and the vegan not as restricted as commonly believed in everyday life .
fast food is also allowed .
fries are everywhere !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel at , or just a vegetarian yufka , &quot; proctor said .
he is in a pizzeria on pasta dishes , or order a pizza without cheese , everything is a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slowly to be prepared for it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago to feed my vegan , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the new zealanders can find a development : &quot; talk to people , they warn . &quot;
&quot; if sufficient demand , they are perhaps inclined to complement the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegane restaurants develop , such as the galley in mannheim or café bird-free .
proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least one veganes court are on the menu .
in fact , vegan dishes are there for everyone .
anyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are against this exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they are different from , &quot; proctor said .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part from the outset impossible , &quot; proctor said .
but the shopping veganer products could be rather difficult at the beginning .
especially if you can learn to understand that &apos;s also contain animal additives in peanuts as a color donor , seems to leave you with the courage of the ethics compliance with so many hurdles and traps .
not only have reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives , &quot; explains the many ingredients that are buried food and cleaning products .
&quot; gradually developed a scanner views and white , in which characters and logos to respect you , &quot; it is sometimes better small steps to do than stop or stumble , &quot; proctor knows .
the veganism , he is an important moral finger show that proposes on awareness .
perhaps he creates it not quite that one rediscovers his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critical .
bavaria &apos;s player optimistic despite the first defeat
even the first defeat in the euro league could not diminish the huge optimism in the basketballern fc bayern munich .
&quot; no one can forbid us to believe that , even against the best team in europe to win the last two years , &quot; summing bayern coach sveti lav pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on thursday evening with defending champions league two port vale piraeus .
we have sent the message : also exists in munich basketball !
at their first third appearance in europe &apos;s premier class sold the munich is very well for a long time , were in the decisive stages but simply not clear enough .
the guests managed to convert the piece of art , a 15-point gap , 13 minutes before the end , in a leadership first , before piraeus was a turning point of the game again .
&quot; we have incredible fought back against the two-time league champion , but then again careless mistakes , &quot; said bayern-professional yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
malcolm delaney and nihad djedovic were the most successful launchers of munich , the series champion in the first two games against italy &apos;s monte paschi siena and the polish title winner zielona góra significant victories were celebrated .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking of the oxygen
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun on smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine cravings for a lifetime .
further tests are needed before tests on humans , which may take a few more years , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college in new york said the first results were good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can even help millions of smokers who tried to quit smoking and have tried all methods available on the market , but had to witness that nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , &quot; said cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies .
the virus infected selectively the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , causing a smoker is not a nicotine-high .
in experiments vaccinated mice , which was administered nicotine , retained their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a &quot; break &quot; , said the researchers , a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains .
the experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .
the vaccinations had to be made to maintain the antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical .
but the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , could be a future vaccine for people , if he is sure to be administered to children , before they came into temptation to try a cigarette , and thus prevent nicotine addiction .
more likely , however , is that smokers would use him to quit .
&quot; they know that if they re-start to smoke , they feel no more pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to abandon the habit , &quot; he explained .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but warned at the same time , there is still a need for more research .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot convinced with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details , however , is also heavier fare than necessary .
the france of the 1760er years playing action tells the poignant story of suzanne , a young nobleman who is sent by her family in a monastery .
rebel than they , it is faced with an extremely sadistic mother superior of the extreme cruelty and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film glides never in chandelier intimacy or sensationalism , and therein lies his problem .
the solemn seriousness with which the film , makes it even for the audience to quälerischen hair shirt .
egypt sworn first freely elected president
mohammed morsi sets their oath of office , but his day of triumph will not mean the end of the political disputes in egypt .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt , &quot; when he was sworn in as the country &apos;s first freely elected president , and thus took up the succession of hosni mubarak , who had been driven from office 16 months earlier .
with his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also the arab world &apos;s first freely elected islamist president and egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 judges of the court , which has its seat on the nile dressed in black robes and is inspired by an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; morsi said at the ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said the 60-year-old morsi , a trained engineer and a member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group in the united states , the most since its inception 84 years ago as a banned organization had been targeted by the respective government sharply .
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building , as morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to the new president zuzujubeln , and in contrast to the presidential pomp from the mubarak era , the traffic was stopped for a short time , so that the auto convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street , which connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .
as uncharismatisches &quot; spare tire &quot; of the brotherhood mocked his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the islamists , but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian mubarak to your destination .
&quot; egypt is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state today , &quot; said the judges in the wood-panelled chamber of morsi dressed in a blue suit with a red tie , his oath of office in august .
morsi later went to the university of cairo , where he should keep his inaugural speech .
he was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem , which he listened to in habachtstellung .
the military leader field marshal hussein tantawi was present .
on his arrival he was greeted with chanting , &quot; the army and the people are one hand &quot; of hundreds of those present in the main auditorium of the university .
the cairo university built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education has become a stronghold of islamist student groups in the 1970s .
morsi presented on friday a symbolic oath in tahrir square , the birthplace of the uprising , which led to the end of mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers , which the scaf had taken over from the hunted leader from office .
but with the drop of the official oath before the court and not as usual before parliament prevents it is the will of the military , which shows that the power struggle will continue .
morsi &apos;s speech on the tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .

frontier airlines collects fees for hand luggage
frontier airlines plans to ask for up to 100 dollars of passengers who want to store on their flight hand luggage .
frontier airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if to read in the announcement on wednesday was that passengers are likely to keep the whole box .
the new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment on the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
frontier said that you calculate 25 us dollars , if the fee will be paid in advance , and $ 100 for passengers who paid only at the gate .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos;malley said that the fee of $ 100 is geared towards that , to move travelers to care in the run-up to the payment .
&quot; we do not want this sum charge , &quot; she said .
airlines began to demand that , for the first and second checked baggage fees in 2008 .
passengers who have tried to circumvent them so plugged into the hand luggage as much as possible , with the result that the baggage compartments on the seat are often overcrowded .
fees are a way to persuade passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;malley said that with the new fee , it was not really trying to make money .
they go to the most loyal customers of frontier , which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist on the seat .
passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline , do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger at the gate of frontier , under certain circumstances , can take a piece of luggage for free , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a similar baggage .
o &apos;malley said , the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the gate .
the new hand baggage fee of frontier enters into force only in the summer , an exact date is not yet there .
passengers often grumble about baggage surcharges and other fees , but airlines like to take it back .
they argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay the service if they wanted him .
many on wall street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most have so far , however , the finger of charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc. demanded three years before the first charges for hand luggage and later followed all giant air , also a low-cost airlines .
the only other airline with such a fee is the hungarian wizz air , said the airline consultant jay sorensen , closely followed by the additional fees .
he estimated in a report in december 2011 that the hand baggage fee equals spirit of us $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , who previously held a leadership position in midwest airlines , has recently flown with spirit and was curious to know what he would expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company &apos;s unusual hand baggage fee .
&quot; the boarding process was one of the most fluid , which i have seen in my career in aviation , &quot; he said .
i expected to see gnashing and vehement discussions at the gate .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and the boarding ran as lubricated . &quot;
frontier spirit will also be asked for $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
the company said that passengers who bought juice or lemonade are likely to keep the whole can and will be filled with coffee for free .
water is still free of charge .
us airways had tried for a short time in 2008 to demand money for soft drinks , had made it back seven months later , after passengers complained and was pulled after no other major company .
frontiers step to collect fees for the hand baggage , if passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative , with the customer should be drawn to the website .
airlines pay online travel agencies like orbitz $ 10 to 25 / sold ticket .
that all societies provides an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than an online travel agency .
frontier has gone furthest in this area , however .
in september , the company began to book through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles to forgive .
on wednesday , the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route again .
a flight booked with a third party about 1,000 miles with frontier brings customers therefore only 250 miles .
passengers can also reserve exclusively at the direct purchase on the website of frontier places .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds went back to 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter , as can be read in the financial report , which was published by the parent company , republic airways holdings inc . , on wednesday .
republic has tried to get a grip on the finances of frontier as part of the sale of the company .

john kerry said in an unprecedented acknowledgement that the us spy is &quot; inappropriate gone too far &quot;
john kerry indicated with an unexpected admission of a slackening of the defensive attitude of the united states in terms of their surveillance programs , saying that the espionage has gone too far in certain cases &quot; inappropriate . &quot;
the foreign minister , in addition to that he bore the responsibility that we have switched on &quot; autopilot &quot; together with barack obama , as the explosive revelations of the whistleblowers edward snowden were publicly about the nsa &apos;s spying activities .
the leaked information , the us government is caught in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .
in a speech transmitted by video link at the open government conference in london , kerry said , &quot; without question the president and i and others in the government have experienced by some things that are expired almost on autopilot , simply because there was the ability to do so , even to the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war and , of course , dates from the 11th of september . &quot;
he then acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the us government that the us espionage have crossed a line , also stressed that no rights had been abused .
he said : &quot; it is inappropriate in some cases have gone too far . &quot;
the president is determined to create clarity , and therefore leads through a thorough investigation , so no one has to have the feeling here find abuse took place .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa was a force for good and through its surveillance operations had been saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to break itself into the air . &quot;
there is a radical extremism in the world , the crazy point is to kill people , to break into the air and attacking governments .
what would be , if you would be able to intercept it and to stop before it happens ?
we have , in fact , plane crashes , prevent attacks on buildings and the killing of people , because we have experienced in the run-up to such plans .
meanwhile , us lawmakers will travel to europe in order to allay the concerns against the alleged american espionage and to convince the europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the united states , in anti-terror efforts , such as the chairman of the senate committee on european affairs said on thursday .
senator chris murphy of connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the european parliament and others and is no longer concerned about their threats because of frustration with the surveillance by the national security agency to take part in anti-terror organizations .
&quot; it is very important for the national security interests of the united states that the europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism , &quot; said murphy , who sits as a democrat for the first time in the senate and as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and european affairs , in an interview in washington .
i go to europe , in order to make it clear that we need to continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the nsa programs .
media reports that the nsa has collected millions of phone data in europe , have strained relations with some u.s. allies , although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the meta data collected by nato allies and had been exchanged with the united states .
other revelations quoted from documents provided by snowden further that the nsa had monitored the cell phone of german chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other leaders around the world .
the director of national intelligence , james clapper , defended the spying on allies as necessary and explained that this is common on both sides .
in all the uproar , murphy said , his bureau before the journey of the congress , which will take place this year , and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members are to be published in the next few days .
he said that the exact itinerary will be worked out .
while murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement of relations , said he also said that there would be some &quot; serious words &apos; .
he said that the european governments need to be honest with their people on the kind of espionage programs that use them for years .
&quot; although we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of europeans , but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones that spy , &quot; says murphy .
meanwhile stands for john kerry over the weekend and a trip to the middle east to poland to deal with the resentment over the us strategy in syria , egypt and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities there .

clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott have conflict with parental leave
the billionaire and mp clive palmer says that prime minister tony abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it .
the mining magnate , which is located in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , made the claim when he wanted to wipe the issues on the table , whether he is in a conflict .
the palmer united party could control up to four votes in the senate , which are important for the decision , whether the carbon and mining taxes will be eliminated or reduced .
but palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of abbott personally would benefit from the laws .
&quot; he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest , whether or not they receive holiday , &quot; palmer said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission palmer with 53 votes ahead after the recount officially to the winner of the sunshine coast seat of fairfax .
palmer called for a review of the process of counting for this to go faster .
tony third daughters frances and bridget .
these elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why should we have no system , in which one in marches , enters the data into a computer , immediately selects and then at 6 : 30 p.m. the result ?
palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot .
to use it , because then you can wipe the results , if they do not like ?
today to vote with pencils is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , said that an international airport for the sunshine coast belong to his policy and that he will take his new post &quot; very serious &quot; .
in a public office go to the service to the public .
&quot; we strive for no reward except the history , namely , that we can serve in a critical period of this community , &quot; he said .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billion
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .
30 proposals were to choose from , five are still in the race .
distant worlds .
more than 1000 planet with other stars , astronomers have already found .
whether there is life on some of them at least , nobody knows .
the selection is difficult : are we to look for gravitational waves ?
or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or search for planets within a billion years and thus perhaps discover alien life ?
these questions are the leaders of the european space agency esa .
for its programme &quot; cosmic vision &quot; they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research .
the budget for such &quot; l-missions &quot; each is approximately one billion euros .
the launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of september , the elite of the european space research met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them are now come in the final round .
many bodies examine the proposals , push for the researchers .
in the next few days a final decision by the scientific program committee should fall .
a total of four major issues , the esa has selected on the missions of the programme initiated in 2007 &quot; cosmic vision &quot; to find answers .
what are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
the exact transactions in the birth of stars from major gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting the star - are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
and when a star has planets , under what circumstances can result in life ?
to investigate this matter , is due to start in 2017 , the space telescope &quot; last &quot; with the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity to be examined in detail .
the possibilities are limited , his is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments could astronomers first step planet map and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that apply as an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system ?
this question , too , is ultimately intended to indicate what conditions there are for the emergence of life .
plays an important role the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the particle radiation emitted by him with the planetary system .
in our solar system , you can examine these events as an example .
with the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; the esa has already approved the budget for a mission of the m-class ( there is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe is expected to start in 2017 and closely monitor surface and activity of the sun .
also of great interest to the researchers are jupiter and its moons .
they want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
for this , the esa provides for the first of the three l-missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its journey to 2022 .
eight years later , it reaches jupiter and is designed to study the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the icy moons europa , ganymede and kallisto .
what are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid .
perhaps also found discrepancies that physicists could point the way to a new theory , under whose umbrella to unite all known laws .
what is the universe created and what is it ?
13.7 billion years ago our universe created by the big bang .
in addition to the household matter to us from the stars , planets and life as we are , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , whose work is accelerating the expansion of the universe .
so far the researchers know not what physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the big bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy remain .
with &quot; euclid , &quot; the esa has also has already approved a m-mission , whose launch is scheduled for 2020 .
with a special telescope to study the probe of the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and allow such conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
only two of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection process .
the best chance for a permit as l-mission , in the opinion of many experts &quot; e-lisa , &quot; an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves .
including physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time that albert einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago .
to this day , they do not have been proven .
elisa could do this , the scientists behind the project hope .
the mission provides for a detector of two or three probes , which is stationed in space .
he could , in contrast to plants on earth , prove gravitational waves that have emerged from the big bang , and provide new insights about the formation of the universe .
four other proposals still compete at the second l mission : a large x-ray telescope called athena , &quot; which , among other things , is to explore black holes , &quot; icy planets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; prism , &quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; exoplanet finder , &quot; the first step is to detect and investigate planets .
already eliminated include proposals for sample-return transport from the exploration of the moon , mars , venus and asteroids as well as solar physics .
cdc publish allergy guidelines for schools
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) published on wednesday a set of guidelines for the treatment of children with food allergies in schools .
these are the first such guidelines issued by the american government has , since the number of school children with food allergies is on the rise .
one in 20 children in the united states now has a food allergy .
according to the cdc , the distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools , the faculty and staff are to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools Еще have in stock - the car-injection of the epipen brand is most commonly used - in order to deal with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Еще simple stock .
the report is also a list of typical symptoms that are mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .
children may say : &quot; it feels as if something is on my tongue , &quot; &quot; my tongue feels as if it is a hair on it , &quot; or &quot; my tongue smile . &quot;

u.s. border : &quot; super-tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling , discovered
on the border between mexico and the united states , investigators have discovered a &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling and shut down .
as the us customs told , the more than 500 meters long tube between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and a ventilation system .
three suspects have been arrested so , eight tons of marijuana , and seized nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine .
the tunnel , according to the data has not yet been taken into use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could by digging under the radar , &quot; said the prosecutor-general of the u.s. district of southern california , laura duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in san diego , where one end of the tunnel had been discovered .
written to the drug gangs assured duffy : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and tried to use it , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77 000 people in connection with the drug crime were killed in mexico .
designed by experts
because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers , and that the construction took about a year to complete .
the railway track was so equipped that could be used in electric-powered cars .
on the mexican side is the access in a building , which is 80 meters away from the border .
according to authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width .
he would have been suitable with it in order to encourage illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-fund .
the third party , a mexican , was taken as a result of marijuana confiscated .
all three face a maximum sentence of life-long imprisonment , as officials said .
since 2006 were eight such tunnels have been discovered , said at the press conference in san diego .
but it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a slump .
usually , cocaine smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said bill sherman of the dea drug investigation in san diego .
they would do everything to get to the united states .
no details have been announced to the detainees , at least one is mexicans , they said .
they must reckon with prison sentences of up to 10 years .
obama &apos;s withdrawal in health policy
after intense criticism , president obama yesterday backed down on his often repeated , clear promise : &quot; if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands from their insurers have received a termination letter , republicans cast the president in recent days that he had misled the american public .
yesterday relativistic gave obama his original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of the people who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the many media reports about the dismissals , obama called on those americans who have received such messages , will look for a new insurance on the open market .
most people could get a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than forecast .
&quot; they get a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government described it as no surprise that the five percent of the population , have completed the self-insurance , would have to look for another rate since their contract does not meet the new standards under the affordable care act .
&quot; i would say directly to these americans : you deserve , &quot; said liu &apos;s stands at a hearing before the house energy and commerce committee in washington .
liu &apos;s stands , which is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care act , said that the launch of the online platform had been &quot; abysmal &quot; since october .
&quot; i am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , &quot; she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
these words of liu &apos;s disgruntled stands to a seated behind her manager at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives was taken after a dispute with the republican members billy long from missouri . it was whether it should be obliged to participate in obamacare .
after more than three hours hearing hassled long stands liu &apos;s repeatedly with the question , why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care act did not voluntarily relinquished a state-sponsored insurance in order to complete a fare at health care .gov themselves that they now wanted to sell millions of americans .
parents of inter-sexual children can choose &quot; gender vague . &quot;
germany is the first european nation , in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals .
newborn will no longer rigidly assigned to male or female .
under the new law , parents must declare no more sex for such children , but can specify &quot; vague &quot; or &quot; no limit &quot; on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents , so that they do not have to make hasty decisions in terms of operations for a gender assignment in newborns , and to fight against the discrimination of inter-sexual people .
an inter-sexual person said according to the bbc years later : &quot; i am neither man nor woman . &quot;
i stand by the patchwork , which was created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is not a boy or a girl to the world .
they belong to the inter-sexual , a group that fall under the diagnosis of &quot; sexual differentiation disturbance &quot; ( dsd ) , an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovary or testis ) or unusually developed genitals .
wallis simpson was possibly inter sexually .
the understanding of the gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts advise to do so in the united states , you should use the best available information on gender assignment , if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child , before you decide - if at all - for an operation .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new german law &quot; it for a good cause . &quot;
inter-sexual children represent an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical operation , but for most children are not , &quot; he said .
we can make a gender assignment without surgery , and then to see how to develop the identity .
the scientific data about how a child ever developed its gender identity are not very accurate .
no one knows why it happens .
it is like the mystery of why people are gay .
in a report to the european commission for the year 2011 states that inter-sexual people are different from transsexual and transgender people , because their status is not gender-related , but due to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively male or female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .
these properties were in for tier sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones .
the report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced the inter-sexual , and transgender people in the workplace , as well as on the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .
not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp .
it is now possible on official documents indicate male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; for adults in australia and nepal .
in june , australians norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world &apos;s first &quot; gender-free &quot; person , after a court had granted the lifetime maintenance of an &quot; unspecified &quot; gender status .
german cards have a third allocation in the future as well as m and w , x for inter sexually , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighboring france are gender issues still controversial , as a news story on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strict catholic country signed a petition that the &quot; gender theory &quot; should be removed from school books .
the us catholic online web site has also spoken out against the german law , on the grounds that &quot; if the world is dragged into a new state , where the sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two other pillars of civilization . &quot;
the mother of a newborn from maryland told baby zone , they think it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned to a sex .
&quot; the parents &apos; life is stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if we do not know the sex of their child , &quot; she told the parents &apos; website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who were born with both male and female sex parts , were described as hermaphroditen , after the greek god , who had both sexes .
a decade ago , the medicine viewed the sex as something that could wipe out one and then rebuild .
but in the meantime will be questioned the ethical foundations of an operation that is now known , how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also are wrong , because they do not know how the child feels in upbringing with the gender allocated by them .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century called it a , psychiatric emergency &quot; , &quot; drescher said .
if such a child was born , then , is not a psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to dr. john money of johns hopkins university , who took the view that the sex was malleable .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued , social and environmental initiatives , as the parents educate a child , interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person see as male or female .
but , in a case known as the &quot; john / joan &quot; from 1966 , his theories were controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision , the child not to immobilised them and also to remove his testicles and then pull him as a big girl .
&quot; money was presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , which he is not , &quot; says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he committed suicide .
according to the drescher , there are still physicians who would practice this model .
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , are survivors of this sex operations stepped to the public that &quot; are not happy with the result . &quot;
such as jim bruce , a 36-year-old writer from montana , who was born with xy-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .
the doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life as a man .
so were its external body and testicles surgically removed shortly after the birth in 1976 and he was taken as a big girl .
at the age of 12 he received female hormones .
&quot; i knew that i am not a girl , &quot; he said on abcnews.com
i was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he should receive a vaginal plastic .
but because he was depressed and knew something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found was shocking .
i was sterilized at my birth - and no one has ever said that to me .
bruce was born with a dsd , could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals through his body .
after he had told the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections and was to remove his breasts .
as a result of the operation , he has become infertile .
today he fights for others in an organization called interface project for sexual people are perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the rights group based in california advocates for informed choice , is concerned that the german law &quot; to stamp and stigmatize encourage &quot; could .
&quot; many activists are worried that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and allocate a , not determined &quot; to the child , &quot; she said .
we fear that favours intervention .
we think that it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait .
but still , we do not know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said her organisation support the australian law because &quot; it gives adults the recognition as a third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , &quot; she said .
it is the german law on the allocation at birth .
this is not a fight , and we should force small children at this time .
when they grow up , they can decide on their bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz , a breast radio login from pitt castle , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group supports , says that the german law &quot; authorize &quot; both parents and children .
baratz &apos;s daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgenresistenz .
the goal because of faulty receptor cells for testosterone , katie developed female characteristics .
it has a vagina , but no uterus and ovaries .
today is katie 29 and married ; she works as an assistant in the child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
while she is infertile , hopes , however , to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , so they do not have to make hasty decisions , &quot; baratz said .
it gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; .
in this way , everything is fine - one draws the child in size and loves it .
it has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness .
and we must not rush to carry out an operation that cannot be undone .
&quot; that includes the children in the decision with a and removed the fear that parents concerned about , because they are of the opinion that they would not do the right thing , &quot; she explained .
ultimately decides the child on the sex that better suits him - and this is wonderful .
that children will be able to make the decision himself .

hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man , of not abandon and , ultimately , through his knowledge and his will win the fight against the fish .

he manages to focus the attention of the audience to itself , so that his monologues are boring at any moment .
his efforts to draw the fish to the surface of the water , are so real that the audience forget that the sea but consists only of blue illuminated water bottles .

fancy ice cream that glows in the dark ?
a british businessman has developed the first glow in the dark ice cream - with the help of jellyfish .
charlie francis , exploiting the fluorescent properties of marine animals and it created a luminous infinity .
the idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and chinese scientists have been able to convince the luminous protein artificially produce .
the ice cream responded in the consumption of the tongue , which will raise the ph value in the protein and triggered the lights .
chris said , the ice-cream responsive to the warmth in the mouth and light - the more you so licks , the brighter it .
charlie , the founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious , &quot; says : &quot; the product is unbelievable , but still in a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . &quot;
the protein used in ice cream responded with the tongue in a neutral ph .
if the mouth warms the protein , the ph value rises and shines the ice .
we have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to halloween on the market , because it has this wonderful contrast .
it is likely to be the most expensive ice cream , which i have ever made , because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious .
char read experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , which include beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but his latest creation should be even more ambitious .
he says : &quot; i would like to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
that is impossible in and of itself as a result of the atmosphere , which is caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream , but i suspect that we will find a way to create it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by chinese scientists

google , samsung , huawei sued for nortel patents
the group , which owns thousands of former nortel patents , strengte on thursday an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was outbid in the bankruptcy auction of nortel from him .
rockstar , the consortium that bought the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued samsung electronics co ltd and htc corp , huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in u.s. district court in texas .
rock star is located in community ownership of apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
in seven cases , google is accused of patent infringement .
the patents affect technology , the search terms on the internet in accordance with relevant advertising return , it hits the complaint that lies at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives of samsung , htc , huawei and rock star were not immediately available .
samsung , htc and huawei are mobile phones that work with google &apos;s android operating system , which is in sharp competition to the mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google an initial bid of $ 900 million for nortel patents .
google increased its offer several times and was last $ 4.4 billion .
after it was outbid for the nortel patents of rock star , google acquired motorola mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a deal that was also partly motivated by motor olas library of patents .
&quot; although google has failed in his attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents at the auction , google has violated the patents and continues to do so , &quot; says the complaint letter .
rock star calls for a high level of damages from google , as it claims that google &apos;s patent infringement is deliberately , so the accusation .

oil prices have further to up to $ 96 per barrel
the price of oil has fallen even further on friday , after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry china &apos;s manufacturing sector is growing .
the benchmark crude oil for delivery in december was the late morning in europe has fallen by 14 cents to 96,24 usd per barrel in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange .
the contract fell 39 cents on thursday , which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in october .
the large crude oil supply , the prices charged in the last few weeks .
the department of energy of the united states said on wednesday that the us offer have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer was increased by 25 million barrels .
but on friday , there was evidence of increased demand by two reports about an increase in activity in the chinese manufacturing .
this points to a continued recovery of the chinese economy , whose growth has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter , after it was reached in the previous quarter to the lowest level in two decades .
the strain brent crude , a benchmark for international crude oil , which is also used by u.s. refineries , fell by 26 cents to 108,58 usd per barrel on the ice exchange in london .
the disposable society does not think
the night was long , the music and the mood is good , but at some point it is home .
only : the hunger is noticeable in the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat .
clearly , this may be responsible for a cocktail or sparkling wine !
what is more logical than pretty chilled to drive to the next drive-in , in order to take a bite ?
i admit that i am happy with that , when it comes to fast food-fetching late at night or in the early morning .
some fries , a coke and a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed .
but on the way home are the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gängern felt .
for what must be a shortfall that it raises its fast-food bag from the car window with constant regularity ? !
especially at the weekends are discarded paper bags at the periphery and in parking lots .
&quot; why ? , &quot; i wonder .
the people are too stupid to take the bags with home or until the next dustbin ?
it is not the only way that the paper stuff disfigured the landscape .
bags have also been hidden transport facilities such as guard rails and caused by accidents .
think about something said &quot; disposable society &quot; but not after , presumably , they even know what the word actually means .
if you travel more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know , like a back seat after by celebrated nights can be : clothes , bottles and other garbage towers are there .
there were a few bags , more or less , but also represent nothing - in contrast to the street , where no one wants other rumtrampeln remains on the food .
i can already see the day is coming when the cities and communities to invest the removal - and the fast-food chain must demand a deposit for their bags .
milk and egg-alternatives at a glance
vegane diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
pürierter tofu cream with plants , for example , is a quark substitute .
further calls for the federal vegetarian weltvegantag on november 1 .
the vegetarian federal germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the world vegan day on november 1 .
pure flora margarine is a good alternative to butter substitute soy yogurt .
instead of milk , soy , hafer- , almond and rice milk can be used .
serve face plant cream replace conventional whipped cream .
there are herbal alternatives to eggs .
a half zerdrückte , ripe banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .
50 grams also be cooked into applesauce or a tablespoon of ground clay linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this .
loosely be doughs instead of egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , a tablespoon of catering strength and three esslöffeln mineral water .
but 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose .
according to the vebu feed is currently in germany around 800 000 people vegan , so purely vegetable .
a black box in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system , and believe to have found the solution in a small black box , which is in the dashboard of every car .
the devices that record every mileage and report the information to the authorities , are at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the planning office of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing american roads .
the normally rather boring area of the road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances .
libertarian have allied with environmental groups and are in favour of the government use the small boxes for the recording of the mileage - and possibly , where they were driven - and the information can then be used for the calculation of modest tax .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( ucla ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while people in congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years , at the driver a risk-mile pay .
thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring .
this really is a must for our country .
&quot; there is nothing that we may only be used , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the southern california assn. of governments , which plans a recording of the driven miles in all california motorists in the state in 2025 .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is funded by the taxes that americans pay at the pump , is broke .
but in america is no longer so much fuel tank as before .
cars use less gasoline .
the state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) is not increased for 20 years .
politicians dare not with high fuel prices to increase the tax by even a cent .
&quot; the gas tax is simply not sustainable , &quot; said lee munnich , an expert in traffic law at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently 500 cars with tachographs with which a mileage-based payment system is to be tested .
&quot; this is the most sensible alternative , &quot; he said .
bureaucrats describe it as a mileage-based user fee .
it is no surprise that the idea will appeal to urban liberals , because the tax could , for example , to try to influence the behaviour so that congestion and climate damaging emissions be reduced .
the californian planners rely on the system in the formulation of policies with which to achieve the ambitious goals set by the law of the state on climate change .
but the republicans see bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketer of the reason foundation are done from the idea to allow drivers to pay zurückgelegter route .
&quot; this is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice-president for directives on reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former american transport ministers , in a report in 2011 , had urged the congress to move in the direction of mileage-based billing .
the us senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project , which includes 10,000 cars last year .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the thrust and responded to the concerns of mps from rural areas who represent people in everyday life often have to travel many miles on the way to work or in the city .
several states and cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own .
most committed is oregon , which currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment of the country .
these drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
illinois tests it in a limited way with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , are currently investigating how one could introduce the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices , motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move .
&quot; concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , head of the strategy and product management in the transport ministry of nevada .
the people did not want it .
as the trial started , the aclu of nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices . &quot;
there is no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably would be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can collect the mileage , but not exactly when and where .
with that , khan , would also be free to the public .
the pursuit of this technology has led some authorities on a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company is not originally taken in order to help states in the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their goal to gain a foothold in the emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles .
but the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information , which are regularly uploaded via modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , &quot; said ryan morrison , managing director of true mileage .
big mistake has been made in some of these public pilot programmes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it .
in oregon , the planners of this experiment to give drivers a number of choices .
you can opt for a device with or without gps .
or they choose no equipment and pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles instead .
other authorities hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public , as they provide the equipment with more features than with little more .
in new york city traffic officials want to develop a device on taxation , which is also pay parking fees , insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data can be collected from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers avoid traffic jams .
&quot; motorists were motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to take part , &quot; says a planning document of the city .
however , some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about the pay per mile was not just a huge red herring .
at the metropolitan transportation commission on the territory of the san francisco bay , officials said that congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust fund by simply increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid cars or other vehicles that consume less gasoline , so they also pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no reason for an operation , even if an aspirin is enough , &quot; said randy rentschler , the head of the commission &apos;s legislative and public affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists care about their privacy , and many other things .
bad dürrheim : a dream comes true for the fc
in the importance for the city and the football club , the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sport despite the cold weather and the rain took nothing .
a more pleasant ceremony last saturday had probably all wanted , but peter did not play it .
it had all those at a disadvantage , which came with no umbrella or such a could not hold for any reason .
this was the musicians who framed the ceremony , as well as so many speakers .
wet , therefore , the combination of fc chairman albrecht spoke of the fulfilment of a dream .
his gratitude was led by mayor walter klumpp , which is strongly committed to the implementation of the project , the local council , the companies involved , and members of an association that is presented .
here , in particular , lothar hero , paul wheat egger , heiner gail and peter graf .
the sprightly pensioner relocated 400 square tiles for the new ways .
this remarkable voluntary commitment also praised the provincial representative karl rombach .
further greeting words spoke for urban sport committee hubert baier , the district chairman of south badischen football association , kuno kayan , and friedrich knorr from the planning office , announced a donation for the youth section of the club .
mayor klumpp brought in memory that recurring weather-related influences the original grass pitch afflicted so that he could not be played in spring and autumn .
15 years ago , there was the first ideas to solve the problem , as was thought to the construction of a third place in the area of the football club or in the secondary school on the salinensee .
both was rejected again .
six years ago , thoughts on the creation of an artificial turf sport square came on what was widely regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were included two years ago , when the fc took over the chronicle schabelstube , pledged a cost of eur 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of eur 104 000 .
the council decided in october 2012 the acquisition of the remaining eur 356 million of the total cost of eur 560 000 , summarised klumpp together .
the start of the 68 times 108 metre artificial turf pitch was made on june 4 .
during the construction phase lasted about three months , 3,000 cubic metres of earth were discharged , half of which was used for the creation of a dirt-bike route .

edward snowden , the whistleblower of the american secret service , has said he is prepared to travel to berlin and in the german bundestag to say if the us national security agency and its director keith alexander be no answers on their activities .
the german mep hans-christian stroebele met snowden in russia , where it has received asylum on thursday to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which was presented on friday by the media in berlin stroebele , writes this : &quot; even if the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive , treated my government continue to break a dissenting opinion as loyalty and tried to criminalize political expression with criminal threat in defence is not possible . &quot;
to tell the truth , however , is not a crime .
snowden writes in the letter , he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the american government to drop the charges against him .
the collected by the us department of justice indictment includes espionage and theft of state property .
the german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said over time online : &quot; if mr snowden is prepared to talk with german representatives , we will find ways to allow that . &quot;
relations between the united states and germany are burdened by the allegations that the nsa had bugged the phone of chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the mep , who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness , if that is possible , &quot; without prejudice to him and completely ruining relations with the us . &quot;
stroebele , a member of the greens , posted a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was accompanied by two german journalists during his visit to russia .
stroebele said that , according to the lawyer of former nsa employee snowden could not return to russia , if he leave the country .
if snowden said in germany , then he needs an assurance that he was &quot; sure &quot; that the member .
snowden said in his letter that he would face a &quot; serious and ongoing &quot; persecution campaign that have driven him from his home country .
however , he is touched by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
people around the world , as well as senior politicians , including in the united states , have described the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive monitoring system as a credit to the general public .
in his letter , snowden makes an offer of cooperation , &quot; if the problems have been resolved around the humanitarian situation &quot; of the german authorities .
security concerns in mozambique grow in light of clashes between influential personalities
thousands of people gathered in the centre maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president of mozambique , samora machel , call for peace in a rare public demonstration crowing .
&quot; we want peace , we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
out of fear for the future of the country , it has exchanged their business clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription &quot; we want security &quot; in portuguese and joined the crowd at the independence square in the capital on thursday .
for two weeks , there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement for over 20 years .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , which was initially supported by the apartheid government of south africa from white-ruled rhodesia and later in a bid to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it has become an opposition party .
analysts believe it is unlikely that the country back into a full-blown conflict trap , but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals .
much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could investment of more than $ 50 billion over the next few years by companies such as rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko bring into the country from the united states .
the ruling frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and renamo are blaming each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government had provoked the latest clashes , with its members in sofala province , a traditional stronghold on 17 october renamos , had attacked .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated , when government troops attacked renamo bases and tried to kill afonso dhlakama , the leader of the group , said renamos spokesman told the financial times .
the government is renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .
with afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhlakama regard themselves as &quot; losers &quot; who &quot; wants to use all his remaining forces in order to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . &quot;
both frelimo and renamo stress that they want to avoid a war .
but the concerns have grown since mazanga was cited with the words , renamo acknowledge the 1992 peace agreement .
with the ft , he said that he had meant that frelimo no longer respect the agreement .
&quot; our vision is to restart negotiations and seriously , &quot; mazanga said .
previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolve the tensions that have been fired by a series of clashes this year .
&quot; we have two adult men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) that the heads collide here , &quot; says joseph &apos;hanlon , a lecturer at the open university and mozambique-expert .
none of them is good in the negotiation and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , which pushes on electoral reform , has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in november .
presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government .
renamos electoral success shrink since 1992 , during a recent party founded by a former renamo member movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , probably will improve in the elections .
mazanga claimed that guebuza , whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year , wanted to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he wants no multi-party democracy , it wants no transparent elections that he does not want peace , because he does not want to abandon the presidency , &quot; said mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo has , but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections .
most fighting took place in the sofala province , which lies a few hundred miles north of maputo , beira but finds itself in , the port , the use of coal mining companies like rio tinto and vale for export .
in june , rio for a month is the use of the railways , after renamo had announced an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo will repeat that threat .
renamo &quot; wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in mozambique , &quot; mazanga said .
the instability have increased the frustration over the government yet , says fernando lima , head of media coop , an independent media company , because a lot of people were concerned earlier because of corruption , the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave .
&quot; people think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems , &quot; he says .
omar sultans , a protestor , said that the people simply wanted stability .
&quot; no interest renamo and frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , &quot; he said .

nsa declared that an &quot; internal error &quot; and not hackers were to blame on the website crash
the shadow of a national security agency said late friday that a mistake had crippled its public website for a few hours and not hackers , as has been claimed online .
&quot; nsa.gov was last night unavailable for a few hours , as is an internal error during a planned updates , &quot; explained the spy agency in a message sent via e-mail .
the problem will be fixed on this evening .
the claim that the crash had been caused by a executed distributed denial of service attack ( ddos ) is not true .
in the early evening hours was online server sites noted that the nsa website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not for some users .
a spokesman for the nsa to abc news had previously stated that the sensitive internal network of the authority was &quot; in no way &quot; compromised .
secret information were not in danger , said the spokesman .
at least one study group took advantage for themselves , to have crippled the nsa website with a ddos attack .
in such attacks will call the target site with pages flooded , until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .
the cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not to invade the internal network of the target system .
the once super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once the search agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and faces sharp criticism after the revelations about her extensive surveillance program revealed in the last few months at home and abroad - a result of the secret nsa data stolen from the disaffected former nsa employee edward snowden and published .
the growing controversy about the secret service by initial speculation about the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .
snowden could also testify in russia
the former us intelligence analyst edward snowden could make statements in his russian asylum in the us spähaffäre .
representatives of the federal attorney-general could either ask questions in writing or make the 30-year-olds personally in russia .
the reported the agency interfax invoking not closer named circles who are familiar with the situation .
such a question can be resolved between the state , they said .
snowden &apos;s exit from russia is virtually impossible .
&quot; in this case , he loses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quoted its source .
because germany is an ally of the united states , threatening the extradition , snowden there was further
children should be taught as &quot; role models for life &quot; of myths and legends , an author says .
the stories of thor showed that &quot; brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , &quot; and the arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
many of the myths are , however , &quot; far too wild , too offensive and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught in schools , &quot; why crossley-holland pleaded for a &quot; careful selection &quot; age just works .
&quot; i think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in america are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i have already proposed a plan for 20 years .
he added that in the case of authors and teachers were &quot; overly didactic &quot; , children would &quot; shut it down completely , &quot; because in entertaining stories would conveys the message &quot; undercurrent &quot; .
crossley-holland , the beowulf has translated from the anglo-saxon and author of the penguin book of hebrew myths and the british folk tales , explained : &quot; you can be certain intentions , but you should keep it in the background as possible . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults , and an author who writes for children , is the need to convey hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy endings , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .
this must be presented subliminally , explained by the story and not be revealed .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .

there is only a single parish council for all six parishes .
in a joint meeting prepared on saturday after the bodies of bikes , years , mills bach , fischer bach , alpine and catfish chen tei on the changes before .
because of the fundamental decisions is the diocese to change anything and it is up to the parish councils to implement this as satisfactory .
in the course of the day was particularly evident : the scepticism towards the new is tentatively but increasingly a confidence .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council filed the very constructive talks with the main official of the ministry team of six bodies .
regional dean george schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation of the recast directives for ministry units in the archdiocese of freiburg .

tax for foreign property owners against london &apos;s speculative bubble
the treasury has provisionally through the cgt-measure calculated , is still waiting for the final decision by chancellor of the exchequer george osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp duty on homes in the 2012 budget that cost more than two million pounds , as well as annual fees for buyers , keep the apartments as a company and not as individuals .
already exceed the revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , which stood at £ 708 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , the proceeds for northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north east , north west , yorkshire and the humber region put together .
cook said : &quot; after the stamp tax increases on high-priced owned apartments and the introduction of related legislation against the circumventing one can hardly claim that high quality properties are too low tax , regardless of the impact of the old county tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this step could discourage some foreign investors cautious with regard to the purchase of real estate in london , or owners to sell , &quot; he added .
first-class property - the top five to ten percent of the housing market after prices - in the wealthy london southwest belt , which stretches from fulham to wimbledon , have become more expensive for the record 11.8 % in the last year .
prices in central london had a steady annual growth of 5.6 % on , but were overshadowed by an emerging &quot; domestic market , on the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , as an investigation of savills .
even if the sg achim / baden is for four games without victory , there is still a good atmosphere in the handball-oberliga ) .
this leaves coach tomasz malmon no doubt at all .
all are still fully motivated for the cause .
however , i hope that we will finally win again , too .
&quot; because i know already no longer , as a victory tastes , &quot; expected malmon a successful experience of his team at vfl fredenbeck ii
although the third league-reserve from fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted , highlights malmon in advance warning of the index finger .
many players i have trained myself in the a-youth .
so they will certainly be particularly motivated against her ex-coach .
&quot; it is to be seen whether it is still gain from the first , &quot; highlights the sg-coach .
for a long time to return to the track gauge , must increase the malmon team compared to previous appearances in any case .
above all , in the work of the coverage and the shift game it suffered last is huge .
also the chances recovery must definitely be better .
therefore , i hope that my players have received free during the short break at the head .
america will continue to prosecute snowden
the united states has not changed its stance on the former us intelligence employee edward snowden .
he will continue to have accused of illegally passed on secret information .

the recent comments of snowden would not change this .
previously the german green politician hans-christian ströbele after a meeting with snowden in moscow , appealed to the united states not to threaten him with further punishment .
psaki emphasized that ströbeles statements is that of a parliamentarian was and is not a member of a german government .
report : obama campaign considered to replace biden with hillary clinton
president barack obama &apos;s closest advisers have secretly considered to replace vice president joe biden in the 2012 election campaign with hillary clinton , the new york times .
the revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by mark get and john healthy man on the 2012 election campaign , &quot; double down : game change 2012 . &quot;
the times is a copy of the forthcoming book and they reported on thursday evening that the presidential topberater had carried out &quot; extensive group meetings and surveys by the end of 2011 &quot; to find out whether it look better for obama &apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election , when he will be biden .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent of the times , is the book thoroughly in the history of the efforts from senior officials of the campaign and the white house , notably of former white house chief of staff bill daley , to measure what effect they have on the poll numbers , the former secretary of state clinton to trade against the vice president .
the potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and in the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisors , including daley , obama &apos;s former campaign manager , jim messina , and the former white house senior adviser , david axelrod and david plouffe , knew about the planned changes .
in &quot; double down &quot; claim , daley have been at the forefront of efforts , biden despite their &quot; close personal relationship &quot; exchange , before it is finally decided against such a move , after the data showed that clinton &apos;s candidacy &quot; would &quot; not significantly improve obama &apos;s chances .
in an interview with martin confirmed daley that the government had actually considered to replace biden with clinton .
&quot; i made a whole series of things that should consider it , and this was one of them , &quot; said daley the magazine .
it must be remembered that the president at that time had terrible poll numbers , so we thought : &quot; for god &apos;s sake , what do we do ? &quot;
while daley described the investigation as &quot; due diligence &quot; , said martin to anderson cooper of cnn that had been operated during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move is in relation to the ballot box auszahle .
&quot; in campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups , if you don &apos;t think seriously about something , &quot; said martin on ac360 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .
martin said on cnn , he said daley asked whether his former boss on the potential change would have known about it .
although daley has said that he does not believe that the president was aware of the possible change &quot; , &quot; , the former chief admitted that it was &quot; possible &quot; that obama was aware of them .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; would not deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings reached obama &apos;s desk .
cooper asked martin whether he had seriously think obama knew nothing of the investigation on whether one should drop biden in the elections .
&quot; possible , &quot; martin replied .
local council appreciates sound budget
whenever it comes in council meetings around the budget , mayor ralph gerster has a good laugh .
the herd gemeindesäckl cheeks-schönach is well stocked and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005 .
in this sense , the 2012 financial year can also be booked as an unqualified success .
this was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andrea roth mouth explained , is the administrative budget with approximately 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget also lies with about eur 1.8 million around a million euros on the approach .
the result was the surplus mainly higher corporate tax revenue and the local share of the income tax .
the capital budget was again well above the planned values .
instead of the proposed eur 1.5 million he averaged 2.5 million euros last year .
&quot; this is essentially on the higher feed from the administrative budget , &quot; says roth mouth .
there have been fewer investments have been made as planned , is also the reserve feeding higher in 2012 .
overall , the general reserve could be increased by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million now .
mayor ralph gerster thanked roth mouth and her team for the good work .
&quot; as a work shakes you not just from the sleeve , &quot; praised renaissance with a view of the annual financial statements .
he and the municipal councils were visibly on the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures , the public could soon pay dearly .
through the good financial situation the county in the past could forgo high lifting rates .

an obama voter cry of despair
i have twice elected president obama in the hope that change is possible
he says that obama has commendable efforts had been thwarted by the republican blocking tactics
the blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of obamacare , the drone attacks
obama &apos;s memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at harvard medical school .
i read a terribly sad book at the moment .
it is a book , of which i have believed that it would spot me during the sad second year of my medical degree and give me hope again .
it is called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs of barack obama in the 2008 presidential election .
if i am ready for dinner with my patient transcripts and go to bed , it brings me back to the book at a time when the policy inspired millions and the speeches were able to take your breath away .
the election was held to a landslide victory and news spokesman to lead the historical significance of this hour before your eyes .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers , they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
as obama into office in 2008 at that time , he had approval values of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a rude awakening , as if one is ripped from a dream .
it is difficult to recall these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i have given my voice for the first time , something has changed .
but there is simply nothing that i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things that obama has achieved , from the passage of the affordable care act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from iraq , the end of forced ) of homosexuality in the army and the killing of osama bin laden .
i also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have dumped on many efforts , with which our nation should be brought forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of guantanamo bay , just to name a few .
but after countless times defended the obama administration against colleagues and friends , i am with my statement attempt at the end .
i have reached a point of political desperation .
the republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows for the interception of foreign leaders or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency collects data about the private lives of americans and why whistleblower punished , to disclose government misconduct .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , was killed without trial , nor why the public financing and spending limits be circumvented during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report , which states that the efforts of the white house to restrain the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and jüngstens cannot excuse the inability to create a simple web site in more than three years since the passage of the affordable care act .
i don &apos;t know if that is what i would have expected .
whether i with 18 should have understood that the government could run counter to its previous political campaigns .
apparently the abgeordnetenamt is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the newtown massacre shape the public debate .
but when i look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bothers me the most .
i have re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative , he seemed unable to determine its direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would comply with the hope that we had heard for so long .
but with the sinking of the approval ratings for obama to below 45 % this week has become the return in 2008 by this book so much harder .
it awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air .
this week i read a section in the book , which describes how obama had to plug a heavy loss against clinton in the primaries in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision , he told his staff that they must come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
&quot; i would like us to find the magic , &quot; he said .
we must remind us who we are .
five years later , mr. president , and i could not agree more .
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of nathaniel morris .

the cost of electricity in pfullendorf
the citizens pfullendorfs must adjust to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the municipal works , jörg-arne bias , opposite suedkurier confirmed , come on a four-member pfullendorfer family to 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called eeg 5,277 levy on 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy will be re-established in october from the four operators of the great power lines each year .
this put the extra costs incurred of turning them out of the energy that can make it through a levy on the price of electricity .
the stadtwerke pfullendorf form the last link in the chain .
in its forecasts , the supervisory board of the energy company was even reported a higher levy assumed , like jörg-arne bias .
now the concrete figures should be calculated before next week , the stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase .
&quot; we go from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; bias , and the number will be in the vicinity of 2 cents more .
josef winkler writes the woes of his childhood and youth of the soul for more than 30 years .
the disasters of his catholic village childhood - the silence , the slope of raw violence and blunt sexuality , a corner and freudlosigkeit - has described the carinthian poet in many cases .
the lee-award winner is known primarily as a prose writer , theatre texts are rare in his work .
collage of prose texts gerhard fresacher marks for his performance &quot; weather lights on the tip of the tongue , &quot; which is now in the garage to see x on peter square , therefore a collage of prose texts together .
the theatre-maker combines elements from the auto road embossed novel &quot; the serf &quot; ( 1987 ) with prose miniatures from &apos; corpse , his family belauernd &quot; ( 2003 ) .
largely emptied on the stage - important requisit : a zerknautschtes sofa , on the suggestion way kopuliert and masturbates - hangelt will the eight-member ensemble through the text material .
at the same time , director fresacher seems not to trust the text .
the 70-minute performance hid the presentation with a plethora of directing incursions , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms .
above all , the actresses come in the sometimes rather dubious scenic transpositions off .
they are hard touched , plunged with his head under water , with their evening gowns on the wall getackert .
sandwiched in cellophane or corsetry , create them to dangerously high stöckeln through the staging , either monologisieren they loudly or are completely silent on the stage floor .
the text conveys the hard way but hardly .
the best moments of the evening when sung - the spectrum ranges from deep purple to popular songs .
until the end , something about the performance to rest , and winkler &apos;s after just absurd humor bang on .
