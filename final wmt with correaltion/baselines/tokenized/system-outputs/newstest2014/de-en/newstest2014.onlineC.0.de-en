they can vote for it or one of the other heros in the top 10 in order to select it to the &quot; cnn hero of the year &quot; .
the victor receives 250,000 dollars to the continuation of its extraordinary work .
for 21 years saw be lost georges bwelle with on , how sick father again and again the consciousness and traveled to hospitals , that did not control the means in order to help it .
jamef bwelle became 1981 in a car accident in the vicinity of yaoundé , that injures capital of cameroon .
first it had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation , that expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma , that should impair it for the remainder of its life , formed .
&quot; it gave no neurochirurgen in cameroon &quot; , so georges bwelle .
we would have brought out it from cameroon if we had had the money .
instead spent bwelle years therewith , its father in overfilled to accompany clinics and hospitals , in order to get there the treatment , that they had to offer .
&quot; it is not simple &quot; , comments on bwelle .
one can leave at five o &apos;clock mornings the house and race is to the hospital in order to be the first , and yet not first .
there are very many patients .
some people die even because they must wait .
the situation did hardly change since bwelles father 2002 died .
in cameroon , there is only a physician for 5,000 people apiece , so the world health organization .
on the other hand the ratio in the united states is about a physician for 413 people .
yet even if there would be a physician for it , most kameruner could not afford the visit .
two of five people in the country live beneath the poverty line and almost three quarters the medical expenses in the country are private .
&quot; the single problem , that it have , is poverty &quot; , says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossibly to enjoy life .
to see suffer its father and so many of its compatriots let ripen in bwelle the decision to undertake somewhat on the other hand .
dr. georges bwelle and be carried out volunteer team in the last year 700 free operations .
it became even physician and works as a container surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
moreover it established a public-spirited organization by the name of ascovime that travels at weekends into rural areas and offers there free medical provision .
since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped nearly 32,000 people .
he would force himself nearly every friday and up to 30 people in small penance and go tied up with that medical equipment on the roof over unfortified grounds into the villages , that require aid .
always all does not pass smooth .
they had to push already more than once the vehicles through rivers and mud .
yet if they arrive , they will receive like heros : a banquet , song and dance and the best lodging that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical provision is is actual a reason for the celebrations and bwelle – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – gladly in the cheerful celebration there .
at the next morning , the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients .
&quot; per trip treat we 500 people &quot; , so bwelle .
they come out of a vicinity of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot .
each of this wochenendkliniken offers medical provision in a row of areas .
many people are treated because of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasite and sexually transferable illnesses .
others receive crutch , contributed glasses or free birth documents – a document that is required for the school , however many poor families simply do not afford can .
evenings the team carries out operations simple with local anesthetic .
the operations take place normally in a school , the city hall or a dwelling ; after the intervention , the patients rise and go into the recovery area to make around place for the neighbors .
the illumination for the op and the disinfection equipment is fed of the generator of the group and so bwelle and its volunteers work into the early morning hours on sunday .
it is a strenuous stint , but the village musicians help normally to hold the team motivated .
&quot; you drum the entire night , so that we awake remain and our work continue can &quot; , says bwelle .
on sunday the team will go then back into the city , tiredly , but proud of the performed work .
the group – a mixture out of kamerunischen physicians and foreign medicine student – carried out free operations in the last year 700 and knows that she causes an enormous difference with its work for the people , whom she helps .
a man explained that the free operation of a strip breach that he had received would enable it now to work again .
&quot; that changes the future of my family &quot; , meant the man .
next to the wochenendkliniken and its work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle works also at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job , it finances 60 % of its public-spirited activity , so bwelle ; the remainder comes from private contributions .
&quot; i knows really not , when it sleeps &quot; , says katie o &apos; malley that studies in the second year at the drexel university in philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in bwelles group .
it is always either in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that it can go on this campaign .
for medicine students and nursing students such as o &apos; malley , that come out of the usa and europe and support bwelle , is this a chance to gather practical experiences , that never would get it at home .
&quot; we can in operations at the same time be , where we help , blood to dab away or the instruments for dr. bwelle hold &quot; , explains o &apos; malley .
that never would be in america possible as a medicine student in the second year .
the students pay its trip to cameroon normally even and bring frequently contributed sanitätsmaterial with .
if they are however first once in yaoundé , bwelle receives the lodging , the carrier and the instructions .
&quot; it is entire without doubt a hero &quot; , says o &apos; malley .
it dedicates its life of this organization and its wish to help the kamerunischen people , knows no boundaries .
for bwelle , the nearly permanent work is no load .
to help other to a happier life and to fulfill therewith a promise , that it gave its father , large joy prepares it .
&quot; i am so happy , if i this work would make &quot; , means bwelle .
and i think of my father .
i hope , it sees , what i do .
i make it in order to bring people again for laughing and in order to mitigate the pains .

pope franziskus appoints in february first cardinals
pope franziskus would call new cardinals of the catholic church on the 22nd of february for the first time how the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are are the around highest clerics in the catholic church after the pope and it it also , the one popes select so that franziskus therewith the first group will appoint of men , who will co-operate in the end in the choice of its successor .
presently there are 201 cardinals .
however a cardinal , who reached an age of 80 years , can participate , no longer in the pope choice – that falls a group of 120 &quot; cardinals &quot; entitled to vote to .
in an explanation , in which the message was announced , father federico lombardi , a speaker of the vatican said would take place , it a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony would be held off to the appointment of the new cardinals , that would be well known also as a konsistorium .
&quot; pope franziskus concluded , its decision to the summoning of the konsistoriums in february in advance well known to give , so that other meeting , that the participation of cardinals out of all world require , planned will can &quot; , said lombardi .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote probably would have sunk until february .
he explained , a pope appoints normally so many cardinals such as compel so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote again 120 would amount to , and so many cardinals would like over 80 , how he .
let the konsistorium in the next year be therefore significant because it would be the first since the choice of franziskus in march these years , so valero .
presently there are one certain overhang on the part of europe and especially italy .
&quot; it becomes interesting be to see , whether the new pope of cardinals out of the remainder of the world appoint becomes , around the balance to restore &quot; , said he .
forty percent of the catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will be also the first , that are called since the development of the advice established by franziskus of the cardinals , a group of eight cardinals out of the entire world , that have the order to find possibilities to the reformation of the church .
in the past , the pope of all decided alone .
&quot; now has franziskus these eight cardinals selected , that it help should &quot; , said valero .
it explained , let it be &quot; well possible &quot; that franziskus the cardinals around advice please .
yet previously we were not in this situation – that is all entirely new .
valero said that characteristically the bishops would be called out of large places to cardinals , but franziskus of &quot; full surprises would stick – we do not know therefore , whom he appoints &quot; .

are elite europe ready to make with great britain of businesses ?
business for britain was started in april with the intention to bring and to define the economy at a table , what that would like to change , that provide in great britain for prosperity and work , at our relations to the eu .
to this purpose , we gave the largest and most comprehensive survey under british business leaders in order and asked it , what it over great britain , that think economy and the eu .
yougov questioned over 1,000 managements out of the economy , that portray into about the british business sizes , -sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we found out that the predominant majority of the businesses exports outside of europe in the meantime and concentrates on countries , that modernize and grow , while the countries stagnate in the eu .
they wish for that by government side new trade connections with countries such as china , india and brazil are favored instead of staying with the long and strenuous process , to reform the obscure eu institutions .
ask about its view to certain legally regulated subjects – of the cartel right to the product legislation – is the majority the business leaders the view that become should gotten back control of these key competences after westminster .
general discontent ruled over the domestic market because according to statements of the businesses the costs of that would predominate brussels directions in the meantime the advantages to be part of europe trade zone – even 40 percent of the large firms agreed that to , that are traditional at the europe friendliest .
in the end , and that says probably most , yielded our inquiry of business leaders that a clear majority wishes for of great britain a course toward variation of the agreement and a relation to the eu that is based on trade , not on politics .
this insight , that is found in business of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy presses on a &quot; meaningful variation &quot; , that brings the notebook of the actions again to great britain .
it concerns much – a change of the agreement and better conditions for great britain would lead in 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubts : this survey shows that the british economy stands behind its plan for the renegotiations of the british conditions for the eu membership .
it shows also that the businesses of a renegotiation expect a clear postponement of the power ratios back to great britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and in increasing mass necessary after the eurozone moves now toward a narrower economy and fiskalunion .
jobs and growth in great britain must be the priority how the result of our survey shows , what means for business a reinforced attention on trade and a fundamental variation in that brussels extension for directions .

gutachs mayor clearly answered this question yesterday .
&quot; the city hall traffic light is certain at that time installs become , because this the school way &quot; , clarified eckert yesterday .
the kluser traffic light secures both cyclist and bus passengers and the bergle inhabitants .

if the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the street is free , green comes directly for the pedestrian if not , lasts it about 15 seconds .
a radar sensor further tests whether the green phase can be concluded for the pedestrian .
&quot; should a group or gehbehinderte people over the street go , becomes the green phase extends , it comes therefore every certainly over the roadway &quot; , explained arnold .
naturally the driver had to follow here as a partner and had to observe the roadway .
this was not yesterday the case : hardly the traffic light showed for pedestrian green , rustled an upper class vehicle through - in illuminating red .

halloween 2013 : in numbers
when i was small , halloween had something magic .
my sister and i were allowed to eat candy , late might stay up and disguise us for the neighborhood .
today i became sooner the halloween muffel .
in the last two years , i did not explain myself ready to distribute of my dwelling out of candy , and it would not do probably also this year .
but according to statistics , i am a black sheep what concerns halloween .
the majority of the americans – 158 million , around exactly to its – celebrate this year halloween and give at the same time altogether 6.9 billions of u.s. dollar for candy , costumes and decoration from , so the us american association of the retailers ( nrf ) .
the trend values are a thing on which i please me each halloween then yet again .
the costumes will settle about 1.2 billions of the 6.9 billions of issued u.s. dollar , so the nrf .
this year inciting inanimate objects are the last scream .
women must wrap themselves no longer in sexy clothing , they can embody now also seductive meal such as about pizza , hamburger or carrot .
i expect what men concerns , a lot of zombies thanks to the whale king dead , and i bet , the daft-punk-space men will create it this year into the that day ram feeds .
according to google , the usually sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirate and witch .
i assume , it is associated nothing at tradition .
we disguised last year our dogs and were therewith not alone to my astonishment .
actually americans issue 330 million dollars this year for costumes of its pets , so the nrf .
those are a quantity &quot; hot dogs &quot; .
we are not what concerns candy , prim .
americans will issue this year 1.9 billions of dollar for that , so the nielsen company .
those are about 270 million kilograms at chocolate bars , lollipops , sweet and gummi bear .
therefore good messages for that according to us trade ministry 41 million people that pass &quot; sweet or sour &quot; with the saying through the quarters .
actually we will buy and – make we us nothing before – eat chocolate over 40 million kilograms for halloween .
the only what we would not like to consume , the sugar sweet candy corn is ; nevertheless become 15 million kilograms therefrom around halloween sold , so the national association of the candy manufacturers .
those are about nine billions of grains of corn .
it is a riddle that i was not able to solve yet .
does nothing belong more to halloween than houses , in which it spukt .
they have magnificent names such as &quot; terror behind of the rampart &quot; ( what by the way in a real prison stands ) , „ howl-o-scream &quot; and &quot; the house of shock &quot; .
there are officially acknowledged closes actually 1,200 spukhäuser in the united states that obtain 500 million dollars proceeds , so america haunts , and that the wonderful photos on , on which one pees himself just into the pair of pants and the friends place then on facebook , where one does not get rid of it again , and one then the type on which one stands , a commentary leaves behind like &quot; nice expression &quot; .
but let &apos;s come finally to the pumpkins .
charlie brown made with the large pumpkin trusted to us when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is like the decorating of the christmas tree – something , that we of small on made have .
fortunately began the &quot; babies in the pumpkin &quot; -trend year first last thanks to pinterest so that that of us grew up therewith , the pumpkin carve right and to not to sit , therein .
this year americans will issue about 106 million dollars for pumpkins , so that us census bureau .
the pumpkin lantern , that decays slowly in the before garden , comes probably from illinois where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins .
if you would want correctly points , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and carve you something pretty out of its 921 kilogram pumpkin .

yet it contested to have undertaken the changes on favors of obeid , that how tripodi confirmed , on a change of the lease regulations of the government pressed had .
telephone written record produced one the icac showed conversations out of the august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a leading official , that was changed into the harbor ministry , after he had worked under obeid in the fishery authority .
was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations &quot; the elaboration of the commercial leasing regulations &quot; ? , asked the deputy commission member anthony whealy tripodi .
&quot; no &quot; , tripodi answered .
i cannot remember , what was discussed , but that was not it definitively .

nsa uncovering reinforce firm paranoia because of national supervision
at a mild day the end of august a german police helicopter flew deeply over the us consulate in frankfurt / main , the finance capital of germany .
on direction of the federal bureau for constitution protection and terrorism fight ( bvt ) , the german interior secret service , , it should photograph the roof of the us außenpostens , that less than 5 km of the european central bank and the german federal bank is .
according to german media , the bvt wanted to prove the existence of supervision antennas and led the action to a word change between the usa and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us american director of nationally intelligence , existed in september again on that that the usa used no possibilities of the foreign espionage , &quot; around the business secrets of foreign businesses on behalf of us american firms to steal , so that this its international competitiveness or its profit expand could &quot; .
yet since edward snowden , the colleague become former to the whistleblower , with whom publication of its cornucopia began at us american supervision secrets , european governments and business bosses are certain no longer whether they can take the director in the word .
report according to what the american nationally security agency the brazilian oil firm petrobas spied out and procured itself data of american cloud suppliers including google and yahoo , brought the firm paranoia because of national supervision on a new record level .
the cask for overflowing has brought the uncovering that chancellor was angela merkels telephone verwanzt , possibly already for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can run into the visor , also managements are with security potential goals .
snowden transparently made the intensive collaboration between us secret services and business .
i believe , it is conceivable that these data are used for mutual utility .
&quot; germany must wake up &quot; , explains oliver green , president of the bitmi who represents small and middle it firms in germany .
believe german businesses , the usa placed a nearly just as large risk there now like china if it would concern industry espionage and data theft , so a survey that was published in july by the adviser firm ey .
in the documents oozed by snowden , there was to be sure previously no record that the usa transmitted the business secrets of foreign businesses at own firms .
politicians expressed its worry about that that the eu certain it should and internet were missing possibilities and it should reduce its dependence of the usa .
the businesses are relating to this sceptical .
in the bundestag was proposed , should construct we a german google .
i can close only my eyes and open it slowly again ...
&quot; so functions that not &quot; , says hasso plattner , chairperson of the german software manufacturer sap .
if one had wanted a strong european it industry , one would not have become extinct let should it 20 years ago .
all in germany is subsidized , by the coal over cars to the agriculture .
all , up to the it sector .
nevertheless range and technical subtlety of the us espionage authorities uncovered by the snowden uncovering shocked firms , that had seen previously the largest espionage risk in china .
in the cloud computing , a large variation takes place because european business leaders are more aware themselves now , that in the usa stored data of the jurisdiction there are subject and potentially are endangerd therefore .
loudly an of the cloud security alliance , a trade institution , carried out survey about ten of percent the members resident in the usa of plans do not reject after the uncovering over the us american dates-mining-activities with prism to use an american supplier .
jim snabe , deputy manager of sap , says : &quot; we there see were a new question of customers , that a year ago not yet – it reads : where are my data stored and can guarantee you , remain that these physical in this area of law &quot; ?
many german business leaders represent the view , the youngest reports confirm simply only , what they already knew anyway , namely that powerful countries want to steal its most valuable secrets and these must be guarded therefore around every price .
that economy espionage takes place , is no surprise .
that was already always so .
&quot; it was many years long a subject and has itself through the current discussion not fundamental changed &quot; , says kurt ram , chairperson of the chemistry business basf .
the americans spy out us on more commercially and more industrially plain so how we make that also , for it is in the national interest , to defend our businesses .
the business management does not boast normally over the countermeasure , that one seized , for that provides aggressors advantages .
in large businesses , already long petition loud becomes colleagues that the bringing of a free usb stick on a fair or that not advisably would be unguarded situation calm a laptop in the hotel room , mildly said .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of directors with car manufacturer audi , says that it has belonged for years to the standard practice to gather the mobile phones before a vorstandstreffen so that they cannot be used as bugging devices .
the german bvt advises managements to use simple prepaid mobile phones if they go on trips abroad , because smartphones possibly can be compromised .
the prepaid mobile phones are thrown away afterwards .
the worry exists to be sure that small and middle businesses remain attack cash vis-à-vis hacking and supervision .
in germany , many market leaders worldwide these businesses in the respective niche are .
&quot; small and middle business be missing often the experience , the personnel and the financial resources , around business secrets effectively against not authorized access to protect &quot; , warns the bvt in a report .
own firms warn the usa against economy espionage through other countries .
according to washington post were incorporated in the us national intelligence estimate france , russia and israel behind china in february on rank two of the countries , that made use of to the procurement of economy data of the hackings .
a member of the board of directors of a german blue-chip-business agreed if it would concern economy espionage , &quot; are the frenchmen the worst &quot; .
bernard squarcini , former leader of the french interior secret service dcrl , became this month in an interview with following words quoted : &quot; the secret services know very exactly , that all countries , even if it in the battle against the terror collaborate , its allies spy out &quot; .
when the horse shows experts in multitudes in cardiff appeared themselves , around the horse of the year to cures , was was aware , that a hard competition forthcoming for for them .
yet none was prepared for the three years of old fenton kirkland .
the whippersnapper , that is not yet once in the kindergarten and made first a few months ago its first steps , and its shetland pony toffee trotted round and got loosely through the three the first price – where it 30 adult opponents behind itself let .
the inseparable couple , both equally largely , were praised because of its appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition , that is arranged by the sunnybank equestrian centre in rudry near cardiff .
in its entrance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had mounted its plate cap in an impudent angle and led the two years of toffee old through the ring .
fenton was praised of the juroren for its natural capacities in the contact with the pony , that would lie far over its age .
and toffee received best note for its appearance and its personality .
fenton had got toffee last march as a gift to its third birthday and had practiced since then every day with the shetland pony .
its mother , donna , 30 , said : &quot; fenton and toffee are a magnificent team &quot; .
they had to begin and went against the entire participant field with gold cup and rosette of the place .
it was first the second time that it had participated with toffee in a competition , and we were enthused everyone when it won .
perfectly strange in the arenas considered it to be so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with it .
the boy small out of the village nantyglo in the vicinity of ebbw vale , south whale , follows in the footprints of its aunt sharon howells that for more than ten years horses has shown .
howells told : &quot; the entire audience was how galvanizes and everyone have it fired up and geklatscht &quot; .
it ran on sand the entire length of the arenas and although it looked so minutely , performed it fantastic work .
fenton is crazy after animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens around which he is concerned .
so how it is started , it will not last long , is until it on the &quot; horses of the year &quot; -show – and i am certain me that it will do well .
a speaker of the annual horse show said : &quot; fenton is first three , but he knows , like he with its pony go around must &quot; .
together they are a crazy team .
the juroren valued fenton and toffee after that how well they would have struck itself and would have presented in the show ring .
they pay attention to good collaboration between pony and leader – and there were fenton and toffee the best in the ring .
i am certain that fentons contributed sweet clothing its part in addition , that fit really perfectly to the occasion .

the prices lay covered on a table and were circumscribed humorous before they were delivered at the winners .
under the visitors of the breakfast round , also mayor candidate mixed himself novel waizenegger .
one could name it the dostojewski of the usa .
philip k. was thick a god searcher , a metaphysics , its novels and stories have also something serial .
stunningly the relations in the Äußeren : the pricking eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , how fjodor m. dostojewski with its massive oeuvre as an ergründer and apologet of the russian soul to understand is , reads one philip k. thickly as an american prophet , that counts in the own country thoroughly somewhat .
some titles appeared in the heyne publishing house , the haffmans cassette with the 118 stories banishes zweitausendeins .
thickly america explains - the empire of the breathtaking technical progress , paired with paranoia , security delusion and the belief , selects to be .
thickly had read god experiences , its late books like a mixture out of the revelation of the johannes and a computer manual .
perhaps it was displaced , had added drugs to its brain .
it understood , early already that the computers divinitäten are .
it wrote a theology of the computer and asked , what distinguishes a person from a machine , the creator of its creature .
that is the &quot; blade runner &quot; -problem .
the killing .
a master of the science fiction .
a fantastic author .
film directors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven game mountain inspired its stories .
this story is now especially significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; comes from the year 1956 , it exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunals .
the principle of the &quot; prä crime &quot; is developed here , &quot; pre crime &quot; , therefore that what in the meantime more or less official doctrine of the white house is .
in dicks world , that is similar our frightening to that , mutants view into the future - and the police grasps to .
&quot; we grasp individuen , that against no law at all offend have &quot; , says the boss of the authority .
&quot; we snatch us it yet before they can &quot; commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our company , there are have no felons , for that we a punishment warehouse of full pesudoverbrecher &quot; . they read time currents .
they suppose that dredge happens , and prevent that the criminal thought is transferred into the deed .
dicks story causes like the blueprint for the anti-terror-laws and the monitor intoxication of the nsa .
antizipation of the attack : so also obamas drones philosophy and -practice functions .
but dicks story is not over yet .
the police boss laments that there would be no more separation of powers , the military controls the everyday life - and what remaining is of the country .
then the Überwacher itself is supervised and is transported a future crime .
the system turns through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it invents its own prerequisites .
errors and victim takes not only in purchase , but rather constructs themselves on that up .
the system creates the danger that fights it .
philip k. thickly read is named , again and again to come the truth more closely .

profit losses in bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
the canadian airplane manufacturer and railroad manufacturer bombardier inc reported on thursday a 15-percent decline of the net profit after he had run through retrograde orders and extradition in airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railroad branch under pressure .
published bomb with seat in montreal also no flight test data for its brand-new airplane of the cseries and delivered no new information about whether the airplane could go in accordance with the ambitious timetable in the next september into the commercial utilization .
on the boy distance flight of the test airplane one and a half months ago only three further starts followed until now what lets questionably appear it , whether the test phase passes planned how .
the results remained behind the prognoses back and led to a stock market crash of more than eight percent at the stock exchange of toronto .
cameron doerksen , analyst in nationally bank financial , sank to on thursday its estimation of &quot; outperform &quot; &quot; sector perform &quot; in the regard on that that the share in the next between one and two quarters possesses a limited course potential .
&quot; to be sure became weaker delivery numbers in airplanes most extensive expects , but of the margin development in the carrier area are we very clearly disappoints &quot; , said doerksen into a customer letter .
we are the view that bombardier will receive new orders for the cseries , if the test program yelled at before for the airplane .
if to be sure in the coming months no new orders are announced , let &apos;s expect that the market becomes vis-à-vis the program more sceptically .
bomb hopes that the airplane row of the cseries can catapult the business into the lower market segment , that is dominated presently by boeing and airbus .
the first test airplane was introduced in march the public and flew to month-long delays for the first time in september .
yet previously binding orders are for the cseries with 177 moderate because potential buyers would like to wait and see for the results of the flight tests , whether the statements of the business are with respect to fuel efficiency and kosteneinsparpotenzial of the new nozzle traffic airplane correct .
presently there are altogether 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and companies .
chairman of the board pierre beaudoin gives itself confidently that bombardier would reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial utilization of the jet .
the business management assured on thursday vis-à-vis analysts and media moreover , who would lie program in the appointment plan .
&quot; the test airplane more long on the ground remained than expects &quot; , beaudoin did not say in a telephone conference and joined had been thereto , during the standing time of the airplane ground tests and software updates prepared .
every manufacturer plans differently .
we concluded to undertake a first flight and to suspend then a revision period , what we did also .
that happens during the entire flight program .
the second of five test airplanes would start presumably in the next weeks , the remaining shortly after that , was named it of business side .
nevertheless analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the boy distance flight the first customer can take an airplane of the cseries in operation .
bomb explained , would review it the planning for the starting ( ice ) and would update this in the next months .
&quot; the slow ahead step the flight test – also if it obviously bombardiers of internal planning correspond – strengthens our view , that itself the starting on the first quarter 2015 shifts &quot; , said doerksen .
in the third quarter with end on the 30th of september , bombardiers net profit fell on 147 million dollars and / or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and / or 9 cents per share in the previous year .
the adapted profit per share amounts to unchanged 9 cents .
the revenue gave way negligibly and sank to dollars of 4.2 4.1 billion .
analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of 4.56 billion dollars , so thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
that worldwide fourth largest airplane manufacturer indicates had delivered , he in this quarter 45 airplanes , a decline of 57 in the last year .
the net orders fell of 83 airplanes on 26 .
the orders in hand in the air branch and space flight branch amounted to on the 30th of september 32.9 billions of dollar and was therewith unchanged vis-à-vis the 31st of december .
&quot; in the area of aviation and space flight lay the results in the frame of our specification , but the low incoming orders and the market ratios altogether were disappointing &quot; , said beaudoin .
the revenue in the air branch and space flight branch fell around 13 percent on two billion dollars .
bomb , the railroad manufacturer largest worldwide , announced that the revenue in this branch climbed around nearly eleven percent on 2.1 billion dollars .
the orders in hand in the carrier branch amounted to on the 30th of september 32.6 billions of dollar and easily was increased therewith vis-à-vis the 31st of december .
the profit margin in the area of carrier was impaired through settlement problems in some large contracts .
according to business management , there will be new specification for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trade on thursday the bombardier share gave way around 8.5 percent and was about 4.83 canadian dollar after also announced became , that the google head of finance patrick pichette will change into the board of directors .
the brazilian embraer sowed , that worldwide third largest commercial airplane manufacturers and bombardiers of narrowest rival , reported on thursday a ten percent decline of the quarterly profit .

revolutionary work of the church music
to the conclusion of the ceremonies out of occasion of its 160-year-old existence , the song wreath dunningen will frame two religious services with the &quot; germans fair &quot; of franz schubert .
after the large success of the musical &quot; skirt my life &quot; , that the spectators in the spring enthused these years , the song wreath will enrich to the conclusion of the anniversary year two religious services with the performance of the germans fair of franz schubert .
on saturday , 26th of october , will be this extraordinary fair from 19 during the evening fair in the st. martinuskirche dunningen and on sunday , 27th of october to hear from 10.15 clock in the religious service in the st. johannes baptistkirche in varnish village .
the so-called german fair with the original title &quot; songs to the celebration of the holy victim of the fair &quot; , d 872 , a spiritual music work of the composer franz schubert is from the year 1826 and counted at present the origin almost as revolutionary .
the fair is itemized in the frame of the religious services how the client johann philipp new man had it in the sense .
under the direction of hermann tailor the choir is accompanied of the bläsergruppe of the music society cheerfulness tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
scientists were able to throw more light on that , in which context stands that tail fronds of a dog with its mood .
earlier researches had shown that happy dogs with the tail was more to the right wedelten ( from the viewpoint of the dog ) , while it with nervous dogs the left side .
yet now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and can react on that .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the university trient , said : &quot; in humans is well well known , that the left and right side of the brain differently on stimuli react , the positive or negative emotion evoke &quot; .
here we tried to look at this in other species .
it noted moreover that with dogs exactly like in humans the right side of the brain for the movement of the left side responsibly would be and reversed , and that both hemispheres different rolls played in the feelings .
in order to learn more about that how dogs react to the tail fronds lateral of its members of the same species , supervised the researchers the animals while these films of other dogs looked at .
they measured the heart frequency of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior .
probably we will understand soon why the tail moves once in the one , once into the other direction
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have the dogs films with dogs shown – either a nature loyal version or a silhouette , around distracting other aspects to eliminate , and we could therewith the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right drive &quot; .
if the animals saw , like an otherwise inexpressive dog the tail to the right moved has ( of the perspective of the wedelnden dog out of seen ) , remained relaxes it totally .
the tail inclination was however especially to the left ( again out of perspective of the dog , the wedelt ) , its heart frequency and it got out saw restlessly .
in the opinion of professor vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally together through these movements .
it is not convinced rather that the dogs would have learned from experience , in which movements they should worry , and when .
it said : &quot; if one different encounters with other dogs has and that fronds with the tail into a direction sooner with friendly behavior connects is and the right side sooner a less friendly behavior produces , reacts one to basis of these experiences &quot; .
the researchers say that the insights could help dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of its animal .
john bradshaw , expert for dog behavior and guest scholar at the faculty for veterinary medicine of the university of bristol explained , this had not been the first study , with which examined became , whether to the left and to the right for dogs would be important .
last year found out a team of the university of lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left , if they look at an aggressive dog , and concerns to the right , if it a satisfied dog .
in another research project at the university of victoria in canada following did not stand : &quot; dogs go sooner on a robot dog to , if be , tail &apos; to the left of wedelt and to the right to become instead of restless – exactly the other way around as in the italian study &quot; .
according to its statements , the differences could stir therefore that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films and / or the robot dogs as dogs .
a study how dogs react to real dogs , could help , explained it .
&quot; to be sure gives it considerable records for many different mammals , that both sides of the brain for different purposes uses become , but must many of the details yet determines become – and dogs form there no exception &quot; , so bradshaw .
because its behavior however simply could be recorded , it would last probably not long until we understand , why the tail moves sometimes in the one , sometimes into the other direction .
tony blair explained , it would use the chance to a return as a british prime minister – clears however on that a comeback would be unlikely .
in an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of its retirement out of the office the 59-year-old announced its views to different domestic subjects .
since its resignation in june 2007 after a decade as a head of state , blair extensively avoided restricted it to express itself to british politics , and its commentaries usually on the foreign policy and its roll as an envoy of the quartet of the pacifier in the near east .
on the question whether it would return gladly into the office of the prime minister , was quoted blair of the evening standard from london with the words : &quot; yes , certainly , but it is unlikely , that that happened , therefore ... &quot;

pawnshops boom in singapore because the crisis arrived in the means layer
in a pawnshop in the shopping center bendemeer in singapore , janani amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet , a ring and a couple earring in order to be able to pay the school fees of its daughters .
&quot; my husband and i have just a house bought , there sticks all of my money inside &quot; , says amirthalinga .
although it would earn every months 3,000 singapore dollar ( ca 1,730 euro ) as an administration colleague and its man would work also , rich the monthly family income not from , clarifies it .
actually the demand in parts of south east asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – is so greatly that valuemax undertook , where it its exchange , this week the third pawnshop became , that is listed at the singapurischen stock exchange .
the pawning of jewelry is not only a fast way to got around money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – , but rather also almost so favorably like an unsecured bank lending .
characteristically pawnshops in singapore demand an effective year interest of 17 percent , that lies only just over the 15.4 percent , that demands the united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .
pawnshops offer however the advantage that here no examination of the credit worthiness or income proof are required , why loans are possible more quickly than in banks .
for this reason millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families sense the pressure through increasing cost of living as well as an increasing household indebtedness and consumer indebtedness .
after five years robust growth since the global finance crisis and cheap credit based on a loose fiscal policy in that developed seek economic regions families with slighter and middle income pawnshops up in order to balance so in stuttering economy the difference .
this week designated the rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s it growing household indebtedness , mainly through increasing mortgages , when a risk factor for the credit worthiness of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand and singapore have the highest household indebtedness in asia in the relation to the gross domestic product after estimation of the agency .
malaysia stands with 80 percent of the gdp at the tip of the list , a climb of 60 percent yet in the year 2008 .
people economists provide himself also because of the high consumer indebtedness in thailand , that came out this week tightly out of a technical recession .
on thursday the data showed an export weakness existing further and a diminishing of the consumer demand .
&quot; in the end effect means that , that in view of increasing costs the people in the middle until lower segments ( the income scale ) try become , its income to supplement , wherever that is possible &quot; , says song seng wun , economist in cimb , a malaysian bank .
historic record levels in the goldpreisen in the last two years yet reinforced the trend of objects personal to the mortgaging because the people use the opportunity to change the jewelry of the family in cash .
in singapore , about 70 percent of the pawned objects in the 200 pawnshops of the city state are it gold .
the people say themselves : &quot; the gold price sees well from , lets us grandmothers gold chain pawn and next month get back &quot; .
the largest thai pawnshop operator , easymoney , experienced a 20-percent customer increase in the last months in its branches .
the growth in the seize business is so strong that valuemax , operator of the branch in bendemeer would like to expand and 15 further in singapore , not only into the neighboring malaysia – where that businesses four of houses operates – , but rather also outside of asia , so yeah lee ching , manager of valuemax .
the business finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million singapore dollar that took in it this week with the stock exchange listing in singapore .
while some lenders had run because of high interests rates into the crossfire , yeah explains that pawnshops would offer not only more favorable interests than other lenders , but rather also not directly the guilt of increased .
&quot; customers loan on objects , that it already possess , and the verflüssigen of personal valuables enlarges not the haushaltsverschulung &quot; , clarifies it .
the seize lend business is accepted socially increasingly as a short-term , protected financing .
also all people who use pawnshop are not , in financial difficulties .
rich people from singapore come also into the branch of valuemax in order to pawn gold bullion and rolex clocks for what they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
to us come customers out of every social layer .
&quot; in addition belong wealthy , that short-termed something for a business or an investment lend , or small businesses , the bottlenecks in the cash flow bridge must &quot; , says yeah .
sometimes they need also simply only very quickly money .
rank nod scold for ski lawn : mane no swallow king
so satisfied ralf rank nod with the current high form of national league table leader speech formed into a ball salzburg also is , appeared &quot; formed into a ball &quot; so disappointed the sport director of that of the arbitrators .
&quot; it gives presently a dangerous tendency , that mane and alan into the category swallow kings pressed become &quot; , took he both offensivwirbler on thursday on a press conference in salzburg in protection .
youngest occasion for rank nod criticism yellow was became for mane in the 3 : 0 against grödig at the past sunday , in that the senegalesen an alleged acting the fate - that to be sure none was how the tv pictures showed .
&quot; a blatant wrong decision &quot; , meant rank nod , that arbitrator harkam designated as &quot; totally overcharged &quot; .
harkam would have contributed moreover &quot; its part &quot; to the escalation between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the party .
its german compatriot defended he determinedly : &quot; there i would have behaved in every single situation immediately like roger schmidt &quot; .
schmidt itself claims to have had no contact with its colleague after the skirmish with hütter .
i would not know , why .
&quot; for i am that , that insulted became &quot; , emphasized the 46-jährige .
in view of the success course , rank nod tuned however a praise hymn .
&quot; for that there are only two words : really well &quot; , established it .
there is not much to stop .
above all the type and manner how the team plays , is impressively .
that should go on quietly so .
there would hardly be kaderänderungen in the winter transfer time .
there are no magnificent reasons to change something .
&quot; except a player steps with the wish up to , that he the society leave wants &quot; , placed rank nod clearly .
of the british government , a study was announced , that should increase the advantages of the hs2-eisenbahnprojekts for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd is proposed to realize already with start of phase 1 in 2026 high speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
transportation minister baroness kramer said , the project &quot; more closely will join &quot; great britain .
the scottish transportation minister keith brown explained , he would be delighted very to work with the british government at this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high speed train connection between london and the west midlands .
after conclusion of phase 2 , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june the government corrected the appreciated costs for the building of the high speed street between london and northern england of 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds .
hs2 ltd the british government , that stands into conversations with carrier scotland , delegated to search for further stretch capacities and trip time improvements for northern england and scotland .
in addition the possibility of a trip time of in the end three hours or fewer of glasgow and edinburgh belongs to london .
baroness kramer said : &quot; our goal for hs2 is a really national stretch network , the great britain and its cities more closely joins &quot; .
we precede with hs2 because it entails enormous advantages .
without it , we stand before a capacity crisis in our train network .
yet it concerns also the connection between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , that is improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state alistair carmichael commented on : &quot; the current announcement is a good message for scotland &quot; .
in the name of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael requested to support &quot; unmistakable &quot; the scottish linking into the hs2-netzwerk .
brown said : &quot; the high speed train connection rescues the potential of enormous economic advantages for scotland , simultaneously delivers however also the economic strength of scotland an argument for fast train connections throughout great britain &quot; .
therefore we are delighted when partners of the british government to work and to examine the option for a high speed train connection in scotland , that creates advantages for everyone and supplements the connection glasgow edinburgh , that the scottish government already plans .
i am happy on that to test the investigation report with the british ministers in the next year and to conclude jointly the next steps .
living with future perspective
actually waltraud lives raced dreamlike .
your house lies in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with much green , an old tree existence , nice neighbor and also not all too much traffic .
into the city are it only a few minutes with public transportation .
do &quot; you have hopefully no fear of spiders &quot; ? , asks raced and shows waltraud on a fat spider at the door frame .
i have sought myself already for some time a new dwelling for my husband and .
but you know yes how difficult that in stuttgart is .
the reason is to be sure no spider phobia , but rather the worry to be able to master in the age the many stairs to the house and in the dwelling no longer , explains it .
moreover : since a meniskus operation , the mittfünfzigerin learned must at the own body , what means it to move with handicap from floor to floor .
did recently first a book of it appear &apos; happily live to the subject in the age - which accustomed form is the best for me &apos; ? .
&apos;our dwelling is the best example for that , what in the age not at does all go &apos; , begins it to tell .
when it pulled before more than 20 years with its man into the maisonette dwelling , it was simply only a beautiful dwelling middle in the green .
today with middle fifty waltraud thinks raced differently about that .
it knows however also that it belongs to the few people , who explain himself generally with the subject &apos; living in the age &apos; .
that displace it as long as it goes .
old always only the other become &apos; , says it smiling .
first if the sorrow pressure is really large , would make one himself thought .
&apos;then can it be however also already too late &apos; , raced .
in its book , the interior architect introduces 17 accustomed models for an even certain living in the age .
&apos;which accustomed form one however selects , is always an individualentscheidung &apos; , explains it .
there is not d i e solution for the age .
even who the age quiet seat in the tuscany or the bretagne afford could , always should consider that it could become also sick .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language become isolated also in the dolce vita , &apos; gives the reference book author of evacuation willing to consider .
under its models , classic care models , alternative accustomed forms or the often quoted pensioner wg are found .
in the age , every has so its tics and quirks
&apos;for me would be so a shared apartment however nothing &apos; , means it with a wink .
already not at all like in a student wg with a joint bath and a kitchen .
&apos;in the age needs one simply also its withdrawal rooms &apos; , raced .
the book author does not want to exclude that a senior shared apartment can function nevertheless , nevertheless .

cocaine dependent lawyer who warned drug baron against police ascertainment must into the prison
basharat ditta , 42 , transmitted information at underworld size neil scarborough
the lawyer had could come anxiety , its secret drug addiction at the light
it was convicted of the liverpooler crown court to three years prison
a well known punishment defender , who warned a drug baron against a large police ascertainment , because he had anxiety , its secret drug addiction could be uncovered , was convicted custody to three years .
basharat ditta , 42 , furnished underworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information about ascertainments to its activities in the drug trade after it had been compromised through its own cocaine that which is sought .
that of criminalist as a &quot; superbly &quot; praised lawyers with the nickname &quot; bash &quot; was arrested 2011 in its house after the police scarborough had supervised , that he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .
officials observed how scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , , while this with colleagues was in a meal of the lawyer chamber .
the ascertainments brought to light that ditta consumed regularly drugs of the class a , after in tests traces had been found of cocaine in its hairs , on its billfold and at credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 tried it to procure prohibited information about the arrest of these men on behalf of scarborough and one of its partners .
all four suspects were supervised at that time yorkshire of the police in the frame of a large investigative procedure to the heroin trade and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
jointly with 32 other people they later were arrested after the police guaranteed heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pounds as well as 200,000 pounds in a row of house searches at cash .
ditta , 42 , transmitted information at the criminals because it feared , its drug addiction could become public .
today ditta , that became color works for the office solicitors in blackburn , found at the liverpooler crown court after a three-week procedure in two accusation points because of handicap of the justice for indebted and convicts .
it admitted the cocaine possession in an earlier inquiry .
the lawyer was transported after the police out found in its ascertainments against scarborough , that this had stood in february 2011 into regular by telephone contact with ditta .
two investigators followed the suspecting and saw how he went to dittas house and put there the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black gulf glove under the trashcan of the lawyer .
shortly after it had delivered the drugs , telephoned scarborough regularly with ditta , that was in the supper in the soccer stadium of the blackburn rovers in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , got himself the drugs and then nine communications between both were exchanged .
before court became well known that ditta was a &quot; regular consumer &quot; of cocaine , after in tests drugs of the class a in its hairs , its billfold had been discovered and on its credit cards .
ditta later was arrested , fought however off to take cocaine and said , it had spoken with the presumed dealer because this would be its client , and maintained , its discussion would be subject secret &quot; to the &quot; lawyer .
during its arrest , ditta took its billfold and tried to remove a row of credit cards , but they were guaranteed and was taken a hair sample from it .
in the police interrogation , it indicated would operate , it both would call an office and client under its private address and at the job it at home because of juristic matters .
before court became well known that he had called important participants of the drug trade , of whom he had represented some before , after significant arrests and had informed about that , what the investigators knew over it .
district attorney anne whyte did not say : &quot; a punishment lawyer should better than everyone others know , that one the law breaks &quot; .
ditta is accused the abuse of its position as a punishment defender because he admitted himself too very with certain client .
the questionable relation is not simple that of a drug dealer , but rather a drug dealer who furnishes its lawyer with drugs .
a part of its communications was undoubtedly legitimate , for it was the lawyer of these people .
yet that went out far over the boundaries of a normal relation between lawyer and client .
it caused the police ascertainments so far like possible toward so that they were able to investigate further its criminal activities .
mr. ditta brought therewith its occupation state in discredit .
it stood let certain client to near , especially scarborough , and it it to that its independence was compromised .
ditta did not show each false behavior of itself and maintained : &quot; if i a corrupt lawyer would be , what i am , and information at scarborough transmit wanted , would become i no 15 hours wait , but rather that immediately do &quot; .
yet after the hearing , superintendent lee halstead of the police in lancashire said : &quot; mr. ditta has the step of a punishment defender to a criminal in the moment done , when he began , drugs of organized criminal to acquire &quot; .
its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless kompromittierung and made it impressionably for the subjects of leading members of the organized crime , that delegated it to overtake valuable information about police ascertainments .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards at integrity and must provide in the public for confidence and confidence .
ditta deceived this confidence and tries to take cover behind the facade of its occupation .
the serious and organised crime unit of lancashire led the ascertainments against ditta , that led also to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and justice handicap , what underlines our determination to bring criminal before court .
this case should be criminal a warning and shows that the arm of the law evade can from no .
we find you and bring before court .
scarborough itself was convicted to 14 years prison after he had declared himself to the heroin trade , cocaine trade and cannabis trade to be indebted to the plot .
thirty-five further people involved at the drug trade were convicted to entire punishments by 153 years because of drug offense .
on its websites , ditta published would be an area with questions and answers over itself , in which it indicated , its dream job it when lawyer to represent client in the death cell in america , its given as an ultimatum guest in the supper would be mohammed ali and chance inequality would be the motivation for its work .
to the present moment , the police inspection kempten can look back on a quiet halloween night .
the officials were called solely twice to egg throwing children , who threw this against house facade .
because the homeowners removed this on time recognized and the egg remainders immediately , also no property damage might have emerged .
furthermore probably also some sylvesterböller were ignited in the metropolitan area , but also here no property damage emerged .
a resident in the bishop-freundorfer-way reported that its automobile were wrapped up with loo paper and its wheel ornament apertures were stolen .
to the arrival of the police , the man discovered its wheel ornament apertures however in direct vicinity everyone again why the police didn &apos;t have to become further active .

advice takes track plants into the visor
is the train transition costly supposed to be rebuilt &quot; at the deer &quot; in order to increase the traffic security ?
yes , the local councils concluded .
schiltach must take for that 220,000 euro into the hand .
the germans train the kinzigtal track wants to improve in the coming year .
especially the security is supposed to be increased at the same time at train transitions - regularly comes it nationwide to collision of trains with other vehicles .
if the communities agree the reconstruction measures , they must be involved with one-third in the costs , divide the remainder itself train and alliance .
schiltachs city master builder roland grießhaber clarified the local council the peculiarities of the bahübergangs &quot; at the deer &quot; .
there the city plans to construct an ausbuchtung in height of the tunnel mouth there west of the tracks .
there also larger vehicles , for example such that transport long wood could stand , in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks .
grießhaber proposed therefore to construct a required support wall so that the city could the subsequent street to given time distributors in order to guarantee a smooth traffic river .
this controversially was discussed in the local council , pulled there some räte the necessity of a street distribution in doubt : thomas slag heap brought the mood of the critics with its remark on the point : must we &quot; take &quot; so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand ?
mayor thomas haas contradicted : the train transition &quot; deer &quot; would be used regularly for long wood carriers .
even wood out of the area &quot; cow stream &quot; would be transported partially over this stretch because that could not use the stretch until vehicles long to 20 meters at the häberlesbrücke , because they could not turn there into the main street .
in addition the stretch serves as an umleitungfür those vehicles that may not use the tunnel , if the main street is blocked , haas argued .
to see there be that kirchberg- and lock mountain tunnel rebuilt and rehabilitates become must how this is presently in wolfach the case , could approach the train transition &quot; at the &quot; deer &quot; also for a longer period an important traffic meaning .
the räte agreements let examine , which would cause costs the angedachte widening of the street .
without regard to its was agreed by a majority with the standard that the required support wall is constructed so , with the reconstruction of the train transition that the city could expand the subsequent street direction &quot; railway station street &quot; if necessary for encounter traffic on approximately 5.5 meter .
the reconstruction of the train transition in the tannery trautwein could stretch on the other hand an entirely other problem after , concerns that the driveway into the strongly increasing &quot; geroltzhäuser way &quot; .
the administration had examine let the reconstruction plans of the train of the engineer office breinlinger because it had doubt on that , whether the planned connection of the geroltzhäuser of way would be further possible then yet without .
the investigation concluded that not to exclude would be , that the inclination ratios of the street could lead in addition , that longer vehicles rest .
the responsibility for this carries again the city as a road construction load carrier .
the reconstruction could stretch accordingly liability disputes after .
because both the wood removal and the turning in the current extension condition functioned , one should not agree with the reconstruction of the train transition , argued haas .
also let the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition be here clearly slighter than at the other train transitions because directly beside it the stop point middle would be , to which a good line of sight would exist .
even trains of the central station here should have been braked here already so far that no collision would threaten .
by a majority the approval was denied the reconstruction of this train transition because the city schiltach could withdraw the problem with resting vehicles &quot; bathe from must &quot; , so the räte , because the train after conclusion of the structural work out of the responsibility .
as unproblematic observed the group that rebuilt at the train transitions &quot; before hay stream &quot; and &quot; before cow stream &quot; , for which already intersection agreements with the train were encountered .

the bank , that delivered no commentary to the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information inquiries of authorities .
&quot; our ascertainments to this subject go further and we cooperate fully with the fca and other regulating authorities &quot; , said the bank two weeks ago .
last month near standing people indicated the situation that the rbs the records by e-mails and instant messages , that were sent of and at an earlier dealer , at whom british regulatory agency , that had forwarded financial conduct authority .
this dealer , richard usher , had left the rbs 2010 and is supposed to have become in the meantime of its present position as a european leader of the forex-spot-trade in jpmorgan beurlaubt .
rohan ramchandani , leader of the european spot trading in citi , became this week beurlaubt and mat gardiner , earlier leading currency dealer in barclays and ubs , was suspended this week in standard charter speech .
any false behavior was reproached for no of these dealers .

ubs announced this week that it had undertaken steps against some of its colleagues , after the swiss had explained regulating authority finma , that it would examine a presumed manipulation of the foreign currency market in a row of swiss banks .

coulson used telephone hacking for the reviewing of a tip
the earlier news of the word publisher andy coulson used nominally &quot; telephone hacking , supervision and confrontation &quot; in the attempt to confirm an incorrect tip over an affair of the at that time secretary of the interior charles clarke .
district attorney andrew edis qc declared the court in the old bailey , news of the world an incorrect rumor had heard in may 2005 indicating that clarke would have a ratio with its &quot; attractive special adviser &quot; hannah pawlby .
the newspaper delegated the private detective glenn mulcaire therewith to hoe pawlbys voicemails , and pursued it , but coulson it called also and left behind messages how the court learned .
&quot; according to concept of the district attorney &apos;s office is coulson , that now publisher of the notw is , no one , that before the dwelling of people stands and hopes , it in the act to catch , but rather one , that people gladly with a story confronts , around its reaction to see &quot; , explained edis .
it said , notw would use three procedures in order to research stories investigatively : telephone hacking , supervision and confrontation .
the publisher is involved personally in the third method .
obviously it does not know can be of the second , the supervision , differently it .
how does it look with the first ?
does it know over the telephone hacking ?
it contests that , but we say : &quot; and whether it therefrom knew &quot; .
rumors over an affair clarkes were not taken up first of the feature editorship of notw when , said became to a source that was interested sexually at pawlby : &quot; wasting you your time , it is with charles together &quot; .
a volume with voicemails of its telephone of at least three occasions was guaranteed in august 2006 in mulcaires dwelling .
the investigators found moreover entries on the computer of the detective , on which pawlby and its sister were stored as a &quot; projects &quot; .
at the time , when the investigations ran , the grandparents received of pawlby anonymous calls , in which they were asked about information about it , edis explained .
meanwhile the former boss reporter neville thurlbeck and the earlier reporter james inspected weatherup the supervision of the movements of pawlby .
on the 18th of june 2005 , coulson left behind a voicemail with following contents : &quot; i have a story , that we tomorrow bring out want , over that i gladly with charles speak would like &quot; to it .
edis explained , followed coulsons activities in this story the same pattern such as at other important personalities , about the earlier secretary of the interior david blunkett .
the sworn heard on thursday that coulson blunkett had confronted because of an affair with a married woman , when he himself was allied with the codefendants rebekah brooks , who had been at that time married .
coulson and brooks contest to have themselves with other verschworen , to hoe telephones between the 3rd of october 2000 and the 9th of august 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup admitted the telephone hacking .
early puberty : faster adult become
afroamerikanische and hispanische girl tend to reach sooner puberty than its white age comrades how investigations show .
physical variations do not mean yet directly puberty
there is no record that hormone or other chemicals are responsible
experts believe , the epidemic obesity would be a trigger of the early puberty
the trend to the early puberty is stamped fewer with boy
the earlier cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specialized in child health and family subjects .
should a mother be provided if its daughter already in the age of seven or of eight years breasts and shame hairs grow ?
in the annual conference of the pediatrician association american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , explained the pediatric endokrinologe dr. paul kaplowitz that these early physical variations would be relatively normally under american girls and represented a new standard .
&quot; i spend much time therewith , parents to calm – normally is that no sign , that now quickly puberty enters &quot; , clarified kaplowitz .
obvious notices of the development how for example growing breasts , shamed hairs and shoulder hairs as well as body smell , appear with girl earlier .
nevertheless there was only an easy postponement in the age of the menarche ( appearance of the first rule hemorrhage ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is about 12.5 years , something less than 12.75 in the year 1970 .
&quot; if the development of the breasts begins , takes it longer at least two to three years to the menarche &quot; , said kaplowitz , also author of the book &quot; early puberty with girl : the essential counselor to the contact with this frequently appearing problem &quot; .
time is the most exact test how puberty yelled at before .
it is disputed , what represents actually the start of puberty , but it counts &quot; precocious &quot; if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age by eight years .
in most cases , the process slows down or stagnates – something , that a pediatrician exactly supervise can .
in faster ahead step , tests could be indicated by an endikronologen so that serious problems such as tumore or cysts can be excluded .
there are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense another consequence : the premature aging of the bones that can lead as an ultimatum to growth inhibition and therewith small body growth with adult .
the recommendations for a medicinal or hormonelle therapy orient themselves towards the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is reservedly , what concerns medicines , but it clears : &quot; the suppressing of puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girl soften , unlike its age comrade to be &quot; .
the other large problem is intelligible : parents would not want simply that its very young daughters have the period .
&quot; you provide yourself because of the pregnancy risk or about , like it the hygienic side handle &quot; , said kaplowitz .
&quot; it was a shock &quot; , remembers a woman whose daughter with ten got its days .
also if there were first signs and had spoken we over menstruation , emotionally was not prepared it .
it came frightens and excited of the school home because it was that not until its circle of friends .
there are many comprehensively published theories over the causes of premature puberty .
no conclusive proofs exist yet for that that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causal .
boy come similar to girl earlier into puberty .
kaplowitz is convincing would be the view , that premise the epidemic of the obesity .
it supported the execution of a study in 2001 over girl in the age of six to nine years , who produces a context between body fat and the entrance into puberty .
other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
in this country , afroamerikanische and hispanische girl reach tendency sooner puberty than its white age comrades .
there are for that different explanations .
globally an early puberty of all possible things seems influenced to be , of economy conditions over the climate to the genes .
a further riddle : although boy the face hair and shame hair already earlier are awake , the trend to a complete earlier puberty is not stamped so like with girl .
other physicians on the aap conference underlined the complexity of the subject .
the emerging of akne and pubic hair is spread even in baby and infants .
&quot; we must be careful , like we the true start of puberty identify &quot; , said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endokrinologe at the goryeb children &apos;s it hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to be advised of its pediatrician how they should speak with its child .
&quot; that can mean , that one earlier than an expected a conversation lead must &quot; , advised kaplowitz .
if one remains quiet , the child reacts normally good .
girl , who early erblühen , need the insurance , that is the process a normal part of life , even if it enters thought earlier than .

israeli military aircraft attack goal in syria , so official sources
israeli fighter planes would have attacked thursday night a goal in the syrian harbor latakia , confirmed a leading government colleague vis-à-vis fox news .
the official did not clarify said , what the goal had been , however , it had been at least one .
according to associated press , it concerned in the goal russian sa-125-raketen .
at least twice israel carried out this year already air blows on rocket deliveries in syria .
before the revierderby against schalke , traveled too bvb followers with lamp rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the veltins arenas .
borussia dortmund announced thereupon hard consequences .
the friday ago games of the soccer national league against the vfb stuttgart reacted the ultras with a being quiet - first of all .
it was whistled offered itself an unaccustomed , almost already ghostly acoustics , that until shortly before that at the national league game between the german vice master borussia dortmund and the vfb stuttgart in the signal iduna park to the spectator .
to hear were the guest fans with its songs predominantly .
the south platform on the other hand where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - bvb fans stand , presented itself first of all extraordinarily quietly : no songs , no battle calls .
the podium of the capo that otherwise the joint anfeuerung coordinates remained unoccupied .
and in front on the platform , a large flag with inscription &quot; section stadium ban &quot; blew solitarily .
only as goalkeeper novel meadow fur such as always as the first bvb player the place entered , surged short-term jubilation up .
when its team colleagues followed , there were loud song and blowing scarves - however by far everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south platform , did nothing move .
also that stadium speaker norbert dickel itemized once again the positive experiences of the last days - derbysieg , victory over arsenal , contract extension of trainer jürgen klopp - , did not provide for celebration mood .
first five minutes before that its podium whistled at erklomm of the capo - and that until strain tangible there quite with hands discharged lived queried in a loud scream , when dickel how the mood on the ranks in the stadium .
as last was like always the south platform at the row - and finally here again how was lived the loudest place in the stadium .
and at the latest as with whistled at of the south platform the loud request &quot; derbysieger stands on &quot; came , was again all like always .
the being quiet before was well a reaction to the events of the past days .
directly before revierderby in the fc schalke 04 , some of the traveled too bvb followers had fired lamp rockets into the spectator ranks and on the place - and at the same time almost goalkeeper novel meadow fur encountered .
the game was whistled at because of the chaotic scenes belatedly .
bvb boss hans joachim watzke had received the tip of that dortmund ultras thereupon in its office - and believes one watzkes words , was this for the fan representatives a rather uncomfortable appointment .
&quot; it becomes for the entire ultra movement massive incisions give &quot; , announced the bvb boss on thursday evening on a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an urgent measure , watzke prohibited the ultras a choreography for the home game against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; that have i forbidden &quot; , explained it .
we cannot abandon the zero-tolerance-politics in things pyrotechnik .

otherwise , so watzke , would determine the bvb until end of the coming week a sanction .
&quot; that becomes incisively &quot; , assured watzke .
one may be strained how the reaction to the south platform fall out then .
what does with my e-mail happen underway ?
actually electronic letter is named e-mail .
did e-mail become in the design of the internet service similar to at the conventional postal service technically the letter secret transferred ?
in the philosophy of the early internet services stood to make in the foreground , communication possible .
therefore one did not respect in the basic technical protocols on that to create a stable foundation for an anhörsicheren correspondence .
therefore a conventional e-mail corresponds sooner an open postcard than a sealed letter .
does if user &quot; anna &quot; send at &quot; benni &quot; a mail , the computers of both then directly are connected ?
the e-mail-program or the browser of anna sends the mail in the first step at the mail server of its service provider .
if it banks for example gmail , the google would be .
this mail server sends the contents at the provider , that benni uses .
on the stretch , the mail can run over some other servers on the internet .
bennie can call the contents then in its provider .
read conventional e-mails along on its way through the network ?
most mails are read underway repeatedly of software robots .
in the provider of the sender is reviewed as a rule whether the mail leads a damage program as a supplement with itself .
on the receivers systems , a virus check is undertaken also .
moreover the providers review whether it concerns a troublesome and undesirable spam mail , that is deleted immediately or becomes way sorted at least into a spam file .
do the robots have another further task ?
in systems such as gmail , the robot determines also the information that google for placing of context advertising requires .
if anna and benni communicate per gmail over its coming vacation trips , google can fade in corresponding links to vacation offer .
do also unknown people read along the e-mail ?
the probability that trespassers people read along a mail , is extremely slight .
that is theoretical however possible .
in firms , administrators have frequently the possibility read along electronic postal service .
also the punishment pursuit authorities and secret services have legal possibilities to intercept e-mails or to notice .
in addition possible illegal ausspäh actions come .
is it possible to protect e-mails against the read along ?
with an encoding after the openpgp standard , an e-mail can be encoded effectively against read along .
with high technical expense , it is also possible , to disguise the meta data of an e-mail-communication so that once without further recognized will not can , who has communicates with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the e-mail-market in germany ?
in the mainly privately related post-office boxes , yahoo and google play only a subordinated role according to an investigation of convios consulting out of the august 2013 .
while the shares of yahoo mail had fallen finally , gmail of google was able to gain clearly .
country church largest germany has an offensivegestartet in order to advertise for the occupation of the pastor .
background is a possible minister deficiency : the protestant lutherische country church hanover calculates therewith that the number its approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors will halve themselves to present situation presently until 2030 .
for young people of today , let the occupation be very attractive and would offer good future outlooks , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in the conversation with the protestant press service .
it is attractive to be able to determine the works and routine itself .
with burfien , the country church delegated for the first time a pastor on a full place to enthuse young people for the theology study .
currently always less young people decide after the graduation examination , to study theology .
burfien attributes this to the process of the entkirchlichung : &quot; god voice is is quiet , the world loud &quot; .
at the same time the occupation of large freedom and variety would be stamped .
i am gentleman of my appointment calendar and can set there my focal points where it is important to me .
pastors could be as a seelsorger entirely near at the people .
they earned so much like teacher and could live well therefrom .
certainly would be paid would have more in the free economy , but for that theologians a certain employer .
that comes the young people of today toward , whom it would concern not only career , but rather around a sense fulfilled work .
according to the country church , that comprises three-quarters of lower saxony , approximately 60 pastors go presently per year into the retirement .
simultaneously about 40 graduates of a theology study begin its vikariat .
in thinly populated outskirtss such as the resin , the emsland or the turning point country could become future it heavy to occupy places .
burfien wants to arrange among other things study day for young people and wants to invite in addition also prominent , the theology studied have .
the theology study offers a wide education .
one can become therewith even president of the federal republic .
hearing before the royal commission : two ymca colleagues before accusations against jonathan lord because of sexual offense accused
two ymca colleagues out of new south whale ( nsw ) had been accused because of sexual offense in the context with children before 2011 accusations against the pediatric nurse jonathan lord were raised out of caringbah , how the royal commission learned for sexual abuse of children .
yet in the opening explanation before the commission , the ymca had explained , one had had &quot; to never to do &quot; in the organization with an occurrence of sexual child abuse .
manager phillip hare was questioned over a case , with which a ymca colleague had been accused because of offense with child pornography , and another with which a sport teacher of children entrusted to the ymca caringbah hall 1991 because of the abuse it had been convicted .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission of assisting lawyer that it had known of the first case , that not however had known second .
it cleared had been , the opening explanation of the ymca vis-à-vis the commission also inexact in the statement , &quot; it would have external examinations of the ymca given , in which the ymca as at frontmost front in the child security acknowledged became &quot; .
proofs before the commission show rather that the ymca was instructed about that , that it received the second lowest estimation of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( upbringing ministry ) in august the year .
hare , that began with 21 in the ymca , cleared would have fails and not guaranteed , the management &quot; of me at downward &quot; in the attitude of lord that colleagues had been himself over its obligations in the clear to report offences against the guidelines to the child security .
lord had been convicted beginning of the year because of sexual offense at twelve boys during its two-year activity for the ymca .
it was convicted to at least six years prison .
hare contested however that the ymca would have a cultural problem , that colleague had held off therefrom to report lord offences with regard to the security of children .
the colleagues stated , they would have observed offences , looked after among other things that lord was alone with children , it privately as a babysitter , sit let it on its lap , said to one that he would have it dearly , and let play children with its mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , whose superior was lord and had asked that for a training to the child protection , because it was provided because of its behavior , stated that the child service leader jacqui barnat , that was in the ymca caringbah the superior lord , &quot; very intimidating and most time very unapproachable was &quot; .
the manager explained , he would not accept statements of colleagues according to what these would not have trusted itself to return its superior message .
instead , so it said , had impaired rather its friendship with lord its judgment fortune why they would not have reported it .
hare explained , it had announced its view to the board of directors of the ymca nsw that the lesson , that has to pull the organization out of the „ jonathan-lord-zwischenfall &quot; , would not concern , &quot; the reporting &quot; through colleague , and the board of directors had agreed with it .
hare said , had been encountered , that decision to press , the colleagues to the signature of secrecy obligations shortly after appearance of the accusations , by the manager of the child services of the ymca , liam whitley .
it said , should prevent become therewith a kontaminierung of the proofs , what had been transferred however &quot; overzealously &quot; and badly .
the ymca nsw would be at the time when jonathan lord between 2009 and 2011 was busied there , no organization certain for children been , declared professor stephen smallbone by the griffith university , expert to be sexual child abuse , the commission .
it clarified that there had been &quot; serious problems &quot; in the attitude , examination , training , training and supervision of the colleagues .
the hearing was adjourned until 20th of december .
tourism : descent to the romans
on approximately 120 meters length is beneath of cologne a sewer out of the time of the romans received .
he who visits cologne , does not pass by at the cathedral .
approximately 157 meters jut both towers into the sky and make it to the second-highest church building of europe .
yet only a few visitor who marvel at both delicate steeples , suspect that there is to be discovered a quantity also under the cathedral .
rainer schulze is expert in things cologne underworld .
meeting place for its leaderships is the service center of cologne tourism direct at the cathedral .
the tour begins very unspectacularly : &quot; we catch in the underground garage at &quot; , says schulze .
in the seventies , the city fathers wanted a car just city , and therefore only that remained stand of the remainders of the old city wall , what was not too large .
most users of the park house hurry therefore today also at the roman remnants past and turn down only its car .
yet who more exactly views there , discovers a finding place detached archeological by metal bars in the park cover d2 .
to see are about five meters ruins high out of handtellergroßen stones .
&quot; it are remainders of the roman city wall , that in the second half of the first century after christ built became &quot; , tells schulze .
before it goes again back at the daylight , schulze lets throw the participants on the upper park plain another view in a dark , depth of 15 meter of shaft .
that is the well of the old cathedral that unfortunately also is hardly perceived .
next station of the tour is climb the prätorium , and here again down the participants into the depth .
we experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the prätors of the ccaa .
a visitor would like to know what means ccaa .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , what on well germans so much like &quot; city of roman to the right and city of the agrippinenser , established means under emperor claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult &quot; &quot; .
and in the prätorium , it concerns the former governor palace , the power center of the roman empire at the rhine .
a tunnel access to the roman sewer , that leads received is here on approximately 120 meters length by the lobby of the display .
&quot; you can quietly a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima go along , if you want &quot; , muntert schulze the guests up .
a surprise still has schulze .
after it got the key at the cash register , it leads the group to a depth of 16 meter , accessible shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath &quot; , explains it .
the jewish community constructed its bath deeply into the ground in order to come at the ground water , that was inevitable for the ritual washings .
until today are in the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins into the eighth century return , different water levels through changing levels of the rhine readably .
the mikwe becomes part of an archeological zone on the city hall place , for which the structural work should begin briefly .
to the completion will pass however a few more years .
country rover series of rally announced
in the interior , race seat and six-point-belts as well as a free intercom are found .
the option of rich of reinforced brakes , a service package with care of bowler-cause-mechanics and logistical support up to vehicle deposit between organizations .
drew bowler , manager of bowler motoring , explains : &quot; the rally customers , that to bowler come , have itself changes &quot; .
they are not all learned racers , but rather people , that in search of tension and adventure are as well as after an attainable way to world class organizations .
we are happy to can and to believe open this way in partnership with country rover and the msa that the format opens possibilities new to experience the different rally disciplines in great britain and foreign countries and to prepare novice for the strain and the reality of rally raid .
we had really joke on that to develop the defender challenge vehicle – that becomes an entertaining championship .
in addition there is a training day and test day in the defender challenge in february as well as the option to participate in desert race in north africa and the near east .
george kerevan : european divestiture gives the scot the choice
a new day , a new fright story to the independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scotland would be required in order to join the schengen room as a condition for the eu membership .
that delivers the cue for stories over passport inspection in berwick and one with barbed wire secured boundary along the hadrianswalls .
in the deed was referred in the strathclyde model to the possible economic advantages , played , that would bring more trip freedom in the remaining europe with itself , but this – as expected – in the headlines no role .
also no one mentioned that the eu member countries bend right themselves frequently its strict rules , if it more favorably is for it .
because scotland does not belong presently to the schengen room , the continued non-observance would be for brussels only a small concession in return for that , what one wants really of the scot .
therefore actually no story .
and a , that came already so in the years , that it is similar to already a fossil : i heard the first time the &quot; independence meant passport inspection &quot; -duck before at least 40 years .
at the same time an interesting point gets lost in the permanent repeating of this age old story .
why should one expect of an independent scotland that it dances after the european pipe ?
why do the londoner yoke against that of brussels exchange , especially now ?
those are the actual european novelties : the large after which war run is plan calm to the union of europe into the coring .
with the euro crisis , the project europe officially died .
everywhere in the eu , parties win at ground , that eu hostily are or would like to throw the euro as a common currency over board .
even in germany , the euro sceptical party was able to manage to grab alternative for germany – first this year established – tightly five million voices in the bundestag election in september for itself and was able to banish therewith effectively the free democrats ( that equivalently to the british liberally democrats ) out of the bundestag .
there was already always domestic resistance against the plan , to create a federalist europe .
the current economic crisis turns out to be sure as a turning point .
because of the cost-cutting policy imposed severe by berlin and the european central bank in connection with the compulsion jacket , in which the respective national economy is compelled by the adherence to the joint currency , are many people of the view , the project europe would be to far gone .
the crisis of the euro has to do few therewith that national governments cause excessive budgets deficits – that was only in greece the case .
instead the euro system nailed its members on exchange rates , advantageously are that for german exporters – and that would like to let german politicians gladly so .
without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency , southern europe with an incorporated productivity disadvantage regains itself vis-à-vis germany .
the single possibility exists therein to shorten wages and public editions – encouraged of berlin .
behind the current budget problems and currency problems , a deep going european productivity problem lies .
as a consequence of the energy guidelines decreed &quot; green &quot; by brussels – a code for the subsidizing more french and german energy businesses at the expense of consumer – , the european industry pays compared the double for electricity and the fourfold to the united states for gas .
that is some paralyzing costs disadvantage how we were able to see already in grangemouth .
all wage festival spellings of the world do not protect the european petrochemical industry before that to be pressed of cheap american slate gas into the corner .
as a consequence , a revolt pulls up , especially in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , the political elite of france saw the eu as a vehicle , with which one hold germany in chess and paris was able to lift at eye level with washington .
yet berlin needs paris no longer as a gate to the political authorization and pressed europe its own economic policy wherewith the marred french economy has to fight .
the result : navy le pens of to the right arranged , eu hostile front nationally won just a decisive after choice and referred therewith the reigning socialists to place three .
the front the most popular party in france with 24 percent of the votes nationally is now – a timely warning for the british labour party that it cannot assume , a split in the right spectrum would mean automatically advantages for the left .
what does le pen make with its newly won popularity under the white frenchman of the worker class ?
it would like to use the eu choices next year in addition , an anti eu-to forge anti common currency block in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu-parties in these choices well cut off – and that is very well possible – , could dominate for the first time such a block the european parliament .
this is the point on which i want out : in not all too furthermore future , the growing resentment against the eu and the joint currency will meet itself to the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will become sooner something akin to the &quot; europe of the ( sovereign ) nations &quot; , that general favored de gaulle .
germany and a couple of its satellite economies hold perhaps at the euro firmly , but france and southern europe will return to its own currencies .
i expect that great britain of this project dissociates itself in the hope to ingratiate myself in the usa .
to be sure interest growing in the pacific room suggests washington that great britain will stand alone in the atlantic rain .
where does scotland remain in all that ?
we can decide to be a region of ( in last consequence ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – why also belonged to say berlin and brussels , what they can stick there itself where .
i assume , scotland could go in a looser european association very well as far as we retain our own currency .
the cooperation with other , similarly thinking countries is simpler in a not federate europe of the nations .
otherwise we should consider , should retain it norway gleichzutun and our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – remarkable would prove – the most successful political movement against the cost-cutting policy in europe and won 2011 a spectacular majority based on the rejection of the proposed ( and undertaken ) abridgments , that the labour treasury ministers had to take responsibility for alistair darling and the following tory lib the coalition .
it would be for scotland laughable to decide now on an independence , to got forced only around then of berlin and brussels a cost-cutting policy .
faa : passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes ( however no mobile phone conversations lead )
flight travelers can hear now its electronic devices from the take-off to the landing for reading , works , games , music and can use the appearance of films , telephone not however with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines that were published on thursday by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in the usa .
yet the passengers should not expect that these changes are transferred immediately .
how quickly they would implement , would depend on the respective airline , explained faa colleague michael huerta on a press conference .
the airlines must prove the faa that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training handbooks of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowing of the devices corresponding to the new directions .
the faa explained , it had received already of some airlines plans , that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes .
under these airlines , also delta and jetblue were .
&quot; according to condition of the plan could we the expanded utilization of electronic devices very soon approve &quot; , announced the faa in an announcement .
presently passengers must disengage smartphones , tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed .
they may start it first then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light .
in the entrance in the country approach , the passengers must disengage it again and may start it not again before the airplane landed .
after the new guidelines , airlines , whose airplanes against electronic interferences would be certain , could to use its passengers permit , the devices also in start , landing and on the roll field , explained the faa .
most new traffic airplanes and other flyers , who were converted for the use by wi fi in larger heights , should correspond to the criteria .
laura glading , president of the occupation association of professional flight companion , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new regulation certainly transferred is – and we work relating to this closely with the airline together – , become both side therefrom profit &quot; , commented on glading .
we honestly are said it sorrow to have to feel at this subject such as overseer .
nevertheless internet connections for surfing , exchanges of e-mails , text messages or downloading of data remained forbidden under three kilometers further , clarified the authority .
passengers are requested , smartphones to transfer tablets and other devices in the flight mode .
therefore still no &quot; word with friends &quot; , that scrabble resembling online game , that the actor alec baldwin 2011 played on its smartphone , when he had to leave public effective a jet of american airlines , because he refused to disengage the device while the airplane was parked at the gate .
and heavier devices such as laptops must be stowed also further because here an injury danger exists , if they fly by the cabin .
mobile phone conversations during the flight remain forbidden also further .
the regulation competence for telephone conversations is not about the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , in the faa .
faa cancels possibly ban for certain electronic devices in start and landing
mark rosenker of the traffic security authority said last month nationally transportation safety board , security expert for national traffic questions on cbs news , mobile phones would be regarded yet always as a risk .
&quot; mobile phone are actual a problem , not only because it potentially interferences in navigation devices cause could , but rather because we of the fcc know , that the transmission out of the air also envoy mast disturb can &quot; , so rosenker .
a consultation committee of the industry , that was called by the faa to the investigation of this subject into life , recommended last month that the government would permit a wider use of personal electronic devices .
in the last years , the pressure increased to the faa to relax restrictions for the use .
critic such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill out of missouri represent would be the view , there no valid safety reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the utilization of the devices became omnipresent .
in some studies , the speech , that forgets or ignores to one-third of the passengers the disengaging of the device , is therefrom .
the faa began 1966 to restrict the utilization of electronic devices through flight traveler after reports had become on interferences of navigations and communication devices through ukw radios carried by passengers well known , that at that time the newest technology trend represented .
new airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as earlier generations of aircrafts , but they are constructed also so and approves by the faa that them electronic interferenzen settle nothing .
airlines have offered already for some years wi fi to passengers if the altitude is reached .
the flyers adapted at wi-fi-systems are also more insensible vis-à-vis interferenzen .
the predominant majority of the passenger airplanes should be suited for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines , said huerta .
the current electronic devices give in general substantially less radio radiation from than earlier generations .
e reader for example deliver only minimal radiation if one turns over .
yet in the downloading or sending of data , the transmission values are stronger .
to the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the device utilization through passengers , amazon. com counts .
2011 loaded firm colleague of kindle e reader full a passenger airplane and made a test flight in order to determine problems , were able to assess however none .
members of the faa consultation committee expressed mixed feelings what concerns the risk in regards to the utilization of devices .
douglas kidd of the passenger association nationally association of airline passengers said would be would be , it the view , the interference through the devices real , also if the risk would be minimal .
other committee members said , there would be would be only isolated reports of pilots , that would speak for an interference about airplane systems through the devices , and that therefrom very old .
the committee recommended the faa to be sure to permit it pilots , to arrange the disengaging of the devices in instrument landing under bad visibility ratios through the passengers .
a grouping out of the trip industry welcomed the changes and designated it as a sensible adaptation for traveler , who would be equipped today extensively with technology .
&quot; we please us , that the faa recognizes , that a comfortable passenger experience not in the contradiction to the security stands &quot; , said roger dow , ceo of that travel association u.s .

television with level ?
also details such as the ph of the meat play a role .
the darker the meat , the more highly the ph .

joy city : hosts take by surprise fast actions
with a narrow kader , the mr. i of the tsv joy city in the schiller school gymnasium in reutlingen against the tg gönningen of the swabian alb had to begin .
the Älbler stood to be sure with a learned team on the other network side .
soon appeared however that they not entirely were able to keep up , also age-related , with the fast actions of the joy city-dweller .
with the hard and placed had trouble impacts the gönninger extremely .
repeatedly they missed the passports passed by simon tavern and eduard schulz cleanly over the network middle and attacks and were in the block defense not to the place .
two high first sentence profits expressed clearly the superiority of the joy city-dweller in all concerns .
in view of this earth moving and game certain achievement , the third sentence was won then somewhat lax and listless to the 3 : 0-endstand ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
because on the 2nd of november with the tv baiersbronn becomes , that clearly was able to prevail in nagold , an opponent more high-performance substantially on the field stand .

they delivered a hard fought over two-hour-match .
nervousness on both sides caused above all in the ball acceptance mistake and point gifts ; also in the passports was the precision sometimes scarce commodity and in some critical game scenes prevented of the overzealousnesses the view for possible point profits .
in this achievement moderate very balanced encounter , the large physical use and a pleasant engagement of both teams agreed in the tsv team of marcus blasutto however throughout .
gechingen : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want the inhabitants prematurely into the planning bind &quot; , opened mayor jens häußler the citizen information organization to the flood protection draft in gechingen .
approximately 80 participants had come into the community hall in order to be explained the planned measures , to ask questions , to express objection and to bring in ideas .
häußler placed clearly : &quot; that in the end decisions fällen the members of the local council &quot; .
the flood , the gechingen on the 15th of may 2009 , unprepared encountered , had been an incisive event , that raised ask that about precaution for the future , so häußler .
a river zone investigation had been given with the neighbor community aidlingen in order , that is now base for the flood protection draft in gechingen .
&quot; the protection if possible many cultivated plots of land is the goal &quot; , so häußler .
bottom put is the protection from a year statistical every 100 according to germans weather service to expecting floods the planning .
the climate variation taken into account through a 15-percent extra charge .
in circles of experts , this is designated with &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water measures , that had led 2009 in gechingen to considerable damages , corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .
&quot; an absolute protection gives it not , but a relative improvement can we obtain &quot; , so häußler .
in order to obtain the protection hq 100aklima , must invest become in gechingen approximately four million euro whereby the community can reckon with country subsidies in height of approximately 70 percent .
häußler referred however on that that there only would be the support , if a total concept would be transferred .
in addition the community would be directed on the cooperation of the citizens .
a costly planning procedure and permission procedure would have to be graduated .
in the best case could be begun 2016 with the conversion .
among other things the protection draft , that plans became presented ( we reported ) local measures in the influx of the river irm out of the stammheimer valley already in the past week in the local council .
in the connection at the presentation of the flood protection draft , the participants used the opportunity to bring in its concern .
among other things was questioned why no longer dams and back stop basin would be planned to the protection of the place .
gregor boldly , specialty plans of the delegated engineer office forest and corbe out of hill home , that the draft introduced , emphasized that it would require the interaction of all introduced measures in order to reach the desired goal in the sum .
in addition one would be held to find the most economic solution , so joachim forest of forest and corbe .
displeasure ruled with residents of the old place , who have to suffer even in normal thunderstorm rain again and again from an overload of the canal network .
the problem is already were seized at the administration well known and first measures .
häußler referred however on that that the guidelines would be for canal systems others , when for the flood protection and this mixed become not might .
the community would be obligated to display the canal network so that two-year until three-year rain events borne become could .
to dimension the sewers more largely , would devour millions .
that newly formed shines opschlag with a new cafe .
one that invites for lingering and coming back .
one that would like to make the name to the program .
as déjà vu , one designates according to lexicon a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling to have experiences or seen a new situation already once .
in the case the visit of the of the same name café at the opschlag in the district capital kleve in visibility expanse to the university rhine waal , it doesn &apos;t have to remain in the pure déjà vu feeling .
in the end the café with the beautiful name has exactly that as a goal : to make an actual stay not only intellectual , but rather strongly always recurring tangibly .
because it is fun just and is simply beautiful .
a view into the thoughts and feelings at the opschlag 8 gives the spectator on attempt a good feeling .
the ultra-modern , but not cool café ambience looks like a place to the wohlfühlen .
here the team with the founders mirjam van of the stelt and daniel büttner pampers at the tip the guest with most varied coffee variants or cocktail variants .
in addition there are precious cake or individually covered fresh baguettes .
the proprietors , both 33 years old , made itself already before the opening of the jewelry café at the opschlag as gastronomers a name : in crane castle , they led the &quot; type lounge &quot; .
of the move after kleve at the opschlag , the sympathetic café lovers hope for themselves more audience .
not finally also through the university .
&quot; where we no certain target group have &quot; , emphasizes daniel büttner .
rather would like to address both student young here just as like seniors and all age-groups in between .
apropos café lover .
the sympathetic proprietor couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment .
the smelling hot brew in the most varied variations themselves enjoys .
expressofan
daniel büttner is sooner the expresso fan and mirjam van of the stelt the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; in addition a baguette - that is my thing &quot; , betrays it the nrz .
there were two events also already in the bright café .
better said one .
for the harbor festival found sooner outside instead of - the café déjà vu profited not therefrom .
but there was also the ringelnatzabend .
&quot; beautifully , successfully and witty &quot; , found both 33-jährigen .
but just not everyone man thing .
perhaps daniel büttner is also therefore no outspoken fan of event evening : &quot; one cannot make &quot; it now once all right .
and with an event , i address always only that , that are interested also in the special event .
therefore events will be sooner the exception here .
&quot; we would like to disturb &quot; the entirely normal business so few how possible .
should be named : déjà vu stands also for dependability .
with regard to the quality of the products , that are offered here just as , like on the team and the beautiful environment at the opschlag in kleve .
the street that develops more and more to a gastronomy mile .
to the joy of many klever , that guests from far and wide and the students who discover the gastromeile and therewith also the café déjà vu for itself .

jumbo manufacturers fight in the face of large orders over seat width
between leading airplane manufacturers , it came to a discussion over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-range flights , what indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the dubais airshow this month .
the dispute revolves offered becomes around the seat width , the passengers in long flights in the tourist class – always that around which airlines strive most , but this expelled room does not place sow the key for the efficiency statements in the newest airplanes of airbus and boeing co. there .
airbus demanded says this week an industry standard , that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18-inch ) in the tourist class , but the us american archrival boeing , the airlines should decide that .
the discussion comes at a time because the airplane manufacturers to sell therefore rivalries , even larger versions of its zweimotorigen long-range flyers , and expect at the organization of that 17th until 21st of november of record orders .
how the rear part of the airplane arranged is – especially whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives – , is decisively for the indicated economic results , that should deliver the new &quot; mini jumbo &quot; -to design .
boeing maintains , its modernized &quot; 777x &quot; would grasp 406 people in seats in the tourist class , that extend are over 17-inch and permit so ten per row .
airbus explains , the competing version of the a350 conveys 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class whereby there are nine per row .
airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertising in the specialty press .
now airbus appeals before the dubais airshow where the 777x with more than 100 orders will make presumably the race , directly at the public .
did recently the business introduce a notice , that could be the start of a new notice war and showed financier a picture , in which three people sit bruised together in a restaurant , and in addition the title : &quot; would become you that accept &quot; ?
&quot; boeing strikes long-range flights in seats before , that are narrower than regional turbo props &quot; , says airbus sales and marketing boss john leahy .
in view of changed eating , habits become the people thicker , but airplane seats did not change radically .
between the early 1970ern when the boeing 747 defined the modern long-range trip , and the end of the century the weight of the masculine average american between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent , so the data of the us health ministry .
the waist circumference of the masculine average american in the 21st century amounts to 100.8 cm according to us american health statistics .
airbus says , its rival would comply with a seat draft out of the 1950ern when the average body circumference of the freshly baptized &quot; jet set &quot; more narrowly was .
have , so airbus , investigations carried out , that covered , that a ( 2.54 cm additional customs would increase ) per seat the sleep quality around 53 percent .
boeing challenges the numbers of airbus to the seat measures and says , it stands to not to decide in the estimating of the manufacturers how airlines form the balance between flight tariffs and arrangement .
the business explains would hang also , according to investigations the experience in the airplane of more than the seat width off .
&quot; it runs really on that out , airline flexibility to give , so that it that do can , what it in its opinion must , around successful to be &quot; , clarifies the flight cabin experts kent craver of boeing .
they would not want that we dictate them , what makes it profitable .
they know its business better than every other .
for passengers , it concerns more elbow freedom , but for manufacturer , it becomes in increasing mass of a subject , that can affect the revenues .
behind the discussion , a race stands around airplane orders with an appreciated volume of at least 700 billion u.s. dollars after listenpreisen in the coming decades , what could affect persistently the export balances of the usa or europe .
how reuters reported in july for the first time , the seat layout is the driving power behind the discussion around the new jets .
both airbus and boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its newest zweimotorigen long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , that 365-sitzige boeing 77-300er .
the statements boeings on the results depend partially therefrom that the 777x with its ten seats is compared per row to the original design by nine seats in the 777 .
the increased costs per unit are always even slighter than in presently related machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; boeing bruises therefore more seats into its airplane , around it more competitive to our products to make &quot; , says kevin keniston , leader for passenger comfort in the european airbus .
on the other hand analysts , full cabins with ten seats say pointed per row in available 777s on that there that many passengers decided on the narrower arrangement , what could walk with cheap flight tariffs .
&quot; eighteen-inch seat width would be crazy for passengers , but the reality is : of an economic viewpoint out of is the airbus offer of the threat through the 777 driven &quot; , says mary kirby , expert for cabin arrangement , founder and publisher of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing offer no seats , but rather a catalogue of supplier out of which the airlines can select .
the world traveling jets salesmen carry even tape measure with itself , around which to check arrangement in the competition .
even if they extol the comfort , all manufacturers offer yet also jets with highly condensed arrangement for cheap airline and regional flights .
airbus offers an a350 with zehnsitzigen rows , sold however yet none according to own statements .
until recently airbus emphasized how importantly more anpassbarkeit of the cabins would be and offered for some jets wide seats at the gears .
without the support of the only jet large modern other manufacturer , experts say that the call probably would explode after a new industry standard , but could distract by the wave of 777x-verkäufen .
the veganismus is imputes according to lexicons the vegetarismus , differs of this however yet on entirely considerable manner .
for during vegetarian permit itself the consumption of creme pie , ice or a strong edamer , stand these feast eggs not on the menu of a vegan .
milk , cheese , egg , next to the renunciation of meat and fish the vegan of the product animal all consumption lets from - also honey is denied .
one likes to ask himself what remains , , but in nearer view , the vegane nourishment world draws itself through a notable ingenuity from .
&quot; spreads are very chooses &quot; , explains ute handle man , that proprietor of the local health food shop , who has ready a multitude of special products for vegan .
also proctor rubbed visits the store in the cathedral lane gladly .
for 13 years the native new zealander vegan lives finds , in lampertheim he ( almost ) all before , what he needs for life . i shifted &quot; 1997 my nourishment and became vegetarian &quot; .
around the century turning point resulted then the next step and i vegan became .
&quot; the conviction came however not only because of the nourishment , but rather based on the shoe choice &quot; , says proctor , that art leather prefers leather normal .
it recognized that it goes also in other daily concerns without animal products .
primarily vegan is its ethics one .
&quot; i wants not , that animals for me die must &quot; , speaks proctor the maxim of the vegans from , that extends on the entire consumption behavior .
mourn afterwards instead of castles , scrambled egg or gummi bears , had discovered climbed the vegan products quickly entirely new , the enthusiasm on .
&quot; it is a double bonus &quot; , says proctor today , &quot; actually places vegan its no renunciation , no asceticism there , but rather it is an enrichment &quot; . the acceptance that one would reduce the selection with the nourishment transposition at food option , attributes proctor sooner to the power of the habit .
and exactly these conditionings let fail also many a yet so well meant attempt .
&quot; the suchtfaktor is an entirely decisive factor , that many quickly abandon lets , similarly in the smoking &quot; , places proctor a comparison up .
and objects : &quot; certain geschmäcker are not to be fastened &quot; at the animal .
often the spices or the type of the preparation that settle the taste are it .
&quot; one can however also in other manner the same effect produce &quot; , clarifies the vegan .
to a grill festival , proctor brings along for example eggplant , mushroom and also a couple veganwürste .
it pays attention to a well-balanced , varied nourishment , with which it thoroughly also once heftily should taste .
naturally one would like to have something between the teeth , is that legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but that is not only on animal nourishment to reduce &quot; , so proctor .
health damages up to eating disorders , a further widespread acceptance , had not suffered it .
for me , the transposition had a positive aspect .
i receive no strange cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .
there are high performance athletes who eat excluding vegan .
&quot; my blood values are best , i let me often check &quot; , betrays proctor .
especially before the lack of vitamin b12 , many vegansimus critics warn .
&quot; there animals with lining means nourished become , instead of on the meadow grasses , is it questionably , whether in the meat , that one in the cool trunk buys , the vitamin-b12-anteil is high &quot; , finds proctor .
for vegan , there is moreover the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tray to itself .
&quot; my b12-werte are in order &quot; , explains it .
proctor didn &apos;t have to go far ways for the food procurement .
there is reason food in the end everywhere and every supermarket has meanwhile soya bean milk and other products .
all what i need , i find on the spot .
only off and at i buy something special .
&quot; many people survey that just only the finished products are expensive , but so it behaves in &quot; usual &quot; finished products of course also &quot; .
anyway let the preparation be vegan of courts by far more favorable and less time-consuming when commonly supposed .
&quot; in the house kitchen gives it much to discover , with a couple of small pinched can one good , if not partially better results obtain &quot; , says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , somewhat more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its veganen cheesecakes proctor was able to bring also its schwiegereltern for marveling .
the vegan lends would spice family festivals a new .
that has dynamics if one cooks together , has the one new status .
&quot; the situations , that at the same time emerge can , are as different as the people themselves &quot; , says proctor .
naturally scepticism was offered it however also already .
does my meal taste you no longer ?
should i &quot; now badly feel because i drink &quot; milk ? - in questions such one had to act as a vegan with fingertip feeling .
&quot; i lean the people not off , i am part of this company &quot; , would like proctor no enclave existence time periods .
and more exactly observed the everyday life world appears then not at all so veganfremd such as assumed - and the vegan not so in the everyday life restricted supposed how commonly .
also almost food is permitted .
there is fry everywhere !
&quot; many dönerläden offer falafel on , or just a vegetarian yufka &quot; , says proctor .
in a pizzeria , it switches over to pastagerichte , or a pizza without cheese , all one question of the habit orders just .
the restaurants adjust themselves so slowly on that .
&quot; as i 13 years ago begun still would have , me vegan to nourish , was all much more hard &quot; , foundly can make the new zealander a development : &quot; one must speak with the people , make &quot; it aware .
&quot; if sufficient demands come , are it perhaps in addition tended , the menu to supplement &quot; , hopes it .
vegane restaurants develop , like for example the kombüse in mannheim or the café bird free .
proctor cultivates the wish that also other restaurants have stand at least a veganes court on the menu .
in the reason taken are vegane courts for everyone there .
everyone can eat it , they are therefore exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat courts are on the other hand exclusive , and to be sure in the truest sense of the word , for it conclude other from &quot; , places proctor firmly .
&quot; if one groceries scandals avoid wants , is certain veganismus a way , the very largest part from the start impossibly to make &quot; , says proctor .
the purchase vegan products could be somewhat difficult however at the beginning .
especially if one learns to understand , the additive animal also into peanuts as a color giver his contain can , seems to leave one with the compliance with the ethics in so many hurdles and falling quickly the courage .
not only therefore have rubbed proctor and lars thomsen a book written : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and its alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are buried food however also cleaner .
&quot; gradually one develops a scanner view and knows has &quot; is to be done to pay attention to which signs and logos one it sometimes better small steps as to stumble remain standing or &quot; , knows proctor .
the veganismus , it an important moral tip-off that strikes on the consciousness is .
perhaps it does not create it entirely that one discards its habits , but it at least can teach the consumer to examine its habits critically .
bavaria basketball in spite of first defeat optimistically
even the first defeat in the euroleague was not able to lessen in the basketballs of the fc bavaria munich the gigantic optimism .
&quot; no one can us forbid on that to believe , also against the best team of europe of the past both years to win &quot; , balanced bavaria coach svetislav pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on thursday evening with title defender olympiakos piräus .
we sent the messages : also in munich , basketball exists !
in its first third entrance in the european king class of sold itself the citizens of munich long very well , however simply were not clarified in the decisive phases enough .
the guests created first of all the feat a 15-punkte-rückstand 15-punkte-rückstand point 15-punkte-rückstand residue 13 minutes before end yet into a leadership to transform before piräus gave the game again a turning point .
&quot; we have us incredibly fought back against the twice-repeated euroleague champion , but then again foolish mistakes made &quot; , said bavaria pro yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our achievement , but we want to win each game .
malcolm delaney and nihad djedovic were the most successful throwers of the citizens of munich that had celebrated in the first two parties against the italian series master montepaschi siena and the polish title carrier zielona góra clear victories .
new anti-nicotine-vaccine could put an end to the pleasure in the smoking
scientists developed an anti-nicotine-vaccine , that could ruin the joke at the smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice a life long against smoking .
before tests at the person , even further attempts are required , what can last a few more years , but professor ronald crystal of the weill cornell medical college in new york said , the first results would be good .
&quot; we are very hopeful , that this type of vaccinate strategy once millions of smokers help can , that tried have to stop and there all methods available on the market tries have , but experience must , that its smoking is stronger than these extensions &quot; , so cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so , that it contains the genetic information to the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .
the virus infects selective the liver cell that produce then a permanent current of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain , by what means a smoker no nicotine high learns .
in attempts , vaccinated mice which nicotine was dispensed retained , its normal activity level .
mice without vaccination on the other hand would have taken a &quot; time out &quot; , declared the researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .
the experiments are described in the specialist journal science translational medicine .
earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibody .
the vaccinations so frequently had to be given to the maintenance of the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .
yet the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower , for it changes liver cell in antibody factories .
how professor crystal said , a future vaccine could for people if he would be certain entire , children dispensed become before they ridden in temptation to try a cigarette , and so smoking prevent .
more probable however is that smokers would use it in order to stop .
&quot; you know then : if they to smoke begin again , they perceive because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure at the same time , and that helps them to discard that habit &quot; , clarifies it .
british scientists said , the results would be interesting , warned however simultaneously , it would be even further research necessary .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel of denis diderot convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary detail , is to be sure also heavier food than necessary .
the action playing in the france the &apos; 1760 &apos;s tells the seizing story by suzanne , a young nobleman , that is sent by its family into the cloister .
when it rebels , it is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic waiter and becomes the object of erotic fascination another .
the film never glides from in lustful-ness or sensation desire – and therein lies its problem .
the solemn seriously , with which the film is told , makes it also for the audience to the agonizing pay for shirt .
egypt swears in first freely selected president
mohammed mursi discards the oath of office , but might day the triumph the end the political disputes in egypt be do not mean .
the islamist mohammed mursi promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; when he was sworn in firster freely selected president of the country and began therewith the succession of husni mubarak , that 16 months had been banished before out of the office .

it discarded the oath before the 18 judges clothed into black gown of the court , that has its seat at the nile and is empathized with an antique egyptian temple .
&quot; we strive after a better future , a new egypt and a second republic &quot; , said mursi in the solemn ceremony , that was transmitted live in the national television .
&quot; today has the egyptian people the foundation for a new life put – absolute freedom , a real democracy and stability &quot; , said the 60-year-old mursi , an engineer trained in the usa and member of the moslem fraternity , a fundamentalist group who had been taken since its foundation 84 years ago usually as a forbidden organization by the respective government sharply into the visor .
hundreds of soldier and policemen of guarded the building when mursi arrived shortly after eleven o &apos;clock local time in a small car convoy .
only a couple of hundred follower had met was stopped itself before the court in order to cheer the new president , and in contrast to the presidential prunk out of the mubarak time the traffic only short-term so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually animated street , that connects the city center with the southern suburbs .
as uncharismatisches &quot; replacement wheel &quot; the fraternity mocks has its personal prestige since its victory and a friday speech increased , bring wanted , with which he presented himself not only as candidate the islamists , but rather all those , that the strivings the uprising from the year 2011 against the authoritarian mubarak at the goal .
&quot; egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional and modern country &quot; , declared the mursi clothed into a blue suit with red necktie the judges in the holzgetäfelten chamber in whom he discarded the oath of office .
later mursi to the university of cairo went where it should hold its inaugural address .
it was welcomed officially of an army chapel , listened that played the national anthem , that it in have eight position .
the military leader field marshal hussein tantawi was present .
in its arrival , it became are welcomed of hundreds of present in the largest auditorium of the university with language choirs of &quot; the army and the people a hand &quot; .
that in university erected 1908 as bastion secular development by cairo developed in the &apos; 1970 &apos;s of student groups islamist to a stronghold .
mursi discarded on friday a symbolic oath on the tahir place , that to reclaim birth site of the uprising , that last year to the end of the authoritarian domination mubaraks led , and it praised , presidential power authorities , that the military advice of the head of state hunted out of the office had received .
yet with the discarding of the official oath before the court and like usually before the parliament he does not bend himself the will of the military what refers on that , that the power struggle will go on .
mursis speech on the tahir place was full dramatic populist gestures .
nagold : hugo wermter since 60 years in the choir
at 60 years of age as singer , hubert wermters story is at the man song society cäcilia almost doubly as long as that of the herbsfestes in whose frame he solemnly was honored .
hubert wermter stood lived how in the colors of its man song society on the stage .
also after 60 years , the singing with the joke still large in the meantime probably more than dearly won choir makes it .
in the society , wermter was also active , among other things for 28 years as a member of the committee .
for its engagement and its society faithful , it received immediately several honors : jörg turned , signed pastoral advisor on behalf of the cäcilienverbandes gang castle stuttgart , submitted it - there the choir also a church choir is - a document of the association and one of bishop gebhard sovereign honor letter .

the mgv vollmaringen opened with mood full songs such as &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; amusingly , its brother &quot; .
they prepared your honor singer hubert wermter to the distinction another small ständchen - wolfgang amadeus mozarts &quot; federal song &quot; .
also classic choir songs such as &quot; jägerwerben &quot; of julius wengert , &quot; expanse , far away &quot; of hubert goisern as well as the folk song sang go through the man song societies betra &quot; when you through the valley &quot; .
the song wreath salzstetten provided with its mixed choir and its woman group - the &quot; impulse choir &quot; - for the woman quota of the festival .

did the singer department of the baisinger of sports club come with &quot; what isch of that floated &quot; ? of hans süssmuth and robert papperts &quot; beer song &quot; again back into domestic gefilde where the vollmaringer music societies the crowning musical conclusion offered .

frontier airline raises fees for carry-on luggage
frontier airline plans to demand up to 100 u.s. dollars of passengers , that would like to stow on its flight carry-on luggage .
frontier airline intends to calculate up to 100 u.s. dollars for a piece carry-on luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade , also if in the announcement on wednesday to read was , that passengers would be allowed to retain the entire can .
the new fee applies are to carry-on luggage in the baggage specialty over the seat , small pockets further free under the seat .
frontier explained , calculate 25 u.s. dollars if the fee would be paid in advance , and 100 u.s. dollars with traveler , who paid first at the gate .
frontier speaker kate o &apos; malley said to move the fee of 100 u.s. dollars would aim on that off , traveler , to attend in the forefield to the payment .
&quot; we would want this sum do not calculate &quot; , explained it .
airlines began 2008 therewith to demand fees for the first and second abandoned baggage piece .
passengers that tried to go around this , so much plugged therefore like possible into the carry-on luggage , what has as a consequence , that the baggage specialties frequently is overfilled over the seat .
fees are a possibility to move passengers in addition , to take fewer with on board .
o &apos; malley said , would go in the new fee it not really therefore to earn money .
it concerns the most faithful customers of frontier , who would have expressed clearly , that it would become more heavily and more heavily to find place in the specialty over the seat .
passengers , that buy your tickets on the websites of the airline , don &apos;t have to pay .
that means that a passenger may bring a baggage piece at the gate of frontier under circumstances free of charge , that next person must pay however 100 dollars for a comparable baggage piece .
o &apos; malley explained , that changed would become website of frontier and the check-in-procedure , so that the passengers would be informed about the fee , before they would come to the gate .
the new carry-on luggage fee of frontier steps not until the summer effective , gives an exact date it not yet .
passengers scold frequently over baggage extra charges and other fees , but airlines grasp gladly on that back .
they argue that the carrier of the baggage money would cost and passengers should pay these services , if they wished it .
many at the wall street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that the airline enough money take in in order to cover after years the losses the costs of flight trips .
that let until now however the fingers of fees for carry-on luggage .
spirit airline inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for carry-on luggage and later followed allegiant air , also a no-frills airline .
let the only other airline with such a fee be the hungarian wizz air , explained the airline adviser jay sorensen that the addition fees pursues attentively .
it appreciated in a report from december 2011 that the carry-on luggage fee spirit would bring in annually 50 million us dollar .
sorensen , that earlier a lead possessed in midwest airline , flew recently with spirit and was curious , what would expect it at the gate , if passengers would be confronted with the unusual carry-on luggage fee of the business .
&quot; the boarding process belonged to the smoothest , that i in my course in the aviation experienced would have &quot; , said it .
i expected , zähneknirschen and hand grasp would laugh to see discussions at the gate .
&quot; the airplane was full &quot; , declared it , &quot; and the boarding ran how greased &quot; .
frontier follows spirit also in the 2 dollar , that are demanded for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the business explained that passengers that bought lemonade or juice , that would be allowed to retain entire can and would be filled coffee free .
water is further free .
us airways had tried 2008 short-term to demand for refreshment drinks money , made this however seven months later again annulled after passengers had burdened themselves and no other large company was done likewise .
frontiers step to raise fees for the carry-on luggage if passengers do not buy directly in the airline , is the youngest initiative , with which customers on the own websites directed will should .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 u.s. dollars per sold ticket .
that delivers a stimulus to move passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an online travel agency to all companies .
frontier went in this area to be sure furthest .
in september the business began therewith to forgive only half so many much flyer miles in entry over an online travel agency .
on wednesday the miles were shortened once again to 25 percent the flight stretch .
a flight trip booked in a third-party provider with frontier over 1000 miles brings in customers therefore only 250 miles .
passengers can reserve also exclusively in the direct purchase on the websites of frontier places .
frontier controls a faithful regular clientele at its seat in denver , but the business shrinks and loses the business money .
the proceeds returned around 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter how in the finance report to read is , that was published on wednesday by the mother group , republic airways holding inc .
republic tried to got the finances of frontier in the frame of the sale of the company into the handle .

john kerry explains in an unprecedented avowal , the us espionage had gone &quot; &quot; unsuitable to far
john kerry indicated with an unexpected avowal a softening of the defending bearing of the usa with regard to its supervision programs in that it said , the espionage had gone &quot; in certain cases &quot; unsuitable to far .
the foreign minister admitted moreover , he would bear jointly the responsibility with barack obama that one had turned pilot &quot; on &quot; car , when the explosive uncovering of the whistleblowers edward snowden became over the espionage activities of the nsa public .
through the oozed information , the us government ran into a diplomatic storm of the indignation on the part of its ally .
in a speech transmitted per video connection on the opuses government conference in london kerry said : &quot; entirely without question still have the president and i as well as other in the government by some things learn , that more or less per car pilot expired are , simply because the capacity in addition existed , what on the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war as well as naturally on the 11th of september returns &quot; .
subsequently it admitted first high-ranking member of the us american government that the us espionage had exceeded a boundary , emphasized however also that no rights had been abused .
it said : &quot; in some cases is that unsuitable to far gone &quot; .
the president is decided to create clarity , and a thorough investigation leads therefore through so that no one must have the feeling , here would take place abuse .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people are not impaired in this process .
kerry existed to be sure on that that the nsa would be a power of the goods and through its supervision processes many life had been rescued .
it added : &quot; we have it with a new world to do , in which people are ready , itself into the air to burst &quot; .
there is verse eat is a radical extremism in the world , that on that to kill people , to burst into the air and to attack governments .
intercept to and to stop what therefore would be if one would be in a position , that before it happens ?
we prevented actually plane crashes , attacks on building and the assassination of people because we learned in the forefield of such plans .
meanwhile us american legislators will travel to europe in order to disperse the objections against the alleged american espionage and to convince the europeans of the necessity , to collaborate in the anti-terror-efforts further with the usa how the chairperson of the senate subcommittee declared to be european matters on thursday .
senator chris murphy out of connecticut said , he had spoken this week with representatives of the european parliament and other people and be concerned because of its threats to be involved based on the frustration over the supervision through that nationally security agency no longer in anti-terror-organizations .
&quot; it is very important to the national security interests of the usa , that the europeans with regard to our joint exertions against the terrorism with on board remain &quot; , explained murphy , that sits as a democrat for the first time in the senate and is active as a chairperson of the senate subcommittee for foreign relations and european matters , in an interview in washington .
moreover i go to europe to make around there clear that we must collaborate in the terror fight further , without regard to its vexation at the nsa programs .
published reports according to what the nsa millions of telephone data in europe grasped , the relations have to unite burdened us ally although the leader of the secret service explained this week , the reports would be incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the meta data that had been gathered by nato ally and had been exchanged with the united states .
other uncovering quoted out of documents transmitted by snowden according to what the nsa had supervised the mobile phone of federal chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 further country chiefs worldwide .
the leader of the national secret services , jameses clapper , defended the espionage with ally as necessary and explained , let this be usual on both sides .
in all the tumult , murphy , its authority ready recited hoped would comprise the trip of the congress , that should take place this year , and , the delegation members out of both parties and chambers .
the names of the other interested delegates are supposed to be published in the coming days .
it said , the exact itinerary yet would be prepared .
while murphy emphasized , let the purpose of the trip be the improvement of the relations , spoke it also therefrom that there would be some &quot; serious words &quot; .
it said , the european governments would have to be vis-à-vis its population honest over the type of espionage programs , that have used it itself for years .
&quot; to be sure can we our supervision programs change and so the rights of the europeans better protect , this must however also with the fact pay off , that we not the only are , that spy &quot; , so murphy .
in the meantime a trip in the near east and to poland stands for john kerry at the weekend in order to explain itself there with the grudge over the us american strategy in syria , egypt and iran as well as the us american supervision activities .

which prerequisites does to the participation it give ?
the wish should be , to realize with building material in the value of maximally 2000 euro and at a ( action ) day .
in addition the winner himself must provide for many diligent building helpers .
what does it have with the action day and the helpers on itself ?

clive palmer maintains , prime minister tony abbott would have conflict of interest in the parents vacation
the billionaire and delegate clive palmer says , prime minister tony abbott would stand in a conflict of interest in its plans to the parents vacation because its daughters could become pregnant and could profit therefore therefrom .
the mining magnate , that is in a judicial discussion over the payment of 6 million dollars at co2-steuer , set up the statement when he wanted to wipe questions of the table , whether he would be in a conflict .
the palmer united party could control up to four voices in the senate , that are important to the decision , whether the co2s are painted or shortened- and mining tax .
yet palmer maintained that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters would profit from abbott personally of the laws .
&quot; he is in a large conflict of interest , if it around paid parents vacation goes , for if one its daughters pregnant becomes , has he a direct interest on that , whether it vacation receives or not &quot; , said palmer .
the choice commission palmer with 53 voices explained two months after the choice advantage after the new counting officially to the winner of the sunshine-coast-seat of fair fax .
palmer demanded a revision of the process to the voice counting so that this would proceed faster .
tony abbotts daughters frances and bridget .
should these choices be decided two months after the end of the voting ?
&quot; we need a better system &quot; , said it .
why should we have no system , input with which one marches in here , the data into a computer , selects immediately and has then the result around 6 : 30 clock evenings ?
palmer criticized also the use of pencils in the marking of the ballot .
does one use it because one can rub out then the results , if they not please one ?
to vote nowadays with pencils is incredible .
the choice commission tested the option for an electronic choice and published recently a joint legal proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to its politics an international airport would belong for the sunshine coast and that it would become &quot; very seriously &quot; take its new office .
in a public office , it concerns the service at the public .
&quot; we strive after no reward except that of the story , namely , that we in a critical time of this partnership serve can &quot; , said it .
esa decides over large space missions : missions for billions
distant planets , gravitation waves or black holes - experts of the european space flight agency must agree now on two large projects , that want to start it in the next years .
30 suggestions stood are to the selection , five yet in the race .
distant worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars already found astronomer .
whether there is life at least on some of them , knows no .
the selection falls heavily : should one search for gravitation waves ?
investigate or rather the origin of the cosmos ?
search or after earth similar planet and discover therewith perhaps extraterrestial life ?
these questions stand just the responsibles of the european space flight agency esa .
for its program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; they seek ideas for two large space flight projects , that should advance the cause of the research decisively .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is respectively about about a billion euro .
the start will be presumable 2028 and 2034 .
beginning of september met in paris the elite of the european space research in order to discuss suggestions for such missions .
30 ideas were came up for debate , five therefrom now into the narrower choice .
numerous groups appraise the suggestions , hook at the researchers after .
in the next days , a final decision should fall through the scientific program committee .
the esa selected altogether four large questions , on which the missions of the 2007 initiated program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; answers should find .
what are the conditions for the origin of planets and life ?
the exact processes in the origin of stars out of large gas clouds - and therewith also the origin of planets , that these stars circle - lie still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in that all this darkly could permeate .
does and if a star planets possess , under which circumstances life can emerge there ?
in order to investigate this question , the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; should start 2017 , with which 500 already well known planet systems in our nearer environment more exactly are examined .
the possibilities are limited however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euro .
with larger instruments , the astronomers could portray earth similar planets and could analyze even the composition of its atmospheres and search so for &quot; organic markers &quot; : gases that apply as an indication to biological activity .
how does the solar system function ?
also this question should give last of all information about that , which prerequisites there are for the origin of life .
an important roll plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation outgoing by it with the planet system .
in our solar system , these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner .
with the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; , the esa allowed already a mission of the m class ( there is the budget about about a half billion euro ) for this question .
the probe should start 2017 and exactly should observe surface and activity of the sun .
of large interest for the researchers , also jupiter and its moons are .
they want to find out , whom roll played the giant planet in the development of the solar system .
for that the esa plans the first of the altogether three l missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; -program .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its trip presumably 2022 .
it later reaches eight years jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine so , whether that confessed nature laws there still validly are to us .
perhaps also deviations , that could the physicists the way to a new theory of wise , are found , under whose roof all well known nature laws can be united .
how did the universe emerge and from where it exists ?
before 13.7 billion years , our cosmos was caused by the big bang .
next to matter familiar us , out of the stars , planet and living thing how we exist , gives it dark matter , whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy pile , and dark energy by whose causing the expansion of the universe speeds up .
until now the researchers know exist neither , which physical laws in the first fractions of a second of the big bang were valid , yet from where dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , the esa allowed also here already a m mission , whose start is planned for 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe should examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time at the entire sky and should enable so conclusions on the state of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 suggestions will remain at the end of the selection procedure only two remaining .
the best chances for a permission as a l mission &quot; e lisa &quot; , a demanding draft to the proof of gravitation waves has in the opinion of many experts .
under that physicists understand changes in the structure of the room time that albert einstein had predicted before almost 100 years .
proved became it until today not .
elisa could create that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission plans one out of two or three probes existing detector , that becomes all stationed in that .

how the us customs authorities announced , the tube long more than 500 meters between tijuana and san diego with electricity , track and a ventilation plant was equipped .
three suspects were arrested accordingly , eight tons of marihuana as well as almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seizes .
the tunnel had been taken according to the statements not yet in use .
&quot; these cartels are stupidly , if it mean , it could itself under the radar away dig through &quot; , said the general district attorney of the us district southern california , laura duffy , in a press conference before a warehouse in san diego where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered .
at the drug volumes , assured duffy turned : &quot; if your further such tunnels constructs and tries to use it , we are decided to make &quot; that to a gigantic waste of your dirty money .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a duration battle against the drugs cartels .
since 2006 more were killed in mexico than 77th 000 people in the context with the drug crime .
of experts constructs
because of the costly equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the building used round a year .

obamas backing down in the health politics
after violent criticism , president obama made yesterday a backing down in its frequently repeated , unambiguous promise : &quot; if you your health insurance pleases , can you it retain &quot; .
after hundreds of thousands of its insurer received a notice letter , the republicans reproached had deceived the president in the last days , he the american public .
yesterday obama relativized its original promise .
&quot; the predominant majority of the citizens , that a functioning health insurance have , can it retain &quot; , said he in a speech in boston .
as a reaction to the numerous published report to the notices , obama requested those americans who received such communications , to look around itself on the free market after a new insurance .
most citizens could such a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favorable than predicted receive .
&quot; you come a better offer &quot; , said it .
the government designated it as few surprisingly that the five percent of the population that locked even an insurance would have to look around themselves , after one other tariff , because its contract would not correspond after the affordable care act to the new standard .
&quot; i would like to say very directly to these americans : they earned better &quot; , said sebelius in a hearing before the energy shot and trade sow shot of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , that is responsible for the conversion of the affordable care acts , explained that the start of the online platform had passed for october &quot; miserabel &quot; .
&quot; i am just as frustrates and furiously like all other also &quot; , said it .
i am decided to recover your confidence .
this statement of a raised sebelius to one behind its adviser sitting in the hearing of yesterday in the house of representatives was received after a dispute conversation with the republican delegate billy long out of missouri . at the same time it went therefore whether it should participate obligated be to that in obamacare .
long sebelius oppressed after more than three hours hearing repeats with the question why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care acts had not forgone voluntarily a nationally promoted insurance in order to lock self a tariff in healthcare. gov , that she wanted sell now millions by americans .
parents of intersexuellen children can undetermined &quot; select &quot; sex
germany is the first european nation , in which a third sex is acknowledged for children , who were born with not unambiguous genital .
new-born is shown no longer stare man-like or femininely .
after the new law , parents must declare no more sex to be such children , but rather can determined &quot; indicate &quot; undetermined &quot; or &quot; not on the birth document .
it that pressure of parents to take is rushed make must goal of the law , therewith it none decisions with regard to operations for a sex assignment in new-born , and to fight the discrimination of intersexuellen people .
an intersexuelle person said according to bbc years later : &quot; i am neither man nor woman &quot; .
i remain mutilates the botch that was created by physicians , and full scar .
approximately each year comes one of 2,000 children neither as a boy yet as a girl to the world .
they belong to the intersexuellen , a group , that fall under the diagnosis &quot; sexual differentiation interference &quot; ( dsd ) , a collecting concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germ gland ( ovaries or testicle ) or unusually developed genital .
wallis simpson was possibly intersexuell .
the understanding of the sex identification is developed advise yet always not very well , but most experts in the usa in addition , one should use the best available information to the sex assignment if a determination would not be possible , and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before one would decide – if at all – on an operation .
that jack thresher new york psychiatrist dr. , who specialized in the problematic nature of the sex identification , said &quot; would sound , the new german law after a good thing &quot; .
intersexuelle children represent an ethical dilemma .
&quot; many people have life-threatening diseases , that a surgical intervention required make , but for most children counts that not &quot; , said he .
one could a sex assignment without operation of distinguished and then await how the identity would develop .
the scientific data about how a child develops generally its sexual identity , are not very exact .
no one knows why it happens .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
in a report at the european commission from the year 2011 it is named are to be distinguished , intersexuelle people from train oil sexual or transgender people , for its status would not be stipulated gender-related , but rather through its biological constitution , would be defined , that is neither exclusively man-like yet feminine , but rather characteristically both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .
these characteristics appeared in nachrangigen sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and statue , priority sexual characteristics such as propagation organs and genital or in chromosome structures and hormone .
the report gives stopped see itself also an overview over the discrimination , that intersexuelle and transgender people in the professional life as well as over the size of annoyance , force and prejudice crime .
boys concurring with the sex picture have not now a special camp .
in the meantime it is in australia and nepal for adult possible to indicate on official documents man-like , femininely or &quot; third sex &quot; .
in june australian norrie may welby ( 52 ) was acknowledged as person first &quot; neuter &quot; worldwide after a court had accrued the lifelong retention of a &quot; not determined &quot; sex status .
german identification card will have a third assignment , x for intersexuell , so the ministry of the interior next to m and w in the future .
in the neighboring france , sex subjects are still controversial , so a message message on frances 24 .
2011 signed dozens of delegate french of the exertally catholic country a petition that the &quot; sex theory &quot; should be removed from school books .
the us american websites catholic online talked things out also against the german law , with the establishment : &quot; if the world into a new condition tugged becomes , where the sex a decision represents , sexual activity however not , distort we two further columns of the civilization &quot; .
the mother of a new-born out of maryland declared vis-à-vis baby zone , it it would find better if baby would be shown in the birth a sex .
&quot; the parents existence is also without further restrictions already stressful enough , especially if one the sex of the own child does not know &quot; , said it the parents websites .
children need stability and security .
historically seen became children , who were born with masculine and feminine genitals , when hermaphroditen designates , after which attractive greek god whom both sexes had .
yet ten years ago observed the medicine the sex as something , that one extinguish and then newly construct could .
yet in the meantime the ethical bases of an operation are disputed after now well known is , how complex the sexual identity is , and that physicians also incorrectly can lie , because they do not know , how the child feels in the growing up with the sex shown by them .
one named &quot; middle of the 20th century the one , psychiatric emergency &apos; &quot; , said thresher .
if such a child was born , one did not call the psychiatrist , but rather the surgeon .
the ruling theory over the treatment of children with not unambiguous genital is due to dr. john money of the johns hopkins university , whom the view represented , let the sex be mouldable .
it stamped the concept identity &quot; &quot; sexual and argued , social and environmental impetus – like the parents a child raise – interacted with the genes and hormone of a child and stamped so whether a person femininely would regard herself as masculine or .
yet in a case well known become under the title &quot; john / joan &quot; from the year 1966 its theories became controversial .
it advised castrate the parents of a boys , whose penis had been detached in a verpfuschten circumcision , the child very to and to remove also its testicles and to raise it then as a girl .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example for a transformation , what it however was not &quot; , so thresher .
when the boy about 15 was , he changed back to the masculine sex and married a woman .
with 38 however it committed suicide .
according to thresher , there are yet always physicians who would become this model practice .
yet in the &apos; 1990 &apos;s , with which entrance of the internet , stepped surviving of these sex operations at the public , that are not &quot; happy with the result &quot; .
author old so about in jim bruce , a 36 year out of montana , that was born with xy masculine chromosomes , but ambiguous genital .
the physicians were not themselves clearly about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced , he never could lead a &quot; satisfying life &quot; as a man .
therefore became be external organ and the testicles shortly after the birth 1976 surgically removes and was raised it as girl .
in the age of 12 , it received feminine hormones .
&quot; i knew , that i no girl am &quot; , explained it vis-à-vis abcnews. com
i was unfortunate , but it was really heavy to ask questions .
in the age of 18 , it should receive a vaginal plastic .
yet there it was depressive and knew that somewhat did not agree , demanded it its medical acts .
what it out found , was shocking .
i was sterilized in my birth – and none said that ever to me .
bruce was born with a dsd , through which its body was able to produce not enough testosterone to the development of the genital .
after it had learned the truth , it changed again to the masculine identity , received testosterone injection and let itself remove its breasts .
through the operation , it became infertile .
today it fights for other in an organization by the name of interface project that intersexuelle people are perceived as normal .
yet anne tamar mattis , manager of the right group resident in california advocates for informed choice , provides itself that the german law could encourage &quot; &quot; for stamping and stigmatizing .
&quot; many activists are provided that the german decision parents could encourage to make fast decisions and the child on not to show determined &apos; &quot; , explained it .
we fear , that favors interventions .
we think to show it would be better , the masculine or feminine sex and to await then .
yet yet we do not know how the law will have an effect , therefore we only can speculate .
tamar mattis said , its organization would support the australian law , for adult enables &quot; it the recognition as a third sex &quot; .
&quot; adult should in a position be , own decisions on its legal sex to encounter &quot; , explained it .
in the german law , it concerns the assignment in the birth .
that is no battle to which one should force small children at this time .
if they are adult , it itself can decide over its body .
yet dr. arlene baratz , a breast radio login out of pittsburg , that a daughter with a sexual differentiation interference has and hundreds supports other in a self-help group , says , the german law &quot; would authorize &quot; both parents and children .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with masculine chromosomes , has however a dsd by the name of complete androgenresistenz .
because of the receptor defect of the goal cell for testosterone , katie developed feminine characteristics .
it has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .
today katie 29 is and marries ; it works at the university of pennsylvania as a colleague in the child psychiatry .
to be sure it is infertile , hopes to be sure to be able to get through adoption or a lend mother a child .
&quot; the law gives parents room , by what means it not precipitate decisions encounter must &quot; , said baratz .
it provides them the time to make different tests and to clarify things and gives them so time before they write &quot; man-like &quot; or &quot; femininely &quot; .
in this manner all in order is – one raises the child and loves it .
one has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents good fortune .
and one doesn &apos;t have to rush undertake a operation , make lets himself that no longer annulled .
&quot; that closes the children into the decision with on and removes the anxiety , that parents worries , because it the opinion are , it would become not the correct do &quot; , clarified it .
in the end decides fits the child over the sex , that better to it – and that is wonderful .
through it children are transferred into the situation to make the decision itself .
excellently the battle mastered
horst janson is cut the roll of the santiago , the old man in hemingways novel &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , on the body .
janson is even an old rabbit in its profession , the drama .
the old man santiago can show no in the fishing somewhat .
so supplement itself both simply magnificently .
one means almost , the folds in the nape of the old man , of which the fisherman boy manolo speaks , to be able to see .
if santiago sits bended tiredly of life on the chair , that is real in janson .
beside it the roll of the old fisherman is through and through a character roll , that excellently masters janson .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man that does not abandon and wins in the end the battle against the fish through its knowledge and also its will strength .
janson is in far stretches as an alone performer on the stage .
it creates it , that to focus attention of the audience on itself , so that its monologues are boring no moment .
its exertions to pull the fish finally at the surface of the water , are so really that the spectators forget , that the sea consists yet only of blue illuminated water bottles .
director jens hasselmann lets act the old man in the boat before the fisherman village .
in the course of the performance , it sets the respectively active scene into the light : the cottage of santiago , the bar of the singer marie luise favor , that with its songs and its lovely voice the awareness of life kubas besingt .
the four musicians play kubas rhythm in addition and are at the same time guests of the bar .
does desire on ice cream , that illuminate in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur developed the ice illuminating not until the dark – with the help of by jellyfishes .
charlie francis took advantage of the fluorescing characteristics of the marine creatures and created from that an illuminating delicacy .
the idea in addition came it after it had read a research project over jellyfishes and was able to convince chinese scientists to produce the illuminating protein artificially .
the ice cream reacts in the consumption with the tongue by what means the ph is raised in the protein and the illumination is released .
chris explains , that on the warmth in the mouth would react food ice , and would illuminate – the more one licks therefore , the more brightly becomes it .
charlie , founder of the ice cream firm &quot; lick me i &apos; m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but yet in a very early production phase , and so gets one two grams therefrom for 200 pounds &quot; .
that in the ice cream used reacts protein with the tongue in a neutral ph .
if the mouth heats the protein , the ph and the ice climbs illuminates .
we tested it in the last months and appear it ideally to ourselves to bring it at halloween on the market because it has this wonderful lamp effect .
it is is probable the most expensive ice cream that i ever produced , for the jellyfish lamp material four times more expensive than a gold .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but for that it tastes deliciously .
firm experimental charlies with seat in bristol is famous for its unusual taste directions , to which beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold belong .
yet its newest creation should become even more ambitious .
it says : &quot; i would like gladly an invisible ice cream develop &quot; .
that is on and for itself impossibly based on the refraction , that is evoked by the ice crystals , out of which ice cream exists ; but i assume , we find a possibility to create it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescing characteristics of a jellyfish that artificially are produced by chinese scientist

the throw-away society does not think
the night was long , that music loudly and the mood well , but sometime it goes home .
only : in the bellies of the people on the passenger seat and back seat , the hunger becomes apparent .
clearly , for that the one or other cocktails or sparkling wine responsibly likes to be !
go to what more closely lies there , than a gechillt to the next drive in , in order to grant itself a trifle ?
i admit , i am gladly with there if it goes spätnachts or early in the morning at the fast food getting .
a couple of fry , a cola , a castle - and then nothing like from home and into the bed !
yet on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry discos gears become apparent .
for what must be missing one that one with constant regularity its fast food paper bags out of the car window wirft ? !
above all at the weekends , thrown away paper paper bags lie at roadsides and on parking lots .
&quot; why do ? &quot; , ask i me .
are the people too dumb in order to take the paper bags home or more precisely to the next trashcan ?
it is not only so that the paper thing the landscape verschandelt .
paper bags covered also already traffic arrangements such as guardrails and released through it accidents .
over so what thinks purported &quot; throw-away society &quot; however not after , probably knows it not once , what actually means this word .
if one evenings more often underway is , first quite with several people in the car , knows one , like a back seat after celebrated through nights look can : clothes , bottles and other rubbish are piled up there .
there more or less yet also would nothing settle a couple of paper bags - in contrast to the street where no on the meal remainders of other trample around wants .
i see come already the day , become at that the cities and communities the way room stupidly - and the fast food chains for its paper bags seized demand must .

the zone rather boring normally of the street planning has kindles suddenly an intensive debate with colorful alliances .
libertarian allied and speak itself with environment groups itself for that from that the government can use the small boxes for recording the gone kilometers – and possibly also , where it gone became – and can use the information then for the calculation of tax modest .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil right union ( aclu ) is provided also deeply and expresses a row of data protection objection .
yet during one in the congress on an action do not agree can , wait several states not more long .
they test presently how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system , with which drivers pay per gone mile .
thousands of drivers already tested the tachographs , of which some with gps supervision are equipped .
that is must actual a for our country .
&quot; it is nothing , that we only possibly use become &quot; , said hasan ikhrata , manager of the southern californias assn. of governments , that plans a record of the gone miles at all californian drivers in the state from 2025 .
the type and manner how we pay these taxes , will change .
the technology for that is there .
the initiative comes at a time because the highway trust finding that is financed out of the taxes is , that us americans pays at the gasoline pump , broke .
yet in america , so much is refueled no longer like earlier .
cars consume less gasoline .
the national mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per liter ) did not climb for 20 years .
politicians do not venture in high spritpreisen to raise the tax also only around a cent .
&quot; the gasoline tax is simply not future capable &quot; , so lee munnich , an expert for traffic legislation at the university of minnesota .
its state equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs , with which a mile been based pay system is supposed to be tested .
&quot; that places the long-termed most meaningful alternative there &quot; , said it .
bureaucrats designate it as a mile been based user fee .
it do not surprise that the idea finds in municipal liberal accord , for the tax could be used for example in addition to influence the driving behavior so that obstruction and climate harmful exhaust fumes are reduced .
the californian plans set on the system in the elaboration of strategies , with which the ambitious , legally anchored goals of the state are supposed to be reached to climate change .
yet the republican bill shuster out of pennsylvania , chairperson of the house transportation committee , explained also that he would see therein the most passable long-term alternative .
also the free marketers of the reason foundation are done of the idea let pay driver after traversed stretch .
&quot; that is no tax , that in a black hole disappears &quot; , explains adrian bogs , vice president for guidelines in reason .
the people pay directly for that , what they get .
the movement is supported also of two earlier american transportation ministers , who had requested the congress in a report in 2011 , to move toward mile been based statement .
year approved last the us senate a pilot project expensive 90 million dollars that would have comprised 10,000 cars .
yet the majority in the house of representatives prevented the attack and reacted therewith on the objections of delegate out of rural zones , that people represent , who must traverse many miles in the everyday life often on the way to the work or into the city .
several states and cities move nevertheless independently into this direction .
most engagly oregon , that presently 5,000 drivers recruits for the largest experiment of the country , is .
these drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax at the state .
nevada locked already a pilot project .
new york city considers also such a .
illinois tests it in restricted mass with truck .
and the i-95-koalition , to which the transportation ministries of 17 states belong at the east coast , examines presently how one could introduce the change .
the draft is no universal hit .
in nevada where recently 50 volunteers with the devices were equipped , were driver sceptical in the thought , the government could pursue each of its movements .
&quot; consider against big brother and such things were a large problem &quot; , explains alauddin khan , leader of the strategy management and result management in the transportation ministry of nevada .
the people did not want it .
when the test started , the aclu of nevada warned on its websites : &quot; it would be relatively simple , the tachographs into fully grown supervision devices to change &quot; .
there was no necessity to construct a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure , that would become inevitable in addition relatedly to grasp data over the daily movements of individual .
nevada does not belong to a row of states , that hold now after affordable technology lookout , with which the country can grasp the gone kilometers , but exactly when and where .
therewith , so khan , would be also the public more calmed .
the hunt after this technology led some authorities to a small startup business by the name of true mileage in california .
the firm not originally is begun in order to help states in the taxation of drivers .
rather it was its goal of getting an in a soaring market for motor vehicle insurances foothold , with which drivers should pay on base of the gone miles .
yet that of its devices of tested are not work also for the street plans interesting , for it with gps and deliver only limited information that become high loaded regularly per modem .
&quot; the people are rather ready , itself on that to involve , if its speed and locations not recorded become &quot; , explained ryan morrison , manager of true mileage .
in some of these public pilot programs , large mistakes were made .
there are substantially cheap and less intrusive possibilities to transfer this .
in oregon , the plans experiment therewith to give drivers a row of choices .
they can for a device with or without gps decide .
or they select generally no device and pay instead a flat rate on base of the miles gone on the average by all inhabitants the state .
other places hope to be able to sell the draft of a distrustful public in that they equip the devices with more functions than with wenigeren .
in new york city traffic officials want to develop a device to the taxation , pays will must , with which also parking fee can be paid , an insurance only for gone kilometers and raised become speed data by other vehicles in real time , avoid can driver thanks to those obstruction .
&quot; driver would become through that value-added the advantages , that the system offers , the participation motivates &quot; , is named it in a planning document of the city .
some traffic plans ask themselves to be sure whether the entire talk would be over the paying per mile not only a gigantic diversionary tactic .
the problem of the bankrupt highway trust finding could solve official declared in the metropolitan transportation commission for the zone the san francisco bay , the congress simply by increase of the fuel tax .
an additional unique fee or an annual duty could be imposed drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles who consume little gasoline , so that also these pay a fair share .
&quot; it gives no reason for an operation , if an aspirin also suffices &quot; , clarifies randy rentschler , the leader for legislation and public matters of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers make provide itself over its privacy and numerous other things .

both was rejected again .
six years ago thoughts arose to the application of an art lawn sport field , what was looked at generally as the given as an ultimatum solution .

security objection in mozambique grow in view of of collisions between influential personalities
thousands people of met itself in the center maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the country founder and first president mozambique in order to tune in a rare public demonstration peace call .
&quot; we want again peace , we want stability &quot; , said vanessa de sousa , manager of an investment business .
out of anxiety around the future of the country , it has demand exchanged its business clothing against a t shirt with the inscription &quot; we security &quot; on portugese and joined on thursday the quantity on the independence place of the capital .
for two weeks there has been nearly daily report on collisions between government powers and renamo , that are among the worst combats since the peace agreement before more than 20 years .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , that became initial of that of white reigned rhodesia and later the apartheitsregierung of south africa supported in the exertion , to destabilize the independent government of the country .
after the peace contract of 1992 , it became an opposition party .
analysts consider it to be unlikely that the country fall back again into a fully grown conflict , but the youngest events disturbed foreign investors and domestic .
for the quickly growing economy , much stands could on the game , for the discovery of gigantic gas occurrence before the coast and coal warehouse in the northwest investments of more than 50 billion u.s. dollars of firms such as rio tinto , vale from brazil in the next years , eni from italy and anadarko out of the usa into the country bring .
the reigning frelimo party , since 1975 the dominating power , and renamo have given itself mutually the guilt for the tensions .
renamo maintains , the government had provoked the youngest collisions in that it on the 17th of october its members in the province sofala , a traditional stronghold renamos would have attacked .
that would spread escalated on the earlier rebels , attacked and tried renamo base than a government troops to kill afonso dhlakama , the leader of the group , explained renamos speaker vis-à-vis the financial times .
the government gives renamo the guilt for the collisions and accuses the organization to have attacked soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to deemphasize objection over an instability .
opposite afp , that french news agency , said he on wednesday that dhlakama would regard itself as a &quot; loser &quot; , who wants to devote &quot; all its yet remaining energy , in order to prove that he can &quot; force the government its decisions .
both frelimo and renamo emphasize that they would like to avoid a war .
yet the objections increased since mazanga was quoted with the words , renamo gives that peace agreement of 1992 up .
it explained had meant opposite of the ft , therewith it that frelimo would respect the agreement no longer .
&quot; our vision is it , again negotiations to receive and to be sure seriously &quot; , said mazanga .
earlier conversations between the parties contributed only few to the settlement of the tensions , that were fueled by a row of collisions this year .
&quot; we have here two adult men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , that the heads collide &quot; , means joseph hanlon , instructor at the opuses university and mozambique expert .
no of them is is good in the negotiating and none ready to make the necessary concessions .
renamo that presses on choice reforms already explained , it would boycott the municipal elections in november .
presidency choices and parliament choices are planned for next year .
some commentators interpreted the use of force as the attempt of a kränkelnden movement to obtain concessions and financial privileges of the government .
renamos choice successes have shrunk since 1992 while a newer party that will improve itself of an earlier renamo member established movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , probably in the choices .
mazanga maintains that guebuza – its resignation stands , if its second tenure in the next year ends – wanted destroy the democracy of the country .
&quot; it wants no more parties democracy , it wants no transparent choices , it wants no peace , because it the president office do not abandon wants &quot; , so mazanga .
it is controlled unclear , which capacities renamo , but it undertook unrest establishing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south-connection .
most combats took place in the province sofala , that lies several hundred kilometer north of maputo , in which however beira is , that harbor , that mountain construction companies such as rio use tinto and vale to the export of coal .
in june rio interrupted a month long the utilization of the railroad after renamo had announced an attack on the stretch .
mazanga answered reservedly on the question whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted &quot; the international partnership warn , that the things in mozambique not well stand &quot; , said mazanga .
the instability yet had increased the frustration over the government , says fernando lima , leader of mediacoop , an independent medium business , for many people provided themselves already because of the corruption , the dragging progress in the development and one recently kidnapping wave .
&quot; the people think , that the government and the president for the future of the country are responsible and he that one be should , the solutions for the problems finds &quot; , explains he .
omar sultan , a demonstrator , said , the people wanted simply only stability .
&quot; none interest renamo and frelimo , it want simply only again peace and usable streets &quot; , explained it .

nsa explains , would be to would blame an &quot; internal mistake &quot; and not hacker for the crash of the websites
the shadowy nationally security agency declared at the late friday , a mistake its public website had paralyzed some hours and not hacker how online maintained became .
&quot; nsa. gov was today night some hours long not attainable , because during a planned update an internal mistake appeared is &quot; , clarified the espionage agency in one per e-mail fizzled out message .
the problem would be removed at this evening .
let the statement , that loss become would be caused by a distributed finished denial of service attack ( ddos ) , be not true .
in the early evening hours was been noticeable online-server-trackern that the nsa websites was not attainable at least for six hours and is not this for many users also further .
before a speaker of the nsa had explained vis-à-vis abc news , would be compromised the sensitive internal network of the authority &quot; in no manner &quot; .
let secret information be not in danger , so the speaker .
at least a group of hacktivisten used for itself to have paralyzed the nsa websites with a ddos attack .
in such attacks is overflowed the goal websites with side proclamation until the servers are overburdened and the websites collapses .
the cybertaktik is not relatively simple and the attacks serve in addition to penetrate into the internal network of the goal system .
the earlier super secret nsa , whose nickname read once no search agency ( no such authority ) , is found in the meantime in the bright light of the public and sees stopped itself after the uncovering well known become in the last months over its expanded supervision program in the inland and foreign countries of sharp criticism – a result of the secret nsa data that were stolen by the disillusioned former nsa colleague edward snowden and were published .

snowden could state also in russia
the edward snowden earlier us secret service expert could make in the us spähaffäre also in its russian asylum statement .
representatives of the federal general district attorney &apos;s office could either ask in writing questions or encounter the 30-year-old also personally in russia .
that reported named the agency interfax with reference to not more closely circles that would be trusted with the situation .
such a question internationally could be clarified , was named it .
a departure snowdens from russia practically is excluded .
&quot; in this case loses it its fugitive status &quot; , quoted the agency its source .
because germany of ally of the usa would be , snowden threatens there the extradition , was named it further
children should taught get myths and legends as an &quot; examples for life &quot; , means an author .
the stories of thor showed that &quot; brutal power no chance has against clever tricks &quot; , and the artus legend would demonstrate , how important it would be , to have a dream .
let many of the myths be to be sure &quot; by far too wild , too objectionable and in many cases too dirtily , around at schools taught to become &quot; why crossley holland pleaded for a &quot; careful selection &quot; of age-appropriate works .
&quot; i find it wonderfully , that in america myths and folklore already part of the development are &quot; , said it .
i proposed that already for twenty years as a plan .
it added , with authors and teachers , who would be &quot; excessively didactic &quot; , children would become &quot; completely disengage &quot; , for in entertaining stories , the messages would be mediated &quot; subliminal &quot; .
crossley holland , that beowulf translated out of the anglo-saxon and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk valleys is , explained : &quot; one can certain intentions pursue , but one should it if possible in the background hold &quot; .
the difference largest perhaps between an adult author that writes for adult , and an author who writes for children , lies in the necessity , to mediate hope .
everything must not be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an inherent sense for goods and badly .
this must be represented subliminal , reveals become by the story and not explains .
that is the old story of the showing instead of telling .

the travel agency comes now from a settled year profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared to 305 until 315 million dollars in its earlier prognosis .

already now the revenue exceeds out of the stamp tax for accustomed property in the districts westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , that were in the tax year 2012 / 13 about 708 million pounds , that proceeds for irland northern , whale , scotland , that northeast , northwest , yorkshire and the region humber collected .
cook said : &quot; after the increases in the stamp tax on hochpreisige dwellings and the introduction of the therewith connected legislation against a going around can one hardly maintain , high-value real estate would be to low taxes , without regard to the effects of the obsolete community tax system &quot; .
&quot; but this step could some foreign investors more reserved make , what the purchase of real estate in london concerns , or owner therefrom hold off to sell &quot; , joined he thereto .

also if the third league reserve pulled out up-to-date yet no trees out of fredenbeck , malmon in the forefield lifts warning the index finger .
i trained many players self yet in the a youth .
they will be motivated against its former coach certainly very especially by therefore .
&quot; moreover counts it to await , whether then yet strengthening out of the first at the same time is &quot; , clarifies the sg coach .
in order to return finally again into the success trace , the malmon team in comparison with the past entrances must increase in any case .
first and foremost in the cover work and in the shift game , it lacked finally yet powerfully .
also the chance utilization must become definitively better .
therefore i hope that my players freely got the head during the short recess finally .

report : obama campaign considered , bathed to replace by hillary clinton
the narrowest advisers of präsident barack obama considered in the secret , vice president joe bathed to replace in the campaign 2012 by hillary clinton , so the new york times .
the uncovering is the remarkableest surprise of the long expected work of mark halperin and john well-being man over the campaign 2012 , &quot; double down : game change 2012 &quot; .
a copy of the soon appearing book exists the times and it reported on thursday evening that the topberater of the president would have carried out &quot; extensive group sessions and surveys end 2011 &quot; to find around out whether it better would look fading hope for re-election for obamas , if he would let bathed fall .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent of the times , the book draws thoroughly the story of the efforts of leading colleague the campaign and the white house after , nominally the earlier white house chief of staff bill daley , to measure , which effect it would have on the survey values , to trade the former foreign minister clinton against the vice president .
the potential change was an exertally watched secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and in the oval office .
only a half dozen of the narrowest advisers of the president – including daley , the earlier campaign leader obamas , jim measuring , and the earlier leading advisers of the white house , david axelrod and david plouffe – knew over the angedachten change .
in &quot; double down &quot; is maintained had stood , daley at the tip of the efforts , bathed to exchange in spite of its &quot; narrow , personal ratio &quot; before one decided in the end against such a gambit , after the data showed , that the candidacy of clinton would not improve &quot; &quot; the chances obamas authoritatively .
daley confirmed in an interview with martin that the government actually had considered , bathed to replace by clinton .
&quot; i expressed a whole series of things , that one in deliberation pull should , and that was one of them &quot; , explained daley the magazine .
must one call himself in memory that the president had at that time terrible survey values , therefore we thought : &quot; for god &apos;s sake , what make we &quot; ?
while daley designated the investigations as an &quot; offered care &quot; , martin said vis-à-vis anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expense had been operated to find around out whether such a train would pay itself with regard to the choice urns .
&quot; in campaign becomes not so much money for surveys and focus groups issued , if one not seriously over somewhat thinks &quot; , explained martin on ac360 .
it is to be sure not clearly whether obama knew , that its team thought about an exchange .
martin said vis-à-vis cnn , it had asked daley whether its at that time boss would have known over the potential change .
although daley explained , it would believe not that himself the president of the possible variation &quot; was aware &quot; , admitted the earlier rod boss , it would be &quot; possible &quot; been that obama had known therefrom .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; would deliver no definitive answer to the question , whether the political probes obamas desk would have reached .
cooper asked martin whether it seriously would think , obama had known nothing of the investigations about whether one should bathed fall let in the choices .
&quot; possible &quot; , martin reciprocated .
local council is happy about solid household
always if it concerns in local council sessions the household , mayor ralph gerster has laugh well .
the gemeindesäckl in stove cheeks schönach is filled well and has known guilt the administration already since 2005 no longer .
also that fiscal years 2012 can be booked in this sense as a full success .
this became in the presentation of the year calculation for 2012 clear .
how andrea rothmund clarified , the administration household with approximately 7.6 million euro more highly had fallen out than planned over a million euro .
also the excess of the administration household lies with about 1.8 million euro round a million euro over the extension .
to owe would be the excess above all higher business tax collections and the community share at the income tax .
also the fortune household lay again clearly over the planned values .
instead of the planned 1.5 million euro , it amounted to 2.5 million euro in the past year .
&quot; this lies essentially at the higher conveyance out of the administration household &quot; , so rothmund .
because in the fiscal year 2012 less investments were handled than planned , also the reserve conveyance more highly fell out .
altogether the general reserve could be increased around approximately 2.1 million euro on now altogether 4.9 million euro .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and its team for the good work .
&quot; such a work shakes one not simply out of the sleeve &quot; , praised gerster with view of the year calculation .
it and the local councils were happy evidently about the good numbers .
it paradoxically likes to sound , but exactly these good numbers the citizens could come to stand soon expensively .
through the good financial state , the community in the past was able to forgo high assessments rates .
through it again subsidies had been shortened however according to gerster already often by the country .
for these subsidies out of various balance canes , there are prerequisites .
among other things the cities and communities that apply for subsidies must , certain assessments rates share .
&quot; the subject of assessments rates must we us regard , because in the coming years investments stand , for that we gladly subsidies would have &quot; , gave notice gerster in this context on .
geislingen : more than 100 young catholics of the small hay mountain strengthen in the firmung its creed

despair scream of an obama voter
i selected president obama twice in the hope on that that variation would be possible
it says , obama had undertaken commendable efforts , that had been thwarted of the blockade tactic of the republicans
the blockade politics does not excuse the websites problems of obamacare , the drone attacks
let obamas memoirs over the campaign 2008 be a sad memory of that what would have been possible
nathaniel p. morris is student in the second year at the harvard medical school .
i read presently a terribly sad book .
it is a book of which i believed , it would become during the gloomy second year of my medical studies aufheitern and me again hope give me .
it is named &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs barack obamas to the presidential election 2008 .
if i am evenings with my patient written records ready and go to bed , me the keep the books back into a time when the politics was able to steal millions inspired and a speech the breath .
the choice perceived held to a landslide victory and newscaster in order to bring to the attention of the historic meaning of this hour .
my classmates cried gathered before joy and my parents all newspapers that were able to find it .
a young team of visionary was was on the way into the white house and the nation ready for variation .
when at that time 2008 obama changed into the office , it had approval value of 82 % .
and then latch i the book .
to shift again on the present an evil awakening is as if one is torn out of a dream .
it falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – it seem to be one vaguely memory , a sad admonition at missed possibilities .
in the years since i delivered for the first time my voice , changed actually something .
but it is simple nothing what i would have been able to introduce me .
i acknowledge the magnificent and multilateral things , that obama reached , of the dismissal of the affordable care act for health insurance to the military deduction out of iraq , the end of the forced concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of osama bin laden .
also i am the view that the party-political blockade tactic had tipped over too many strivings , with which our nation should be brought forwards : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of guantanamo bay in order to name only some .
yet after i defended countless times the obama government vis-à-vis colleagues and acquaintance , i arrived with my explanation attempt at the end .
i reached a point of political despair .
the republican blockade politics cannot explain why one allows the monitoring of foreign country chief or the killing of innocent children through drones in overseas .
it cannot explain why that gathers nationally security agency data over the private life of americans and why whistleblower are punished , that disclose national false behavior .
it cannot explain why anwar al awlaki , a us american citizen was murdered , without procedure , yet why the public financing boundaries and edition boundaries during the presidential elections gone around become .
it does not justify the results of a report in which it is named , let the exertions of the white house to the immobilization of the media be that &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon government &quot; .
and jüngstens cannot excuse it the inability to sketch a simple website in the more than three years since the dismissal of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether it is that , what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood with 18 , that the government work could contradict that its campaign preceding political .
the delegate office is obvious no foreseeable course because an opposition party and accidental events such as the newtown massacre stamp the public discussion .
yet if i look at the examples named above , they seem selected extensively by the government itself to be .
and that disturbs me most .
i selected 2012 again obama , not because i was enthused over its candidacy .
if romney avoided placed a confusing and unausgegorene alternative there , it did not seem determine its direction and positions to can .
i had , freely of the pressure of future choices , would fulfill the impression , a second tenure for obama the hope , belong had we of that already so long .
yet with the sinking of the approval values for obama on less than 45 % this week the return became into the year 2008 through this book the harder .
it wakes the longing in me after the many promises , that broke up in air .
i read this week a section in the book that describes , how obama had to put away a heavy loss against clinton in the areas codes in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the choice helpers after the decision , he said would have to come , it back on course to its colleagues and follow the purpose of its thing .
&quot; i would like , that we our magic regain &quot; , said it .
we must remember on that , who we are .
five years are later , mr. president , and i not more strongly could agree with you .
the views expressed in this commentary are exclusively that by nathaniel morris .

in pfullendorf , the current becomes more expensive

essential reason of the standing price increase is the climb of the so-called eeg allocation of 5,277 on 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .
this allocation newly is fixed each year in october of the four operators of that of the large current line .
these number the additional costs emerging them out of the energy turning point that can raise it by an allocation over the current price .
the city works pfullendorf form the last limb in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy business had come in its prognoses even from a higher allocation how jörg arne bias reports .
now the concrete would have to pay calculated become before the city works next week its customers could inform about the exact price increase .
