schools are encouraged to a greater focus on math , spelling and grammar
courses in english literature pupils must in future , at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic poetry and contemporary british novels from 1914 .
the audit also found &quot; ungesehene texts &quot; entrance to encourage broader reading .
the combined rate of english literature and language will be abolished .
from 2015 , pupils need a separate gcse-exams for language , and there are strong incentives to choose english literature as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education will tomorrow publish the new curriculum for english and maths – the first subjects that have been radically transformed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , ofqual , announce the supervisory authority for exams , a reorganization of gcse structures , including a new benotungs system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer , said education minister michael gove , that there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; emphasizing that gcses would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
studies show that in english schools spent less time for mathematics – 116 hours per year , or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries .
in contrast , australian schools teach 143 hours a year on average , students receive in singapore 138 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the curriculum , but coalition circles , it says the comprehensive math exam – combined with a greater weighting of bac in rankings , schools will probably encourage more hours .
the curriculum is placed more emphasis on &quot; problems in the real life &quot; , including financial mathematics .

in the course of my employment in these institutions , i witnessed systematic violations of law by my government , which led me from a moral duty to act .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i felt i faced a serious and persistent propaganda which forced me to leave my family and my home .
now i live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum , which gives me the russian federation in accordance with international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and also high officials - including the united states - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance , which is answerable to , as a service to the public .
the spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives , which were aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust .
the benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer ; at the same time , the risks in visibly reduced .
although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government treated dissent remains as fidelity and seeks to criminalise political freedom of expression and should be indicted .
however , the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the government of the united states will drop this damaging attitude with the support of the international community .
i hope that , if the difficulties are resolved this humanitarian situation , i will be able to participate in the responsibility of a full investigation of the facts relating to the media statements , particularly in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports , appropriately and in accordance with law .
i am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country , once the situation is clarified , and i thank you for your efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all .

traveling through the mud , rivers and jungle for free medical care
dr. georges bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in cameroon
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one in 5000 people
vote here or with your mobile device from
dr. georges bwelle is among the top 10 &quot; cnn heroes of 2013 &quot; .
you can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to elect him to the &quot; cnn hero of the year &quot; .
the winner gets $ 250000 to continue its exceptional work .
21 years saw georges bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals , which did not have the resources to help him .
jamef bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near yaoundé , the capital of cameroon .
first , he had a broken arm , but then formed an inflammation , expanding on his brain , causing a hämatom that should affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there was no neuro-surgeons in cameroon , &quot; says georges bwelle .
we would have him released from cameroon , if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer .
&quot; it is not easy , &quot; commented bwelle .
you can run at five o &apos; clock in the morning to leave the house and to the hospital , to be the first one , and it is not first .
there are very many patients .
indeed , some people die because they have to wait .
the situation has changed little since bwelles father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5000 people , according to the world health organization .
in contrast , the ratio in the united states is a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , could not afford most cameroonians the visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
to see his father and so many of his country people suffer in mature bwelle decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his team of volunteers have conducted last year 700 free operations .
he himself was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a nonprofit organization called ascovime travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32000 people .
almost every friday , he squeezed and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain to the villages that need help .
not everything is proceeding smoothly .
more than once they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be welcomed as heroes : a feast , singing and dancing and the best accommodation , the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a cause for celebration and bwelle – with his broad smile and his boundless energy – in the joyful celebration .
the next morning , the team then begins with the examination of hundreds of patients .
&quot; each trip we treat 500 people , &quot; says bwelle .
they come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village – and on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates , a document that is required for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team simple operations with local anaesthetic .
the operations are usually in a school , the city hall or an apartment ; after the surgery , the patients and the recreation area in order to make room for the next .
the lighting for the surgery and the desinfektions equipment is fed by the generator of the group and bwelle and his volunteers until the early hours on sunday .
it is an arduous tasks , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
&quot; they drum all night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday , the team goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – free operations carried out last year , 700 and knows that it is an enormous difference to the people with their work , which helps them .
a man explained that the free operation of a hip break he received enabled him to return to work .
&quot; it changed the future of my family , &quot; said the man .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital works bwelle night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job he finanziere 60 % of his charitable work , bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
&quot; i really do not know when he is asleep , &quot; says katie o &apos; malley , who participates in the second year at drexel university in philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in bwelles group .
he is always either in hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization , so that he can go to these campaigns .
support for medical and nursing students like o &apos; malley , who come from the united states and europe and bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
&quot; we can be in operations , where we help blood abzutupfen or instruments for bwelle dr. , &quot; says o &apos; malley .
that would never be possible in america as a medical student in the second year .
the students pay for their trip to cameroon usually themselves , often with donated medical equipment .
but once in yaoundé , bwelle accommodation , transport and guide .
&quot; he is undoubtedly a hero , &quot; says o &apos; malley .
he dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the cameroonian people , knows no boundaries .
for bwelle is almost no permanent workload .
others to give to a happier life , and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father , he has a great deal of pleasure .
&quot; i am so happy when i am doing this work , &quot; says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people laugh , and in order to alleviate the pain .

pope francis appoints first in february cardinals
pope francis will for the first time on 22 february , appointed new cardinals of the catholic church , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the most senior clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are the ones who choose a pope francis , so that it will appoint the first group of men who ultimately participate in the choice of his successor .
currently there are 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years , no longer take part in the papal election – which is a group of 120 cardinals eligible &quot; choice &quot; .
in a statement , said the news was announced , father federico lombardi , the vatican spokesman , there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as a consistory .
&quot; pope francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the konsistoriums in february in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , &quot; said lombardi .
jack valero of catholic voices , said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be dropped until february .
he explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary so that the number of voters 120 cardinals 1.44 again , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he likes .
the consistory next year is important because it was the first since the election of francis in march this year , valero .
currently , there is a certain overhang on the part of europe , and especially italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the council of francis founded the cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have to find ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
&quot; now , francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he explained that it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that the cardinals francis ask for advice .
but so far we have not been in this situation , it is all very new .
valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals , but francis sponges &quot; full of surprises , so we do not know who he appoints . &quot;
workers rushed from director : seriously injured

europe &apos;s elite is prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention to bring the economy to the table and to define what those who want to change in the uk for prosperity and work , in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey of british economic leaders commissioned and asked them what they think about britain , the economy and the eu .
yougov interviewed more than 1000 forces command from the economy , the british company sizes , sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside europe and focused on countries modernize and grow , while the countries stagnate in the eu .
they want to be favored by the government side , new trade ties with countries such as china , india and brazil , rather than with the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure eu institutions .
asked for their opinion on certain regulatory issues , from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders is of the opinion that control over these key skills should be brought back to westminster .
there was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market , since according to the company in the meantime , the costs of the brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of europe &apos;s trade zone , even 40 % of large companies agreed to the traditionally friendly in europe .
finally , and this is probably the most , our survey of economic leaders that a clear majority of britain wants a course in the direction of change in the agreement and a relationship with the eu , which is based on trade , not on policy .
this realization , with companies of all sizes and leading companies , shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; , which brings a return to the uk .
there is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain at 16 percent , to a change of opinion in favour of the eu in a popular vote .
the prime minister should have no doubt that this survey shows that the british economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the uk &apos;s conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that the business of renegotiating a major shift of power back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and necessary , increasingly , after the eurozone now toward closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation .

gutach : more pedestrian safety
they are not a 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b-33 pedestrian traffic lights at the village car park in gutach commissioned - within sight of the old town hall .
two plants so close together : intention or schildbürgerstreich ?
this question has gutachs mayor clearly answered yesterday .
&quot; the town hall lights have been installed at the time , because it ensures the school , &quot; eckert said yesterday .
the kluser-safe lights both cyclists and passengers and the bergle inhabitants .
the plant yesterday officially in operation was important for the kreuzungs area sulzbachweg / kirch street .
the museum , two churches , park , bushaltestelle , a doctor and a bank , and the traffic flow from the residential area &apos; grub &apos; .
&quot; the high volume of traffic and pedestrians had another traffic to their safety , &quot; says eckert .
this is also confirmed by peter arnold of offenburg decisions .
&quot; according to the latest measurements on the b 33 approximately 12000 vehicles a day , the municipality of gutach , about ten percent of them are heavy traffic , &quot; said arnold .
so is the construction of another traffic light more than necessary , &quot; security here is simple , &quot; says arnold .
a total of four traffic shows had been carried out , a roundabout was considered , but discarded because of tightness in the kreuzungs area sulzbachweg / kirch street .
it was previously tested everything , according to arnold in the choice of location of the traffic light poles , &quot; using an extra for us with long wooden trunks loaded trucks , we have ausgestestet whether these vehicles from the sulzbachweg on the b 33 , without the traffic light poles umzuknicken . &quot;
the traffic light around 15000 euros expensive itself is the most modern &quot; , which are currently on the market , &quot; arnold explained .
the plant is equipped with colored leds that shine so strongly that the lights of the motorists example , are deep in the sun .
and it is economical , too : the older light plants consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three light per direction of plants .
arnold explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
the pedestrian is the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor is testing the traffic situation .
the road is free , is directly green for pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be stopped for pedestrians .
&quot; if a group or disabled people on the streets , the green phase is extended , everyone has a safe on the road , &quot; said arnold .
of course , motorists must think ahead here as a partner and watch the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the green light for pedestrians , rauschte a luxury car - with brilliant red .

my sister and i were allowed to eat candy , i grew late and dress up for the neighborhood .
today , i am more become the halloween casting .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment , and it will probably not do so this year .
but , according to the statistics , i am a black sheep , as halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million , to be precise – to celebrate halloween this year , a total of $ 6.9 billion for candy , costumes and decorations , the american association of retailers ( nrf ) .
one thing that i am every halloween then again , the trend .
the costumes are about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year aufreizende inanimate objects are the rage .
women need no longer sexy clothes , they can now also tempting food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as for men , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet the daft punk-space men will succeed this year in the inst zagreb feeds .
according to google &apos;s most popular costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we have dressed our dogs and were not alone , to my amazement .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year for costumes from their pets , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of &quot; hot dogs . &quot;
as for sweets , we are not squeamish .
americans will spend this year , 1.9 billion dollars , the nielsen company .
approximately 270 million kilograms of schokoriegeln , lutschern , candies and wine gum .
good news for the us trade department 41 million people living with the slogan &quot; trick or treat &quot; through the quarter .

nothing is more than halloween houses where it is on .
they have great names like &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , &quot; howl-o-scream &quot; and &quot; the house of shock &quot; .

but we finally come to the kürbissen .
charlie brown made us familiar with the great pumpkin , when we were children , and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like the gingerbread decorating the christmas tree – something that we have made from a young age .
fortunately , the &quot; baby in the pumpkin &quot; trend only last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us grew up with the idea that the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million for pumpkins , the us census bureau .
the pumpkin lantern , slowly rotting in the front yard , probably dates from illinois , where this year were harvested pumpkins 245 million kilograms .

tripodi denies , have been influenced by obeid
against the former minister of the labor party joe tripodi from new south wales launched an investigation by the state corruption supervision .
the former nsw minister denies to have changed the rules on maritimverpachtung at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , the hidden stakes in three plots of state-controlled land .
the independent commission against corruption ( icac - independent commission against corruption ) has expanded on friday its investigations on the question of whether obeid influencing a number of ministers to extend leases at circular quay , where the obeids two restaurants and a cafe without tender after their expiration in august 2005 .
now is because of the accusation , tripodi knew of obeids concealed interest in the land , after tripodis former deputy leader staff lynne ashpole accordingly on thursday .
in years of talks , which began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases .
the tenants were opposed to it and also wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , extended the leases for the company at circular quay , the obeids annual 2.5 million dollars , without a public tender .
tripodi , who was from february 2006 to november 2009 port minister , had previously argued for public tenders .
but he denied that the changes made at the request of obeid , who had , as tripodi confirmed , a review of the lease arrangements of the government .
a phone down the icac presented showed talks from the august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who had moved into the port ministry , after he had worked in the fisheries agency under obeid .
&quot; was the subject of discussion in these telephone conversations , the preparation of the commercial verpachtungsregelungen ? &quot; asked the deputy commission member anthony whealy tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; replied tripodi .
i do not remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
nsa revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance
on a balmy day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew low over the us consulate in frankfurt am main , germany &apos;s financial capital .
on the instructions of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( bat ) , the german secret service , he should shoot the roof of the us outpost , located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the federal bank .
according to german media that bat wanted to prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , the us director of national intelligence , was again in september that the us has no chance of foreign espionage , &quot; the company secrets of foreign companies in order to steal american companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits . &quot;
but since edward snowden , the former employees to become whistleblowers , began with the publication of his füllhorns at us surveillance secrets , european governments and company bosses no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .
reports that the us national security agency has spied on brazilian oil company petrobras and american data cloud providers , including google and yahoo , have brought the company paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak .
the last straw , the revelation that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone was verwanzt , possibly for the last 10 years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then certainly company lines , potential targets .
snowden has made transparent intensive cooperation between us intelligence agencies and companies .
i believe that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany needs to wake up , &quot; says oliver green , president of the bitmi , small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us is now a risk that is almost as big as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published in july by the consultancy firm ey .
in the documents leaked by snowden was , however , there has been no evidence that the us has the company secrets of foreign companies to own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that certain eu it and internet missed opportunities and should reduce their dependence on the united states .
the companies are skeptical about this .
the bundestag has been suggested that we should build a german google .
i can close my eyes and open them again slowly ...
&quot; that is not how things work , &quot; says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if you have a strong european it industry had wanted , then they would not die 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsidised by the coal on cars to agriculture .
everything , except for the it industry .
however , the reach and technical sophistication of the snowden revelations uncovered u.s. spy agencies have shocked that had the greatest risk of espionage in china .
the cloud computing is a big change , because european business leaders are now aware that data stored in the us are subject to the jurisdiction and therefore are potentially at risk .
according to a survey by the cloud security alliance , a trade body , trashed by the disclosures about the us data mining activities with prism about ten percent of the members of non-resident in the us plans to use an american supplier .
jim snabe , deputy business manager of sap , says : &quot; we will see a new question from customers who have not yet announced a year ago , it is : where my data is stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this law ? &quot;
many german company manager believes that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs .
that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise .
this has always been the case .
&quot; it was for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion , &quot; says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans spy on commercial and industrial level , as we do this , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the company &apos;s management does not normally on the counter-measures it has taken , which affords attackers advantages .
in large companies , employees have long eingebläut that take away a free usb sticks at a fair or the unbewachte sunbeds a laptop is not advisable in the hotel room , to say the least .
ulrich hackenberk , board member at car manufacturer audi , says that for years , belong to the standard practice , before a board meeting of the phones , so that they cannot be used for eavesdropping devices .
the german leadership bat advises to use simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad , because smartphones may be compromised .
the prepaid phones are thrown away .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leader in the niche .
&quot; small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience , the staff and financial resources to protect business secrets effectively against unauthorized access , &quot; the bat warns in a report .
the us has its own firms warn of economic espionage by other countries .
according to the washington post were classified us national intelligence estimate in february , france , russia and israel behind china on two of the countries in the procurement of economic data from the hackings .
a board member of a german blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bernard squarcini , former head of the french domestic intelligence dcrl , this month was quoted in an interview with the following words : &quot; the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they work together in the fight against terror , spy on their allies . &quot;
when the horse experts in droves in cardiff met to hammer out to select the horse of the year , they knew that a rat race .
but no one was prepared for the three-year-old fenton kirkland .
the knirps , who is not even in kindergarten , and only a few months ago , made his first steps , and his shetland pony toffee trotted only loosely through the three rounds and got the first prize – with 30 adult opponents .
the inseparable pair , both the same size , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style at the annual competition , which is organized by the sunnybank equestrian centre in rudry near cardiff .
when he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee with the ring .
fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which would be far beyond his age .
and toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality .
fenton had toffee last march as a gift for his third birthday and practiced every day with the shetland pony .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : &quot; fenton and toffee are a great team . &quot;
they had to compete against the entire field of competitors and went with gold trophy and rosette .
it was only the second time that he took part in a competition with toffee , and we were all excited when he won .
perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .
the little boy from the village of nantyglo near ebbw vale , south wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt , sharon howells , who horses for over ten years .
howells said : &quot; the whole audience was as electrifying and all have inspired him and applause . &quot;
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena , and although he looked so tiny that he has done a fantastic job .
fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens , which he cares .
as it is , it won &apos;t be long until it is on the &quot; horse of the year &quot; show – and i am sure he will do well .
a spokesman for the annual horse said : &quot; fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . &quot;
together they are a great team .
the jury considered fenton and toffee according to how well they had beaten and vorführring .
they pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leaders – and fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that fentons sweet clothing has played its part that really fit perfectly with the occasion .

rescue package of 325 million australian dollars for tasman stadsschouwburg health care
the australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million australian dollars for the tasmanian health care to ensure that the government cannot waste federal state money .
federal health minister tanya plibersek has announced that the commonwealth will take &quot; immediate action &quot; to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints .
the funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the tasman independent mps andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government , &quot; said plibersek today .
the 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for election .
through further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey star , residues are to be eliminated .
in addition , there is money for clinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare for inpatient stays , specialist training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments reflect the ideas that have affected hospital staff said that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , &quot; said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tasman government duty .
the federal government should maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the commonwealth , and the monthly report on how the extra money has been spent .
a three-member commission will be established and is intended to ensure that the federal state of health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today that the 325 million dollars would be of little use if &quot; they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable path . &quot;
nevertheless , he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid , which he first against the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i am confident that the federal aid will be a major contribution to the public health system of the federal state from the list of concerns , &quot; said wilkie .
according to the government of the federal state , these services are election largely offset the recent cuts .
but the health spokesman for the opposition at federal level , peter dutton , believes that today &apos;s announcement is only a &quot; plaster solution . &quot;
&quot; we are in today &apos;s situation , because the labor state government $ 430 million deducted from the health system , &quot; he said to abc tv .
it is unacceptable that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the commonwealth 300 million and then pretend that the good news .
dutton called plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

proverbs come from the bible
40 women visited the last women breakfast this year in the protestant church bisingen .
theme of the day in the town hall were &quot; proverbs &quot; from the bible &quot; and &quot; phrases from the middle ages .
zita köhler , the chairman of the parish extend went after breakfast in a lecture to the biblical proverbs .
&quot; proverbs contain life wisdom , rules or warnings , &quot; she said .
it compared several proverbs with relevant bible and explained the meaning .
she called sayings like : wood eye is vigilant as to the fact that keep an eye on someone his own , there is the lord in sleep , wash his hands .
several times the speaker also advise their listeners , saying that it was .
the phrases from the middle ages , the churches councillor christel stretcher : all good things come in threes , blue , something verhauen .
she said meaning and origin of phrases , which she called &quot; bridges to the past . &quot;
finally , a raffle .
the prices were covered on a table and were humorous , before they were handed over to the winners .
among the visitors to the breakfast round interfered mayor candidate novel waizenegger .
you could call it the dostoyevsky in the united states .
philip k. dick was a gottsucher , a meta-physicist , his novels and stories have something serial .
amazingly the kinship abroad : the sharp eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as m. fyodor dostoevsky , with its massive oeuvre as ergründer and apologist for the russian soul , read philip k. dick as american prophet , which is quite a bit in his own country .
some titles are published in the publishing house , certainly one of the haffmans-cassette with 118 stories sells zweitausendeins .
dick explains america - the realm of the stunning technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security madness and the belief to be chosen .
dick had god &apos;s experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has figured early on that the computers are divinitäten .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine , the creator of his creation .
this is the &apos; blade runner &apos; problem .
the killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have inspired film regiss exporters like ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
now this story is particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates back to 1956 , he exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunals .
it is the principle of &quot; pre-crime &quot; , &quot; pre-crime &quot; , which is now more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dicks world that ours is frightening mutants look to the future - and the police .
&quot; we collect individuals who have violated any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we catch them before they can commit a violent crime . &quot;
and : &quot; in our society , there is no serious criminals , we have a criminal warehouse full of pesudoverbrecher . &quot; read .
they assume that bad things happen , and prevent the criminal idea into practice .
dicks narrative acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the nsa eavesdropping .
anticipation of the attack : that is also obama &apos;s drones philosophy and practice .
but dicks story is not over yet .
the police chief complained that there is no separation of powers , the military controls the everyday - and what is left of the state .
the monitors will be monitored and transferred to a future crime .
the system is .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it invents its own conditions .
mistakes and is not only victims , but builds upon it .
the system creates the danger that it opposed .
philip k. dick read is , again , to get closer to the truth .
blocked court decision to stop-and-frisk directive of nypd
a federal court of appeal in the united states blocked on thursday the formation of a judge , the changes to the stop-and-frisk program ( &quot; stop and search &quot; ) of the new york police department , and the judge absolving them of the case .
the 2 us appeal court stated that the decisions of judge shira scheindlin would be suspended until decided on an appeal of the city .
the judge had ruled in august , the city was in breach of the constitution with the way in which the programme will be implemented for the stopping and questioning of people .
the city appealed against their assessment and the remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body that should support the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme .
the appeal court heard on tuesday &apos;s arguments on the requested suspension .
the nomination report stated that the judge had to be discharged from the case because she had breached the code of conduct for us judge , is that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements , in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were inappropriately targeted black and latin american men with the stop-and-frisk program .
it has appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms in directives , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot program with the body cameras in districts , where most of the checks were carried out .
in august , the city of new york , ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were dismissed after an inspection by the police .
one of the appeal of the city is scheduled for 14 march 2014 .
the stop-and-frisk-tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates .
there are checks of this kind for decades in various forms , but the number of recorded controls rose during the term of the partyless mayor michael bloomberg to an all-time high of 684330 in 2011 , most of them black and latin american men .
in 2004 , was submitted by four men , all minorities , lawsuit , which developed into a class action .
supporters of changes to the stop-and-frisk program of the nypd say the changes will stop unfair practices and create a trust worthier and more effective police and influence the way in which the rules of other police chiefs .
opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not the crime ; the money is being wasted and would not solve the wider problem of police , after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure .
the judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional , but only the nature of the implementation of controls by the nypd reformiere .
anger over sentence for bombers in bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bomb attack in bali , reacted angrily at the verdict on the last of the instigator , who was brought to court , as umar patek should be summarily executed in their opinion .
patek , who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in southeast asia in flight , was yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years .
with criminal suspension , he could be released after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 australians , and many more were injured .
a guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorism-related charges , including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
the prosecution had demanded a life sentence , even though they can apply for the man who , because of his reputation as meisterlicher bomb builders as &quot; demolition man , &quot; the death penalty .
the decision was painful memories in june corteen , a mother from perth , the 39-year-old twin daughters jane and jenny in the devastation caused by patek and his mitverschwörern almost ten years ago .
fighting back tears , she said patek was to be sentenced to death .
i really think that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; we should put him in front of a erschießungs command , &quot; said corteen to aap .
i have to live with that every day that i will receive no further grandchildren and i will never see my daughters .
the sari club was razed to the ground , on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 11.00 p.m. , a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck was parked in front of the nightclub .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier to explode a suicide bombers a backpack filled with explosives .
he fell after the attack a month into a coma and died &quot; three times , while he hung on a lebenserhaltungssystem .
hughes said that patek was deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell jemaah islamiah , amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra , who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago .
really , this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else .
let him alive – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .
to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers , who was in court .
he cheated nearly a decade of arrest , but was finally picked up in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces nearly four months later killed the former al-qaeda chief osama bin laden .
during the negotiation of an fbi agent said that intelligence reports had provided to point out that patek was in pakistan to meet bin laden , with the aim to rebuild the connection between the southeast asian terrorist groups and al-qaeda .
&quot; he did not , &quot; said corteen .
until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has inflicted on other people .
the verdict came before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year , with commemorations in bali and australia .
&quot; this year there will be many tears , &quot; said corteen .
patek can still appeal against his sentence .

profits at bombardier to decrease in numbers and supply contracts
the canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer bombardier inc. reported a 15 % drop in net profits on thursday after he was declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure .
bombardier could be based in montreal , published no flight test data for its new aircraft of the cseries and gave no new information on whether the aircraft under the ambitious timetable next september in commercial use .
on the jungfernflug of test aircraft followed one and a half months , so far , only three more starts , which begs the question of whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .
the results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , an analyst at national bank financial , on thursday lowered its rating of &quot; outperform &quot; to &quot; sector perform &quot; in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters has a limited potential rate .
&quot; although weaker delivery figures were largely expected on aircraft , but the margins in the development of trans-sports field , we are clearly disappointed , &quot; said doerksen in a customer .
we believe that new orders for the bombardier cseries , if the test program is proceeding on the plane .
if no new orders will be announced in the coming months , we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of cseries can catapult the company into the lower market segment , which is currently dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was introduced in march , the public and flew for the first time after months of delays in september .
but so far , binding orders for the cseries with 177 moderate , as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new düsenverkehrsflugzeugs is correct .
currently , there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
board chairman pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets .
the company &apos;s management assured on thursday , in addition to analysts and the media , the program is in the schedule .
&quot; the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than we expected , &quot; said beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft had been ground tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is planning differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period , what we have done .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said by company .
however , analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the jungfernflug the first customer is an aircraft of the cseries .
bombardier said , check the planning for the commissioning ( eis ) and will update them in the next few months .
&quot; the slow progress of the test flight , even if they are obviously bombardiers internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; said doerksen .
in the third quarter coincided with the end on 30 september bombardiers net profits to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share in the previous year .
the adjusted earnings per share is 9 cents unchanged .
sales slipped slightly and fell from 4.2 % to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 billion dollars , thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft on 26 .
the contract was the aerospace division was 32.9 billion on september 30 dollars and was unchanged compared to 31 december .
&quot; in the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our targets , but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing , &quot; said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , announced that the turnover has increased in this division by nearly 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars .
the contract was in the transport sector , on september 30 , $ 32.6 billion and was slightly increased compared to 31 december .
the profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems with some large contracts .
according to the company &apos;s leadership , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .
in afternoon trading on thursday , the bombardier shares at 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars , after it was announced that the google cfo patrick pichette will switch to the board .
brazil &apos;s embraer sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers closest rival , reported on thursday a 10 % drop in quarterly profit .
rules on electronic devices on planes will remain in force for now in australia
australian airline passengers must continue to switch tablets and smartphones for takeoff and landing , despite efforts in the us to relax the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) allows u.s. airlines to change their targets so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight read e-books , videos , or play , provided they are in the &quot; flight mode . &quot;
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed , but there are many people angry that they can &apos;t read at the launch and landing their e-books .
australian companies are watching the decision to implement the us airlines oodles of work , but no immediate plans to change their rules .
the air traffic control authority casa also declared that they will look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in australia still apply .

scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which leaves the tail of a dog with his mood .
previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail to the right wedelten ( from the perspective of the dog ) , while it was the left-hand side in nervous dogs .
but now scientists say that other dogs can these subtle differences and respond to it .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the university of trento , said : &quot; in humans is well known that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli , positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we have tried to look at this in other species .
he also noted that in dogs , just as in humans , the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .
to learn more about how dogs on the lateral tail leaves react to their fellows , the researchers monitored the animals , while other dogs these films .
they measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the tail in two moves in the opposite direction
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have shown the dogs films with dogs , either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
if the animals looked like a dog &apos;s tail otherwise free expression , moved to the right ( ) has seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog , they remained completely relaxed .
but it was mainly the tail slope to the left ( from perspective of the dog wag ) , their heart rate rose and they saw restless .
according to professor vallortigara communicate the dogs not deliberately by these movements .
rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience that movements they should worry and when not .
he said : &quot; if you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is linked with friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the university of bristol explained that this was not the first study , which was investigated , both left and right is important for dogs .
last year there was a team from the university of lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left , when they see an aggressive dog , and to the right , if it is a happy dog .
in another research work at the university of victoria in canada : &quot; dogs tend to go to a robot dog , if his &apos; tail wag &apos; on the left and the right not to be restless – just the opposite , as in the italian study . &quot;
according to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies , the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he said .
&quot; although there is considerable evidence of many different types of mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes , but many of the details have yet to be determined , and dogs are no exception , &quot; says bradshaw .
since their behavior but simply put , it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail , sometimes in one , sometimes moving in the opposite direction .

in a pawn shop in the shopping centre in singapore bendemeer trades janani amirthalinga a golden armreif , a ring and a pair of earrings , in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters .
&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house , because all my money is , &quot; says amirthalinga .
although they earn every month , 3000 singapore dollars ( about 1730 euros ) as administrative assistant and her husband is working , the monthly family income , she explained .
indeed , the demand in parts of south-east asia – where household debt is growing – so large that valuemax , where it has its own exchange , this week became the third pawn shop that is listed on the singapore stock exchange .
the verpfänden of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money – 1300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – but also almost as cheaply as an unsecured bank loans .
typically , demand deposit houses in singapore a year effective interest rate of 17 percent , which is barely above the 15.4 percent , which requires the united overseas bank , a local lender , with a branch in the same shopping center .
but mortgage houses offer the advantage that no review of the credit or income evidence is required , which is why loans are faster than at banks .
why are millions of people in the region to mortgage houses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and growing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose monetary policy in developed economy , families with lower- and middle-income mortgage houses on in order to offset the difference in stotternder economy .
this week , the rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing household debt , mainly by rising mortgages , as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand and singapore have the highest household debt in asia relative to gdp according to the agency .
malaysia , with 80 % of gdp at the top of the list , an increase of 60 percent in 2008 .
people economists also worry about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which has come out this week just from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand .
&quot; in the end , this means that , in the face of rising costs , the people in the middle to lower end ( of the income scale ) will try to supplement their income , wherever possible , &quot; said song seng wun , economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards pledging personal items , because the people have the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family .
in singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawn shops in the city state .
people say : &quot; the price of gold looks good , let us pledge grandma &apos;s gold chain and bring back next month . &quot;
the largest thai pfandhausbetreiber , easy money , has seen a 20 % increase in customers in its stores in recent months .
the growth in the mortgage business is so strong that valuemax , operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 further expansion in singapore , not only in the neighboring malaysia – – where the company operates four houses , but also outside asia , yeah lee ching , business leader of valuemax .
the company financed with 60 percent of the singapore 66 million dollars this week with the ipo in singapore .
while some lenders are due to high interest rates in the crossfire , yeah explains that deposit houses not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders , but not directly increased the debt .
&quot; customers finance items that they already have , and treat personal valuables does not increase the haushaltsverschulung , &quot; she explained .
the pfandleihgeschäft is increasingly socially accepted as a short-term secured funding .
also , not all people who use pawn shop in financial difficulties .
rich people come from singapore in the branches of valuemax to pledge gold bars and rolex watches , for which they received up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
to our clients come from every social class .
&quot; this includes wealthy that need to borrow in the short term for a business or an investment , or small businesses , the bottlenecks in the cash flow , &quot; says yeah .

rangnick-bashing for schiris : no swallows mane king
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high form of federal league tables leader red bull salzburg is also disappointed with the sports director of &quot; cops &quot; by implementing the judges .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and alan are pushed into the category of swallows kings , &quot; he took the two offensivwirbler on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
recent occasion for rangnicks criticism was yellow for mane at 3-0 against grödig last sunday , in which the senegalese was an alleged acting fatal - but it was not , as the tv images showed .
&quot; a wrong decision , &quot; said rangnick , implementing harkam judges described as &quot; completely overwhelmed . &quot;
harkam would also have &quot; its part &quot; to the escalation between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the game .
his german lands man he defended resolutely : &quot; because i would behave in every situation as roger schmidt . &quot;
schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after skirmishes with hütter .
i do not know why .
&quot; because i am the one who was insulted , &quot; said the 46-year-old .
given the success run was rangnick but praise anthem .
&quot; there are only two words : &quot; well , he noted .
there is not much .
above all , the way the team plays is impressive .
this should continue .
there will be little squad changes during the winter transfer period .
there is no great reason to change anything .
&quot; except for a player with the desire that he wants to leave the club , &quot; said rangnick .
the british government has announced a study that will increase the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd proposes to achieve with the start of phase 1 in the year 2026 high-speed links between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister baroness kramer said , &quot; the project will bring britain closer together . &quot;
the scottish transport minister keith brown said that he was delighted to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after the completion of phase 2 , there will be links to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between london and the north of england of £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , hs2 ltd has commissioned to look for other routes capacity and journey time improvements in northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less end of glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : &quot; our goal for hs2 is a truly national network that britain and its cities closer together . &quot;
we will go ahead with hs2 , because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , thanks to hs2 .
the scottish state secretary alistair carmichael commented : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland . &quot;
on behalf of the scottish government called keith brown carmichael to &quot; unequivocally &quot; for the scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
brown said : &quot; the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , but also provides the economic power of scotland an argument for high-speed rail links across the uk . &quot;
that is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , the benefits for all , and complements the glasgow-edinburgh link that the scottish government is already planning .
i am looking forward to examine the investigation report with the british ministers next year and to decide on the next steps together .
with future prospects
actually , waltraud ries lives .
their house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with greenery , an old trees , nice neighbours , and not too much traffic .
in the city , there are only a few minutes by public transport .
&quot; i hope they are not afraid of spiders ? &quot; asks waltraud ries and points to a big spider at the door .
i am looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time .
but you know how difficult it is in stuttgart .
the reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern , at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment , she explained .
moreover , since a meniscus tears operation , the mittfünfzigerin have experienced what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor .
recently published a book of her on &apos; glücklich live in old age - which living form is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos; our apartment is the best example of what is not in old age , &apos; she begins to tell .
when she moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment , it was just a beautiful apartment located in the green .
today , in his mid-fifties waltraud ries thinks differently about it .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who could deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age .
most of it , as long as possible .
they are old , only the other &apos; , says schmunzelnd .
only when the suffering is great pressure , you are thinking .
&apos; then it may be too late , &quot; ries .
in her book , the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age .
&apos; what residential form but one chooses , is always an individual decision , &quot; she explained .
the leading solution exists not for the age .
even those who can afford the altersruhesitz in tuscany or brittany , should always consider that he could be ill .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the country &apos;s language vereinsame in the dolce vita , &quot; the specialist book author aussiedlungs willing to consider .
among their models are classic models of care , alternative forms of housing , or the pensioners often quoted-wg .
at the age of each has his tics and quirks
&apos; for me , it would be a residential community , but nothing , &apos; she says with a wink .
certainly not as a student-wg with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos; in the age you just need his withdrawal rooms &apos; , so ries .
a senior residential community can still work , the author does not want to exclude .
it must then work differently than in the classical student wg .
and sometimes you want to simply his rest , &quot; she believes .
with this view , it is not , at least in the country &apos;s capital alone .
&apos; the most old people in stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home , is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the country &apos;s capital .
the department advises people around the topic of &apos; ageing &apos; .
that is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions , only to be able to stay in that environment , that is the experience of the stiftung warentest .
there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free .
ries recommends all dealing with the age of just remodeling their house or apartment , once thoroughly and not just the best craftsmen .
today , there is also the age fair reconstruction specialists .
even in the rental apartment is one or the other , and if it is only the toilettensitzerhöhung , clarifies the interior designer .
but not always the existing apartment can transform age and thus accessible , even if it is so beautiful .
this experience has had to make waltraud ries .
although we could install a stair lift inside the apartment , but the road paved with stairs to the street would be a far greater obstacle .
it will continue until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .
before the move her dread more than before the spider on her front door .

cocaine addict lawyer , drug boss warned police investigation must be in prison
basharat ditta , 42 , gave further information on underworld size neil scarborough
the lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
he was sentenced to three years in prison by the liverpool crown court
a well-known criminal defense lawyers , a drug baron warned of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , provided underworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction .
the lawyer of kriminalisten as &quot; first class &quot; vaunted , nicknamed &quot; bash &quot; was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police had monitored scarborough , which he had represented in a previous drug trial .
officials watched as scarborough ( 32 ) , three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , ablieferte , while this was the lawyer chamber with colleagues during a meal .
the investigation revealed that ditta regularly consumed class a drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west york .
they , together with 32 other people were later arrested after the police in a series of raids of heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200000 in cash ensured .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals , because he feared that his drug addiction can be known .
today , ditta , who works for the firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , at liverpool crown court after three weeks of two counts of obstruction of justice , found guilty and sentenced .
he admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey .
the lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations of scarborough found that this was in february 2011 in regular telephone contact with ditta .
two officials of the investigation followed the suspects and saw how he went to dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , called scarborough regularly with ditta , who was at the dinner in the football stadium of blackburn rovers at ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , the drugs , and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .
in court , it became known that ditta was a &quot; regular &quot; consumers of cocaine after tests of class a drugs had been discovered in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested , but denied to take cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer , because it was his client , and claimed that their discussion &apos; ed &quot; lawyer secret . &quot;
during his arrest ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample .
the police interrogation , he admitted , he both under his home address and an office at the work place and clients would call him at home because of legal issues .
in court , it became known that he has important players in the drug trade , some of which he had previously called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about it .
state lawyer anne whyte said : &quot; a criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law . &quot;
ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he has too much with certain clients .
the relationship is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs .
some of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .
but that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was the police investigation as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr ditta brought to his profession in disrepute .
he was certain clients , especially scarborough , and he allowed his independence has been compromised .
ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed : &quot; if i were a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and wanted to pass on information to scarborough , then i would not wait 15 hours , but to do so immediately . &quot;
but after hearing the superintendent lee halstead said by the police in lancashire : &quot; mr ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public eye .
ditta has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession .
the serious and organised crime unit of lancashire led the investigations against ditta , which led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we will find you and bring you to justice .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison , after the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade was found guilty .
thirty-five more involved in the drugs &apos; people were sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website published ditta an area with questions and answers about where he , his dream job , as a lawyer to represent clients in the cell death in america , his ultimate dinner guest was mohammed ali and inequality is the motivation for his work .
until now , the police inspectorate kempten can look back on a quiet halloween night .
the officials were only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against building facades .
because the homeowners realized it in time and removed the eggs , will be no material damage .
furthermore , were also some sylvester böller detonated in the city , but there is no material damage .
a resident in the bishop-freundorfer path reported that his car with klopapier wrapped and his radzierblenden were stolen .
until the arrival of the police , the man has his radzierblenden , however , all found in the immediate vicinity , which is why the police had no further action .

council takes track facilities targeted
the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; lavishly rebuilt to increase traffic safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
schiltach has to 220000 euros .
deutsche bahn wants to improve in the coming year the kinzigtal-rail route .
especially to enhance safety at level crossings are regularly - it is far to collisions of trains with other vehicles .
the communities into , they need to be involved with one third of the costs , the rest are divided and federal .
schiltachs city architect roland grießhaber explained the specifics of bahübergangs &quot; hirschen . &quot;
the city plans to build the railway tracks a bulge in the west of the tunnel mouth .
there could also larger vehicles , such as those transporting logs , with oncoming traffic , without having to block the tracks .
grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could expand the subsequent road in due time , in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this has been controversial in the council , as some councils , the need for a proliferation of roads in doubt : thomas tilt with his statement , the mood of the critics to the point : &quot; we need to , because so few vehicles so much money ? &quot;
mayor thomas haas said : the railway crossing hirschen will be regularly used for langholztransporte .
even wood constrcution kuhbach &quot; partly transported via this route , because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the häberlesbrücke , because they could not turn on the main street .
in addition , the route serves as umleitungfür those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main street is blocked , haas argued .
since it was that kirchberg and schlossbergtunnel and should be rehabilitated , as is currently the case in wolfach , the railway crossing &quot; hirschen for a longer period of important traffic .
the councils agreed to examine the costs would cause the idea of broadening the road .
nevertheless , was approved by a majority of the reconstruction of the railway crossing , with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall will be built so that the city of the subsequent direction &quot; bahnhofstraße &quot; for encounters traffic increase to around 5.5 meters .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing in leather trautwein could lead to a completely different problem , which concerns the access to the &quot; geroltzhäuser path to increase substantially . &quot;
the administration had examined the renovation plans of the railway from the engineering office breinlinger , because they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltzhäuser route was still possible .
the investigation came to the conclusion that it is not inconceivable that the inclination of road conditions that could lead to longer picked vehicles .
responsibility for this , in turn , the city as straßenbaulastträgerin .
the renovation could therefore liability disputes .
since both the wood collection and were left in the current state of development , we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing , haas argued .
also , at this point , the risk of a collision of the train , with a good view of the transition of the vehicle is significantly lower than in the other train passes , because right in the mid-point , to which a connection .
even trains from the main railway station should be slowed down at this point that no threatening collision .
the majority of the reconstruction of this railway crossing refused to consent , as the city schiltach should suffer the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles &quot; , &quot; the councils , as the train after the completion of the construction work could withdraw from the responsibility .
as the panel considers the modifications to the railway crossings &quot; heubach &quot; and &quot; kuhbach , &quot; for the already kreuzungs agreements have been reached by train .

syria has destroyed the possibility for the production of chemical weapons , a monitoring group
syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gitftgasmunition , declared the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on thursday , while in the north of the country clashed near one of the locations where suspected toxic substances are stored .
also on thursday , a syrian activist group announced that more than 120000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war , nearly three years .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the deadline on
november 1 , the organization , based in the hague , damascus , in order to make all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons or &quot; inoperabel &quot; to poison gas , including all machines for mixing chemicals and the filling of ammunition .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable , which is aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in syria by mid-2014 .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
but damascus has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies .
according to estimates there are about 1000 tons of chemicals and weapons , including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas .
the announcement came at a time when , on thursday , fighting in the town of safira , the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites , such as the uk-based syrian observatory for human rights .
the activist group , which has a network of activists in syria , the number of deaths , said on thursday , 120296 people have died .
it is 61067 civilians , including 6365 children .
on the government side 29954 belonged to them by the army of president bashar assad , 18678 were pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .

on july 25 , the un estimated the number of deaths in the conflict since march 2011 to 100000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has forced some two million people to flee from the country .
assad &apos;s forces have been fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of whom have ties to al-qaeda groups .
the monitoring body said that there was thursday losses on both sides , but gave no details .
the battles underline the danger of the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a brutal civil war .
according to the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , the team is now convinced that all of syria important production and mixing / bunkering facilities and has witnessed its destruction . &quot;
that is why &quot; are currently planned no further inspection activities . &quot;
at the beginning of the week , the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and 21 of 23 of the specified sites visited by damascus .
because of security concerns , the visit of two facilities had not been possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc , the two sites have been abandoned , &quot; according to the syrian statement ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other &apos; facilities have been inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two institutions that have not been able to visit the opcw inspectors .
syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , the next month , must be approved by the executive committee of the opwc .
&quot; i salute the bravery and the courage of all of you in the fulfilment of the most challenging mission , which was ever carried out by this organisation , have shown , &quot; said ahmed uzumcu , the director-general of the monitoring organization in a commentary published by opcw .
fighting for three years now , the mainly sunni muslim rebels in the civil war against assad &apos;s government and its security forces , which includes many members of the alawites , a secession of shiite islam .
in terms of further developments , the head of the observation group , rami abdurrahman said that there was on wednesday , a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he said .
rbs suspended two currency traders
the royal bank of scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another sign that the world &apos;s official investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market exploded .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the world &apos;s largest financial market , the daily $ 5.3 trillion to the owner .
the two dealers would be the first rbs staff who have been suspended in the widening investigation of the scandal surrounding the libor interbank business .
the bank made no comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .
&quot; our investigations into this matter will continue and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities , &quot; said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , the situation suggests that the rbs the records of e-mails and instant messages , and were sent to a former trader , forwarded to the british supervisory authority , the financial conduct authority .
the dealer , richard usher , had left the rbs in 2010 and is now in its current position as a european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan beurlaubt .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , was suspended this week beurlaubt and matt gardiner , formerly a senior currency trader at barclays and ubs , was this week at standard chartered .
none of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing .
the instant message group of usher were bankers at barclays and citigroup , said the situation close to people .
this week , ubs announced that it had taken steps against some of its staff , after the swiss regulatory authority finma had declared that they will examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities around the world – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – currently deal with allegations that bankers have agreed on the currency market transactions .

the news of these investigations , the dealer in one area into turmoil , which belongs to one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because of low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid currency market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .
a leading dealers noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks means that &quot; one with very low ticket prices can have an impact on the market . &quot;
the news came out on the same day , when credit suisse announced that it had terminated this week , a distributor of london exchange traded funds offices , after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them .
&quot; we are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control , &quot; said credit suisse .
coulson , phone-hacking for checking a tips

state prosecutor andrew edis qc told the court at the old bailey , the news of the world in may 2005 have heard a false rumor that clarke had a relationship with his attractive &quot; special adviser &quot; hannah pawlby .
the newspaper commissioned the private investigator glenn mulcaire to hack voicemails pawlbys , and she pursued , but coulson called them and left messages , as the court was told .
&quot; according to the prosecutor &apos;s office is coulson , who is now editor of the notw , no one stands in front of the apartment by people hoping to catch them in flagrante delicto , but one that people are faced with a story to see their reaction , &quot; said edis .
he said that notw use three procedures to investigate citizen stories : phone-hacking , surveillance and confrontation .

early puberty : grow up faster
african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age , as studies show .
physical changes mean not directly puberty
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a cause of early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children &apos;s health and family issues .
a mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics paediatricians association this week in orlando , florida , said the paediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among american girls and a new standard .
&quot; i spend a lot of time to reassure parents – normally , this is not a sign that is rapidly entering puberty , &quot; explained kaplowitz .
obvious displays of development , such as growing breasts , shame and achselhaare and body odor , with girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( first menstrual period ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age at 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; if the development of breasts begins , it will still take at least two to three years to menarche , &quot; said kaplowitz , author of the book &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring . &quot;
time is the most accurate test , as puberty progresses .
it is controversial , as indeed is the beginning of puberty , but it is &quot; precocious &quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years .
in most cases , the process is slowed down or stalled – something that can closely monitor a pediatrician .
tests by a endikronologen displayed so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded for faster progress .
there are methods of treatment to delay an early menstruation and another consequence : the premature ageing of the bones , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body grew in adults .
the recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and emotional maturity .
psycho-social aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : &quot; the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavior problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age mates . &quot;
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their young daughters have the period .
&quot; they are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side , &quot; said kaplowitz .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls a woman whose daughter has received her ten days .
although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation , she was not emotionally prepared .
she was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her circle of friends .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food products , chemicals in the environment or the cause of sexual messages in the media .
young are similar to girls in puberty .
kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years , a link between body fat and entry into puberty .
other studies support that conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
in this country tend to be african-american and hispanic girls puberty rather than their white age .
there are various explanations for this .
globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , economic conditions on the climate to the genes .
another mystery : although the boys face and schambehaarung earlier grows , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
other doctors at the aap conference underscored the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of acne and pubic hair is even babies and toddlers .
&quot; we need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor , how they should speak with their child .
&quot; this may mean that you must sooner than expected , &quot; advised kaplowitz .
if we remain quiet , the child usually reacts well .
girls bloom early , need the insurance , the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than expected .

before the spot derby against schalke had mitgereiste bvb trailer with leuchtraketen for ugly scenes in the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund has severe consequences .
before the freitags game of football league league against vfb stuttgart responded the ultras first with silence .
it was a strange , almost ghostly acoustics , which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the federal league game between the german runner-up borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart in the signal iduna park .
to hear the guests are mostly fans with their chants .
the south stand , where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest bvb fans - are , first , exceptionally quiet : no chants , no battle cries .
the podium of the capo , otherwise coordinates the common spirit , remained vacant .
and the front of the gallery lonely blew a large flag with the inscription &quot; section of the stadium ban . &quot;
only as goalkeeper roman weidenfeller , as always , as the first bvb players entered the square , brandete short-lived jubilation .
when his fellow team followed , there were loud singing and floating scarves - but not everywhere .
in the 12 and 13 blocks of central south stand there .

the game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes kicked off .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke , the top of the dortmund ultras then received in his office - and it is believed watzkes words , this was the fanvertreter a rather ungemütlicher deadline .

otherwise , watzke , bvb will establish a sanction by the end of next week .
&quot; this is drastic , &quot; assured watzke .
it will be interesting to see how the reactions to the south stand .
what happens on the road with my e-mail ?
e-mail is actually an electronic letter .
it was implemented in the design of the internet service , e-mail , similar to the traditional post-technically the letter secret ?
in the design of the early internet services was the focus to make communication possible .
we did not pay attention to the basic technical protocols to create a solid foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence .
therefore , a traditional e-mail is more of an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; &quot; benn &quot; sends a message that computers are directly connected to the two ?
the e-mail program or the browser of anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a gmail account , it would be google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider , uses the benn .
on the route the mail can run on many other servers on the internet .
bennie can then call the content with their provider .
are traditional e-mails on their way through the network mitgelesen ?
most of the messages are read on several times by software robots .
the provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail brings a malicious program as an annex .
the receiver systems will also be a virus check .
also check the provider , whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail , wegsortiert is deleted , or at least in a spam folder .
the robots have yet another task ?
in systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information that google needs for placing of context-advertising .
if anna and benn communicate about their upcoming holiday travel via gmail , google may display links to holiday .
read also unknown people with e-mails ?
the likelihood that unauthorized persons hear an e-mail is extremely low .
in theory , but it is possible .
companies often administrators have the opportunity to mitzulesen electronic mail .
the pursuit of criminal authorities and secret services have legal avenues to intercept e-mails or to take note .
these are possible illegal ausspäh actions .
is it possible to protect e-mails against in reading ?
with an encryption after the openpgp standard e-mail can be effective against mitlesen encrypted .
it is also possible with high technical effort to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that not even can be easily detected , who communicates with whom .
how important are yahoo and google in the e-mail market in germany ?
in the play mainly used private mailboxes , yahoo and google , according to a study of convios consulting from august 2013 .
while the shares of yahoo mail had fallen , gmail was google .
germany &apos;s largest country church has launched a campaign to promote the profession of the pastor .
background is a possible shortage of priests : the evangelical-lutheran church country hanover expects that the number of currently around 1800 pastor and pastors to current situation will halve by 2030 .
the profession is very attractive to young people of today and offer good future prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the protestant press service .
it is attractive to be able to determine the work and day .
with burfien instructed the country &apos;s church , for the first time , a pastor at a place to inspire young people for the study of theology .
currently choose fewer and fewer young people after graduating to study theology .
burfien leads the world in the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , loud . &quot;
it is marked by great freedom and diversity of the profession .
i am mr my calendar and my priorities , where it is important to me .
pastors as pastors could be very close to the people .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well .
certainly will be paying more in the free economy , but theologians have a secure employer .
this brings the young people of today , it is not just a career , but a meaningful work .
according to the country &apos;s church , which includes three-quarters of lower saxony , currently around 60 pastors per year in retirement .
at the same time some 40 graduates of theology studies begin their vikariat .
in sparsely populated and peripheral regions such as the resin , the emsland or the wendland could in the future it will be difficult to fill posts .
among other things , burfien wants to hold study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the theology studies offer a broad education .
you can even be federal president .
hearing before the royal commission : two ymca staff before allegations against lord jonathan accused of sex offences
two ymca staff from new south wales ( nsw ) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers jonathan lord of caringbah , such as the royal commission for sexual abuse of children .
but the opening statement before the commission had declared the ymca , you had to do with never an incident of child sexual abuse &quot; in the organization . &quot;
business leader phillip hare was asked about a case where a ymca employee was charged with offences of child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the ymca caringbah hall was in 1991 because of the abuse he follow children .
hare said gail furness , a lawyer assistierenden commission that he had known of the first case , the second was not known .
he acknowledged that the opening statement of the ymca to the commission was also vague on the assertion that &quot; there have been external reviews of the ymca , in which the ymca was recognised as at the forefront of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission show that the ymca was informed that he has received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( educational department ) in august of this year .
hare , who started with 21 at the ymca , admitted that the line &quot; i failed to down &quot; in the recruitment of lord and not ensured that staff had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety .
lord had been convicted of sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of work for the ymca at the beginning of the year .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
but hare denied that the ymca had a cultural problem that prevented staff , lords to report offences in relation to the safety of children .
the employees said that they had observed violations , among other things , that lord was alone with children , she worked as a babysitter , they sit on his lap , said that he liked it , and children playing with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , whose leader was lord and had asked for a training on child protection , because she was worried about his behavior , said that the kinderdienstleiterin jacqui barnat , the lords in the ymca caringbah the chief was very intimidating , &quot; and most of the time was very remote . &quot;
the business leader said that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superiors .
instead , he said , but their friendship with lord their judgment impaired assets , which is why they had not reported it .
hare said that he had informed the board of the ymca nsw his view that the lesson to draw the organization from the jonathan lord incident &quot; , &quot; not reporting affects &quot; by staff , and the board voted for him .
hare said the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations had been made by the business leaders of the children &apos;s services of the ymca , liam whitley .
he said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented , but it was &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw was busy at the time , as jonathan lord between 2009 and 2011 , there was no safe for children , said professor stephen small bone of griffith university , an expert on child sexual abuse , the commission .
he explained that there had been &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , review , training , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing was postponed until december 20 .
tourism : descent to the romans
at around 120 metres below a sewage channel of cologne from the roman period .
anyone who visited cologne at the cathedral is not over .
about 157 meters above the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who see the two slender spires , knowing that there are also under the cathedral to discover a lot .
rainer schulze is an expert in cologne underworld .
meeting point for the tours is the service centre of cologne tourism directly at the cathedral .
the tour begins very unspectacular : &quot; we start in the garage , &quot; says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a fair city car , and that is why there was only by the remnants of the old city wall , which was not too great .
most users of the car park today therefore also rush past the roman ruins and their car .
but who is a closer look , discovered in a parking deck d2 separated by metal mesh rods .
to see about five metres high ruins of handtellergroßen stones .
&quot; there are remnants of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century a.d. , &quot; says schulze .
before it goes to the light of day , schulze leaves the participants on the upper level still take a look at a dark shaft , 15 metres deep .
this is the fountain of the old cathedral , which , unfortunately , is hardly noticed .
next station of this walk is the pretorian , and here the participants climb back down into the depths .
we are seeing here is the office of the once-powerful man north of the alps , the prätors ccaa .
what does ccaa , would like to know a visitor .
&quot; the acronym stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which means in plain english as much as &quot; city of roman law and the city of agrippinenser , founded under emperor claudius in the place of the altar for the emperor &quot; cult &quot; .
and the pretorian is the former proconsul palace , the power center of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the foyer of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman sewer , which is here to around 120 metres .
&quot; you can walk along a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima , if you want , &quot; schulze is encouraging for the guests .
a surprise schulze has yet .
after he has brought to the cashier the key , he leads the group into a 16-meter walk-shaft .
&quot; we are now in a mikvah , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he says .
the jewish community built its bath deep in the soil , in order to get to the groundwater , which was essential for the ritual washing .
to date , at the lower end of the mikvah , whose origins go back to the eighth century , different water levels by changing levels of the rhine .
the mikvah is part of an archaeological zone at the town hall square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .
through to completion , but will still take several years .

in addition , there is a training and test in february and the option to participate in desert races in north africa and the middle east in the defender challenge .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives scots the choice
a new day , a new horror story to independence .
this time , we are warned that an independent scotland was required to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this provides the cue for stories about passport checks in berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the hadrianswalls .
in fact , in the strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of europe , but this was – according to expectations – no role in the headlines .
no one has mentioned that the eu member states often bent strict rules when it is convenient for them .
as scotland currently does not belong to the schengen area , would be the continued disregard for brussels , only a small concession in exchange for what you really want from the scots .
so not really a story .
and one that has already happened in the years that it already resembles a fossil , the first time i heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; duck at least 40 years .
this is an interesting interes lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .
why should we expect from an independent scotland that dances to the tune of europe ?
why the london yoke against the trade from brussels , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great plan for the unification of europe , adopted after the war is faltering .
with the euro crisis , the european project is officially dead .
throughout the eu , parties are gaining ground , hostile to the eu or the euro as a common currency would throw overboard .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party , alternative for germany , founded this year – nearly five million votes in the bundestags election in september to acquire and distribute effectively the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) from the bundestag .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis is a turning point .
because of the strict austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket , forced into the national economy by adhering to the single currency , many people believe that the european project has gone too far .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits – that was the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has its members pinned down on exchange rates , which are beneficial for german exporters , and the german politicians would like .
without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by berlin .
behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper european productivity problem .
as a result of the imposed by brussels &apos; green &apos; energy policies – a code for subsidizing french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers – the european industry compared with the united states twice for electricity and four times for gas .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in grange mouth .
all of the world lohnfestschreibungen protect european petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap us shale gas .
as a result of a revolt , especially in france , the former cheerleader for the eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle that germany was kept in check and paris on an equal footing with washington .
however , berlin , paris does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and europe has imposed its own economic policy , the ailing french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , eu anti-national front has just won a key by-election , and thus the ruling socialists in third place .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the british labour party that it cannot assume that a split in the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left .
what makes le pen with their newly gained popularity among the white french working class ?
she would like to use the eu elections next year to forge an anti-eu , anti-eu currency bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties do well in these elections – and it is very possible – it could for the first time such a block dominate the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the eu and the single currency will come together to the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it is something like the &quot; europe &quot; ( sovereign nations ) , the favored general de gaulle .
germany and some of its satellite economies may keep the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect that britain distanced himself from the project in the hope to curry favour with the us .
however , washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain will stand alone in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to be a region ( ultimately little england ) .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels to say what they can hinstecken where .
i suspect that scotland could go very well in a looser european network , if we keep our own currency .
cooperation with other countries , similar thinking is not a federal europe of the nations group easier .
otherwise , we should consider norway and retain our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and won ) made cuts , which had the labour chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling and the subsequent tory-lib dem coalition .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to decide now for independence , only to be imposed from berlin and brussels austerity .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices on planes ( but no phone conversations )
passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices to read , work , games , music , and use the prestige of films , but not with the mobile phone , the new guidelines , which were issued on thursday by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in the us .
but passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented , would depend on the respective airline , said faa employees michael huerta at a press conference .
the airlines , the faa must prove that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices , according to the new rules .
the faa said that she had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
among these airlines were delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the faa announced in a statement .
currently , passengers must switch smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .
they should start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers , and the captain gives the green light .
when entering the landing , the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again , before the plane landed .
under the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the devices at launch , landing on the tarmac , the faa said .
most new transport aircraft and other pilots with the use of wi-fi in altitudes , should meet the criteria .
laura glading , president of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new system is implemented – and we are working closely with the airline , both sides will benefit from this , &quot; said glading .
we are frankly tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this issue .
but continued banned internet connections for surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres , the agency explained .
passengers are urged to make smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so there is still no &quot; words with friends , &quot; the scrabble like online game played by the actor alec baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone , when he had to leave Öffentlichkeits effectively an american airlines jet because he refused to shut down the device , while the plane was parked on the flight .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored as a verletzungs risk if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned .
the regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not with the faa .
faa lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
last month , said mark rosenker of the traffic safety agency national transportation safety board , safety expert for national traffic issues at cbs news , mobile phones are still regarded as a risk .
&quot; mobile is really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruptions to navigation equipment , but because we know from the fcc that transmission from the air also disrupt transmission towers , &quot; said rosenker .
an advisory committee of the industry , which was launched by the faa to investigate this matter , recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years has increased the pressure on the faa to loosen restrictions on the use .
critics such as democratic senator claire mccas kill from missouri argue that there is no valid security reasons for the ban .
the restrictions have also become increasingly difficult because the use of the devices is omnipresent .
in some studies , up to one third of the passengers forget about the closure of the device or ignored .
the faa began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers , after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communications equipment were of passengers bears fm radios , which at the time of the latest technology trend .
new aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the faa that they have no electronic interference .
airlines offer passengers for several years , wi-fi , if the altitude is reached .
the pilots adapted to wi-fi systems are also less susceptible to interference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be eligible for the increased use of electronic devices , according to the new guidelines , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices in general , much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-reader example , only minimal radiation , if you umblättert .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission of values .
the advocates of an easing of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is amazon.com .
in 2011 , an employee of passenger aircraft kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks in the use of equipment .
douglas kidd from the national association of airline passengers association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption by the device is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said that there are only scattered reports of pilots who spoke for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
the committee recommended the faa to allow pilots in landing instruments under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the equipment by the passengers .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes , describing it as a sensible adjustment for travellers who today would be extensively equipped with technology .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with the security , &quot; said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .

this is &quot; hq 100a climate &quot; in expert circles .
the floods which have caused significant damage in 2009 gechingen corresponded to a 1000-year flood .
&quot; there is not an absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , &quot; says häußler .
in order to achieve the protection hq 100a climate , must be invested in gechingen around four million euros , and the municipality can count on country grants amounting to around 70 percent .
but häußler pointed out that the promotion only if an overall concept will be implemented .
the town is dependent on the participation of the citizens .
an elaborate planning and approval process must be completed .
at best , 2016 could be started with the implementation .
among other things , the concept of protection , which has already been presented last week in the local council ( reported ) local measures in the tributary of the river irm from the stammheimer valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns .
among other things , has been called into question , why not more dams and rückhaltebecken are planned for the protection of the site .
gregor kühn , planners of the commissioned engineering firms forest and corbe from hill , who presented the concept , stressed that it needs all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal .
moreover , it is to find the most economical solution , joachim forest of forest and corbe .
there was resentment in countries bordering the altorts , even in normal storm rains suffer an overload of the canal network .
the problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .
however , häußler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems other than for flood protection , and this should not be mixed .
the community is committed to the canal network could be construed so that two- to three-year rain events .
the sewers larger dimensions would devour millions .
the newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe .
one that invites you to linger and re- .
one thing that would make the name of the program .
as déjà vu is according to a psychological phenomenon , which leads to the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation .
in the case of the visit of the cafés in opschlag in kleve district town within sight of the rhine-waal university must not remain pure déjà vu feeling .
after all , the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the target : a real stay not only intellectually , but always hand repeatedly .
because it is fun and it is simply beautiful .
a look into the inner life of the opschlag 8 gives the viewer to a good feeling .
the ultra-modern , but not cool cafe atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .
here , the team with the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel buettner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or a cocktail .
there are delicious cakes or individually fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , even before the opening of the charming cafés in opschlag as restaurateurs made a name : in kranenburg attributed the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
the move to kleve in opschlag hope the likable cafe-lovers more audience .
not least by the university .
&quot; we do not have a specific target group , &quot; said daniel buettner .
instead , the two want to address young students as well as seniors and all age categories .
speaking of coffee lovers .
the friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee .
the fragrant hot brew itself in different variations .
expressofan
daniel buettner is rather the expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt cappuccino-drinking .
&quot; a baguette - that is my thing , &quot; she tells the nrz .
two events there was already in the bright cafe .
rather , one .
because the port was more out there - the café déjà vu benefited from it .
but there was also the ringelnatzabend .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny , &quot; the two 33-year-olds .
but not everyone &apos;s thing .
perhaps daniel buettner is not a real fan of event evenings : &quot; you can do it is not all right . &quot;
and with an event , i am only ever , which is also interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception rather than with us .
&quot; we want to disrupt the normal operation of as little as possible . &quot;
should read : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings of the opschlag in kleve .
the road that is increasingly becoming a mile gastronomy .
to the delight of many klever , guests from near and far , and the students who discover the gastro mile and the café déjà vu .

jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a dispute over the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights , which set the tone for a bitter clash at the dubai airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the seat width , the passengers will be offered on long flights in economy class – not always those that most airlines , but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from airbus sas and boeing co .
airbus this week called for an industry standard , which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in economy class , but the us erzrivale boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines .
the controversy comes at a time when the aircraft are competing to sell even bigger versions of its twin-engine long-range aircraft , and at the event from 17 to 21 november expect record orders .
as the rear of the aircraft , in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the specified economic results , which is to deliver the new &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; design .
boeing claims its modernized &quot; 777x &quot; take 406 people in seats in economy class , which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line .
airbus says that the competing version of the a350 befördere 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class , and there are nine per line .
aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press .
now , airbus appealed before the dubai airshow , where the 777x with over 100 orders is expected to make the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company has an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture in which squeezed three people sitting in a restaurant , and the title : &quot; would you accept that ? &quot;
&quot; boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft , &quot; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
in light of changed eating habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 , the modern long-distance travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years increased by ten percent , the data from the us department of health .
the taillenumfang of the male average american is in the 21 century , according to us health statistics 100.8 cm .
airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly getauften &quot; jet set &quot; was narrow .
it was , airbus , conducted research that showed that an extra inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat raises the sleep quality by 53 percent .
boeing denies the figures from airbus to the seat and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings .
the company also said , according to studies , the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width .
&quot; it really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed , &quot; explains the flugkabinenexperte kent craver of boeing .
they do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , there is more freedom elbows , but for manufacturers , it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales .
behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the export performance of the us or europe .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .
both airbus and boeing claim 20 percent more efficient per seat than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater boeing 77-300er in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs .
boeing &apos;s statements on the results partly depend on the 777x with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products , &quot; says kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort in european airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say , full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment , which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares .
&quot; eighteen inch seat width would be great for the passengers , but the reality is that from an economic face from the airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777 , &quot; says mary kirby , an expert on cabin furnishing , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines can choose .
the world travelers jet sellers even tape measure , for the creation of gherkins in the competition .
even if they advertise the comfort , but also offer all manufacturers jets with highly condensed form for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus offers a a350 with zehnsitzigen ranks , but has not yet been sold , according to its own statement .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and wide seats for some jets in the corridors .
without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle , but could distract from the wave of 777x-sales .
veganism is subordinate to the vegetarianism , according to dictionaries , differs from this , but in a very significant way .
while vegetarians are eating cream cake , ice cream or a strong edam , they provide are not on the menu of a veganers .
milk , cheese , eggs , in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan from all the consumption of animal products , including honey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but on closer inspection the vegan diet world through a remarkable provokers wealth .
&quot; brotaufstriche are very popular , &quot; said ute henkel mann , the owner of the house of reform , which holds a number of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also visited the store in the domgasse .
for 13 years , the native new zealanders live vegan , he finds in lampertheim ( almost ) everything that he needs to live . &quot; in 1997 , i asked my diet and became a vegetarian . &quot;
at the turn of the century was the next step and i became a vegan .
&quot; but the conviction was not only because of the diet , but because of the shoe choice , &quot; says proctor , art leather prefers plain leather .
he realized that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns .
it is primarily a vegan ethics .
&quot; i do not want to see animals must die for me , &quot; proctor speaks from the maxim of vegan , which covers the entire consumer behaviour .
instead of burgers , scrambled eggs or rubber bears hinterherzutrauern , vegans have quickly discovered new products , the enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proctor today , &quot; vegan is not a renunciation , no asceticism , but it is an asset . &quot; the assumption that the nutritional change the selection of dining options , proctor brings more to the power of habit .
and it is exactly these conditions could also have some well-intentioned attempt to fail .
&quot; the addictive is a crucial factor , which leaves many fast , as with smoking , &quot; proctor is a comparison .
and : &quot; certain tastes are not &quot; to the animal .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation , which make up the taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; the vegan .
bring to a barbecue example proctor , eggplant , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages .
he pays attention to a balanced , the colourful rich diet , once rich taste .
of course you want to have something between the teeth , it is legitimate .
&quot; it is to taste , but it is not only to reduce animal food , &quot; says proctor .
damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption that he had not suffered .
for me , the change has had a positive aspect .
i am no stranger to cholesterol and have an increased proportion of vitamins .
there are high-performance athletes who are exclusively vegan diet .
&quot; my blood values are , i am often check , &quot; mr. proctor .
especially against the lack of vitamin b12 , many vegansimus critics warn .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , rather than to graze on the pasture , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the kühlt calm , the vitamin b12 share is high , &quot; proctor .
for vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are in order , &quot; he explains .
distances proctor should not go for the food fund raising .
basic food resources are there , and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products .
everything i need , i think on the ground .
and i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is what is known for &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products . &quot;
anyway , the preparation veganer courts is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .
&quot; in the kitchen , there is much to discover , with a few small tips can be good , if not in part to achieve better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheesecake proctor could bring his in-laws .
family firm gives a new vegan .
this dynamic , when you cook , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise as diverse as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
he was , of course , but also scepticism .
you enjoy my food ?
&quot; i now feel bad because i drink milk ? &quot; - with questions of this kind must act as vegans with tact .
&quot; i do not reject people , yes , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor would not enclaves .
and a closer look at the everyday world appears to be not so vegan as suspected - and not the vegan so restricted in everyday life , as is commonly believed .
even fast food is allowed .
french fries are everywhere !
&quot; many dönerläden offer falafel , or a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proctor .
in a pizzeria is ordered to pasta , or a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slow it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago , vegan diet , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the new zealanders can locate a development : &quot; you must talk to the people , they point out . &quot;
&quot; if enough requests , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegane restaurants , such as the galley in mannheim or the café bird .
proctor is the wish that other restaurants have at least a vegan dish on the menu .
basically , vegan dishes are there for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , and in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; proctor says .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way , mostly from the outset , &quot; says proctor .
but the purchase veganer products can be rather difficult at the beginning .
especially if you learn to understand the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many obstacles and traps quickly .
not only have reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - personal content and their alternatives , &quot; explains the many content substances , the food but also be entombed cleaning agents .
&quot; gradually , it developed a scanner and knows it has to pay attention to the signs and logos , &quot; sometimes it is better to take small steps as or to stumble , &quot; proctor knows .
veganism , it is an important moral enough to raise awareness .
perhaps he is not quite that his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to take a critical look at their habits .
bavaria &apos;s basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
even the first defeat in the euro league could not detract from the basketballern bayern munich &apos;s huge optimism .
&quot; nobody can forbid us to believe that winning the last two years against the best team in europe , &quot; said bayern coach svetislav pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on thursday evening at the defender olympiakos piraeus .
we have sent the message : also exists in munich basketball !
the munich long very well in their first third appearance in the european king class , were sold at crucial moments , but simply not enough .
the first guests the artwork was a 15-point lag 13 minutes into a leadership before piraeus gave the game a turning point .
&quot; we have an incredible fight back against the euro twice-champions league , but then again leichts subtle mistakes , &quot; said bayern professional yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .

new anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking mess
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction .
before tests on humans will be needed more tests , which can still take several years , but professor ronald crystal from weill cornell medical college in new york , said that the first results are good .
&quot; we are very message that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all methods available on the market , but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , &quot; says cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , causing a smoking no nicotine-high .
in experiments , vaccinated mice who were given nicotine in their normal activity level .
mice without vaccination against it had taken a &quot; break &quot; , the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine reaches the brain .
the experiments are described in the journal science in translational medicine .
former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .
the vaccination had to be given to maintain the antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical .
but the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said that a future vaccine would be administered to people , if he was sure children before they enter into temptation to try a cigarette , and thus prevent nicotine addiction .
but it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .
&quot; they know that if they begin to smoke , they feel no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them the habit , &quot; he explains .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that it was still a need for further research .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot convinces with exceptional production facilities and contemporary details , however , is also heavier than necessary .
the 1760er years playing action in france tells the poignant story of suzanne , a young nobleman who is sent by her family .
when she refuses , she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic mother superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never glides into chandeliers and sensations lust – and that is his problem .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told , makes him a nasty hair shirt for the audience .
egypt first freely elected president sworn in
mohamed morsi sets the presidential oath , but his day of triumph will not mean the end of the political disputes in egypt .
the islamist mohamed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country , and thus the succession of hosni mubarak , 16 months earlier had been expelled from office .
with his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court , which has its headquarters on the nile and is based on an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; morsi said at the ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
&quot; today the egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability , &quot; said the 60-year-old morsi , an engineer trained in the us and a member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years , mostly as an organisation banned by the respective government targeted .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building , when morsi arrived shortly after 11.00 a.m. local time in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike the presidential pomp mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic so that the auto convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre , with the southern suburbs .
as a uncharismatisches &quot; ersatzrad &quot; the brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a freitags speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the islamists , but all those who wanted the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian mubarak to your destination .
&quot; egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; said morsi judges dressed in a blue suit with a red tie in the wood-panelled chamber in which he craftsman sworn in .
later , morsi went to the university of cairo , where he should keep his antritts speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem , he was listening to habachtstellung .
the military leader field marshal hussein tantawi was present .
on his arrival , he was greeted by hundreds of those present in the largest auditorium of the university with chanting &quot; the army and the people are one hand &quot; .
the university was built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education in cairo has developed into a stronghold of islamist groups of students in the 1970s .
morsi , on friday a symbolic oath in tahrir square , the birth place of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of mubarak , and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers , the scaf assumed by the head of state hunted out of office .
but with the divestment of the official oath before the court and not in front of parliament , as usual , he is pandering to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
morsi &apos;s speech at the tahrir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .

frontier airlines charges for hand luggage
frontier airlines plans to require up to $ 100 for passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight .
frontier airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even though , in the announcement on wednesday that passengers should keep the entire box .
the new fee applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment of the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
frontier said it charged $ 25 if the fee will be paid in advance and $ 100 for travelers who paid only on the flight .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos; malley said the fee of $ 100 is introducing travelers to move in advance about the payment .
&quot; we do not want to calculate this sum , &quot; she said .
airlines began in 2008 , for the first and second to checked baggage fees .
passengers who tried to circumvent this , therefore , as much as possible , plugged in your hand luggage , which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat .
fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board .
o &apos; malley said , the new fee , it is not really about money .
the most loyal customers of frontier , which would have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat .
passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline , do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the flight of frontier may charge a baggage , but the next person has to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of luggage .
o &apos; malley said , the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed of the charges before they come to the flight .
the new hand baggage fee of frontier is only in the summer , we do not yet have an exact date .
passengers often grumble at baggage charges and other fees , but airlines like to fall back on .
they argue that the transportation of baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it .
many on wall street , the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most so far , however , the fingers of charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc. demanded three years ago , the first to charge for hand luggage and later , allegiant air , a low-cost carriers .
the only other airline with such a fee is the hungarian wizz air , the airline consultant jay sorensen , who closely followed the extra charges .
he estimated in a report in december 2011 that the spirit hand luggage fee $ 50 million a year equals .
sorensen , who previously held a leadership position in midwest airlines , recently flown with spirit and was curious what would happen to him on the flight , if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .
&quot; the boarding process was one of the smoothly i have experienced in my career in aviation , &quot; he said .
i expected to see gnashing and handgreifliche discussions on the flight .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and the boarding ran as lubricated . &quot;
frontier spirit is also $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
the company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice , are likely to keep the whole box and free coffee will be added .
water is still free .
us airways had briefly tried in 2008 to ask for erfrischungs drinks money , but that was seven months later , after passengers complained and had no other large company adjusted .
frontiers move to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative to customers on its own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies like orbitz 10 to 25 u.s. dollars per verkauftem ticket .
it provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to direct purchase with them via an online travel agency .
frontier is , however , most in this area .
in september , the company started , when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday the miles were again cut to 25 percent of the flight .
a flight booked with a third party with frontier brings more than 1000 miles customers therefore only 250 miles .
passengers can also book exclusively with direct purchase on the website of frontier .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the revenue fell by 9 percent and passenger capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter , as it is to read in the financial report published on wednesday by the parent company , republic airways holdings inc .
republic has tried to get the finances of frontier under control within the framework of the sale of the company .

&quot; they are convinced that their son was murdered , &quot; said benjamin crump , the lawyer of kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , to foxnews.com .
they would never have believed that he had died as they follow the sheriff .
&quot; they are of the opinion that it has no logic , against the laws of physics , as well as breach of common sense , &quot; says crump .
rather , they are convinced that the truth will be covered up in order to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of her son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came back in the bag , &quot; he commented .
us state lawyer michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnsons , since a number of important issues are still unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
his death is due to a crime ?
the moore said at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , in which direction they lead .
my goal is to find out the truth .
&quot; i believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , &quot; he said .
moore told reporters that the initial autopsy sent out that johnson had died from the effects of &quot; positions-related asphyxiation . &quot;
a second autopsy , however , have a different cause of death , moore .
&quot; there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of johnsons , he will instruct the fbi with the conduct of the investigation .

john kerry indicated with an unexpected admission , softening the defensive attitude of the us in terms of its surveillance programs , saying that the espionage was &quot; inappropriate has gone too far in some cases . &quot;
the foreign minister also admitted that he bore the responsibility for the fact that you have switched on &quot; autopilot &quot; with barack obama , as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower , but edward snowden about the nsa spying activities were publicly .

in a speech transmitted by video link on the open-government conference in london , kerry said : &quot; there is no question , the president and i and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot , simply because the ability to do so , even in the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war and , of course , goes back to 9 / 11 . &quot;
then he confessed to the first high-ranking member of the us government that the us spying have crossed a line , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it is unreasonable to have gone too far . &quot;
the president is determined to create clarity and , therefore , a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that the abuse took place .
i can assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .
kerry , however , insisted that the nsa was a force for good , and saved many lives through its surveillance operations .
he added : &quot; we are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow up themselves . &quot;
there is a radical extremism in the world , the intent is to kill people attack to blow up and governments .
so what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?
we have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learned in advance of such plans .
meanwhile , us lawmakers to travel to europe , in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged american espionage and to convince europeans of the need to continue working with the us in the anti-terror efforts , as the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs said on thursday .
senator chris murphy of connecticut , said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the european parliament and other people and be concerned about their threats to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the national security agency to anti-terrorist organisations .
&quot; it is very important for the national security interests of the united states that the europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board , &quot; said murphy , who is the first time in the senate , as a democrat and as chairman of the senate subcommittee on external relations and european affairs , in an interview in washington .
moreover , i am going to europe , in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the nsa programs .
media reports that the nsa collects millions of phone data in europe , have strained relations with some us allies , although the head of the secret service announced this week that the reports were untrue and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by nato allies and exchanged with the united states .
other revelations from cited passed on documents from snowden that the nsa &apos;s phone was monitored by german chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other state leaders around the world .
the director of national intelligence , james clapper , defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was normal on both sides .
in all the tumult , said murphy , his authority is preparing a tour of the congress , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members are to be published in the coming days .
he said the exact itinerary will be worked out .
while murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some &quot; serious words . &quot;
he said that the european governments should their people to be honest about the type of spying programs that they themselves for years .
&quot; we can change our monitoring programmes and better protect the rights of europeans , but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , &quot; says murphy .
meanwhile , stands for john kerry at the weekend , a trip to the middle east and to poland , to deal with the resentment of the us strategy in syria , egypt and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott have conflict of interests with parental leave
the billionaire and mps clive palmer says that prime minister tony abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans on parental leave , because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it .
the mining magnate , who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , the claim that when he was swept aside questions as to whether he is in a conflict .
the palmer united party could control up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes to be cut or reduced .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of abbott personally would benefit from the laws .
&quot; he is in a major conflict of interest , when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to leave , &quot; said palmer .
two months after the election , the electoral commission declared palmer with 53 votes in the recount , officially to the winner of the sunshine coast-seat of fairfax .
palmer asked for a review of the process of counting , so that this go faster .
tony abbotts daughters frances and bridget .
these elections should be decided after the end of the vote two months ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why should we have a system in which they have marched , the data into a computer , immediately and then at 6 : 30 in the evening , the outcome ?
palmer also criticised the use of pencils with marking the ballot .
you use it , because then you can erase the results , if they do not like ?
nowadays , with pencils is unbelievable .
the election commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a common law proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that his policy of an international airport for the sunshine coast , and that he will take his new office &quot; very seriously &quot; .
in a public office is at the service of the public .
&quot; we strive for any reward except the history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , &quot; he said .
esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .
distant worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars , astronomers have already found .
if there is at least some of them life , nobody knows .
the selection is difficult : you should look for gravitational waves ?
or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or searching for earth-like planets , and thus perhaps discovering alien life ?
these questions are just the leaders of the european space agency ( esa .
they are looking for ideas for its program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is around one billion euros .
the start will be expected to 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of september , met in paris , the elite of european space research , to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 were ideas for debate , five of them have now been shortlisted .
many bodies evaluate the proposals to push for the researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will fall through the scientific program committee .
a total of four major issues has selected the esa , to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot; cosmic vision &quot; to find answers .
what are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
the exact processes for the development of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .
and when a star has a planet , under what circumstances can arise ?
in order to analyse this issue in 2017 to launch the space telescope &quot; cheops , &quot; with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood .
the possibilities are limited , but cheops is a small mission , with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , astronomers could erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases , which are regarded as an indicator for biological activity .
how does the solar system ?
ultimately , this issue is to provide information about which there are conditions for the emergence of life .
plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particles of radiation emanating from him with the planetary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be an example .
with the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; esa already has a mission of the m-class ( the budget is around half a billion euros ) approved for this question .
the probe will start in 2017 and closely monitor the sun &apos;s surface and activity .
of great interest to the researchers are also jupiter and its moons .
they want to find out what the role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
the esa is the first of a total of three missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; program .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its journey expected to 2022 .
eight years later , they reached jupiter and examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of europe , kallisto and ganymede .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid .
maybe there are deviations , the physicists could point the way to a new theory that combine all known laws of nature .
how the universe is and what it is ?
13.7 billion years ago , the cosmos was created by the big bang .
in addition to the usual matter to us , from the stars , planets and creatures like us , there is dark matter , whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy clusters , and dark energy , which is accelerating the expansion of the universe .
so far , the researchers do not know what the laws of physics in the first split second of &apos; big bang &apos; were valid , nor what is dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; euclid , &quot; the esa has already granted a mission , whose launch is planned for 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process .
the best chances of approval as l-mission , according to many experts &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a claim concept for the detection of gravitational waves .
among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that albert einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
elisa could create the hope , the scientists behind the project .
the mission provides a detector for two or three existing probes , which will be stationed in space .
he could , in contrast to plants on earth gravitational waves , which are in the big bang , and provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos .
four other proposals are competing for the second l-mission : a large x-ray telescope named &quot; athena &quot; , which will explore , among other things , black holes , &quot; icy planets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; prism , &quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; exoplanet finder &quot; to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet .
already , among other proposals on the sample-return transport from mars , to the exploration of the moon , venus and asteroids and the solar physics .
cdc publish allergy guidelines for schools
published on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools .
these are the first such directives issued by the us government , as the number of school children with food allergies .
one in 20 children in the united states now has a food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children , according to the cdc has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools , the faculty and staff to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools epinephrin stock – the auto-injection of the brand epipen is used most frequently – in order to meet a potentially lethal Überempfindlichkeits reaction .
the legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can epinephrin easier to hold .
the report also includes a list of typical symptoms of children who have an allergic reaction .
children might say : &quot; it feels as if something is on my tongue , &quot; &quot; my tongue feels as if a hair on my tongue , &quot; or &quot; tickles . &quot;
firefighters called to the rescue of a hündchens , 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff was stranded in a quarry
cockerspaniel dog ruby was gone after a minor traffic accident
three days later she was discovered by a strollers in the quarry in their predicament
firemen seilten on rock wall and saved the dog before the safe death
firefighters managed to bring a little dog in security that was stranded on a 15-metre high ledge in a rock wall .
the nine-month-old cockerspaniel dog ruby was gone after a traffic accident on sunday afternoon and survived only three days before she was rescued on wednesday from a quarry .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , which includes the dog , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west york hire to ruby to receive and to thank the firefighters of the west &apos;s cambridgeshire fire and rescue service .
they were desperately looking for their missing dog and requests for help in social networks , when she was bolted after the traffic accident in the quarry .
at approximately 2 : 15.00 p.m. on wednesday saw a walkers , said his dog , ruby stranded on the 15-metre high paragraph in the quarry .
the technical rescue team of cleckheaton fire station rushed to the spot and seilte to rescue rubys , which was then transported in a hundebox upwards .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; she was in a dangerous situation .
it was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters away from the top and the bottom .
they moved a muscle during their rescue – as she was frozen stiff .
but now it is good .
she has eaten a couple of dogs .
it was a very unusual .
the fact that the dog was discovered , is unbelievable .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; ruby had a giant luck . &quot;
there was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse .
ruby was brought to the veterinarian to investigate , but found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west york , said : &quot; watching the rescue was frightening . &quot;
i could not believe it was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back to the poor .
the vet said that if the exhaustion has become too big and it would have collapsed , it would probably have crashed .
the firefighters have done an outstanding job .
it was really brave , what they have done .
we are just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keighley added : &quot; we were afraid that they would fall off , but they remained above . &quot;
the firefighters were great .
i can hardly believe , where she was .
us border : &quot; super-tunnel discovered &quot; for drug smuggling
on the border between mexico and the us investigators have a &quot; super-tunnel &quot; discovered the drug smuggling and decommissioned .
as the us customs authorities , more than 500 meters long tube between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and a belüftungs plant .
three suspects were arrested , seized eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine .
the tunnel was , according to the data has not yet been taken into use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could by digging under the radar , &quot; said the general state of us district of southern california , laura duffy , at a press conference in a warehouse in san diego , where it was discovered at the end of the tunnel .
at the drug gangs assured duffy : &quot; if you continue to build this tunnel and tried to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a perpetual battle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , have been killed in mexico , more than 77,000 people associated with drug-related crime .
constructed by experts
because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators estimate that it was designed by architects and engineers and construction took about a year .
the track layout was equipped so that they could be used in electric-powered cars .
on the mexican side is access to a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a director of 20 meters in depth to the tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and width of 90 centimeters .
he would also have been suited to encourage illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-fund .
the third , mexicans , was taken because of the confiscated marijuana .
all three threatens a maximum penalty of life imprisonment withdrawal , as officials said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , it was said at the press conference in san diego .
but it is the first time that cocaine in such a tunnel has been found .
normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; despair &quot; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said bill sherman from the dea drug searches in san diego .
they would do everything possible to get to the united states .
the detainees were announced no details , at least one was mexicans , it said .
they must count on prison sentences of up to ten years .
obama &apos;s climbdown in health policy
after intense criticism yesterday , president obama backed down on his oft-repeated , clear promise : &quot; if you like your health insurance , then you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter kündigungs , republicans threw the president in recent days that he had misled the american public .
yesterday , obama watered down his original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance , they can , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , obama called for those americans who have received such messages , to look on the free market after a new insurance .
most citizens could get a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than predicted .
&quot; they get a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance , would have to look for another tariff , as their contract does not meet the new standards after the affordable care act .
&quot; i would like to say to those americans directly : they deserve better than this , &quot; said sebelius at a hearing before the energy and commerce committee of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care act , said that the launch of the online platform was &quot; miserable &quot; since october .
&quot; i am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , &quot; she said .
i am determined to regain your confidence .
this quote a sebelius to a seated behind her advisor at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives was recorded after a dispute with the republican legislators billy long of missouri , it was a question of whether it should be obliged to participate in obamacare .
after more than three hours of hearing long sebelius repeatedly pressed on the question of why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care act did not voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance , in order to conclude a collective at healthcare.gov , which it now wishes to sell millions of americans .
parents of inter-sex children can choose &quot; sex &quot; undetermined
germany is the first european nation , in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals .
newborn is no longer rigidly assigned male or female .
under the new law , parents must declare no sex for such children , but can &quot; undecided &quot; or &quot; not &quot; on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents , so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding operations for a gender assignment in newborns , and to combat discrimination against inter-sexual people .
a sexual person said , according to bbc years later : &quot; i am neither man nor woman . &quot;
i remain a patchwork quilt that was created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
schätzungs , one of 2000 children each year , either as a boy or a girl .
they belong to the sexual interaction , a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot; sexualdifferenzierungsstörung &quot; ( dsd ) , an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testicles ) or unusually developed genitals .
wallis simpson was perhaps more sexually .
the understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the u.s. , you should use the best available information on gender assignment , if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child , before you decide , if any , for an operation .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said the new german law &quot; sound &quot; for a good cause .
sexual interaction children an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but that does not apply to most children , &quot; he said .
it could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait and see how the identity is developing .
the scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity , are not very accurate .
no one knows why it happens .
it is like the mystery of why people are gay .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is claimed that inter-sexual people from trans sexual or trans-gender people , because their status is not gender-related , but due to their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female exclusively , but typically both at the same time , or not clear as one of them .
these characteristics were bailed in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormones .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter-sexual and gender-trans exposed persons in professional life and about the extent of harassment , violence and crime prejudice .
not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp .
in the meantime , it is possible in australia and nepal for adults , on official documents , male or female &quot; third sex &quot; .
in june , australians norrie may-welby ( 52 ) as the world &apos;s first &quot; sex &quot; person , after a court had granted the long life of maintaining a &quot; undefined &quot; gender status .
german identity cards , in addition to m and w , in future , a third assignment , x for sexually , the ministry of interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial , as a news story on france 24 .
in 2011 , signed dozens of french members of the strict catholic country a petition that the &quot; gender theory &quot; should be removed from school textbooks .
the us website catholic online has also spoken out against the german law on the grounds that &quot; if the world is being dragged into a new state , where the sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist another two pillars of civilization . &quot;
the mother of a newborn in maryland told baby zone , it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned a gender .
&quot; the parents &apos; existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , &quot; she said the parents &apos; website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who were born with both male and female parts , as hermaphroditen , according to the attractive greek god who had both sexes .
ten years ago , the medicine regarded sex as something that can be erased and then rebuild .
but now doubted the ethical foundations of an operation , now know how complex is the gender identity , and that doctors can be wrong , because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation .
&quot; the middle of the 20th century , we called this a &quot; psychiatric emergency &apos; , &quot; said drescher .
if such a child was born , then it is not called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to dr. john money of johns hopkins university , argued that the sex was malleable .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives , such as the parents of a child , educate beings interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined as to whether a person is a male or female .
but in a notorious case under the title &quot; john / joan &quot; from 1966 his theories were controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision , castrated the child and to remove his testicles and then bring him as a girl .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but he did not , &quot; says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he committed suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , survivors of these sex operations to the public , who are not happy with the result . &quot;
for example , jim bruce , a 36-year-old writer from montana , who was born with xy male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .
the doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris , or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a &quot; satisfactory &quot; life as a man .
so external body and testicles shortly after birth were surgically removed in 1976 , and he was brought up as a girl .
he received female hormones at the age of 12 .
&quot; i knew that i am not a girl , &quot; he told abcnews.com
i was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he should receive a vaginalplastik .
but , because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he asked for his medical records .
what he found was shocking .
i was at my birth – and no one has ever said .
bruce was born with a dsd , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals .
after he had learned the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts .
the operation has become infertile .
today he is fighting for others in an organisation called interface project for more sexual people are perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , leader of the california-based law group advocates for informed choice , worries that the german law &quot; for stamping and encourage stigmatisieren .
&quot; many activists are concerned that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a &apos; not &apos; , &quot; she explained .
we fear that favours intervention .
we think it would be better to wait for the male or female sex and then .
but we still do not know how the law will have an impact , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said her organization supported the australian law , &quot; because it allows adults recognition as a third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , &quot; she said .
the german law is about the allocation at birth .
this is not a fight to force young children at this time .
when they grow up , they can decide on their bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz , a brustradiologin from pitts burg , who has a daughter with a sexual differenzierungs disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the german law &quot; authorize &quot; both parents and children .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgenresistenz .
because of the rezeptordefektes target cells for testosterone katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but not a uterus and no ovaries .
today , katie is 29 and married ; she works at the university of pennsylvania as an assistant in the child psychiatry .
it is barren , but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , so they do not have to make decisions in haste , &quot; said baratz .
it gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; .
in this way , everything is in order – the child is large and loves it .
we have a wonderful baby and the parents of happiness .
and we must not rush to make an operation that will not undo .
&quot; this includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that reconciles the parents because they believe that they would not do the right thing , &quot; she explained .
ultimately , the child decides on the sex , which fits better with him – and it is wonderful .
children will be in a position to take the decision itself .

fancy ice cream that glows in the dark ?
a british businessman has developed the first in the dark luminous ice – with the help of jellyfish .
charlie francis , the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties .
the idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially .
when eating the ice cream reacts with the tongue , making the ph value is raised in the protein and the lights .
chris explains the ices in response to the heat in the mouth and may shine unto – the more you licks , the lighter it is .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i am delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is unbelievable , but still at a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams of 200 pounds . &quot;
the protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral ph .
when the mouth warms the protein , the ph value shines and the ice .
we have tested it in recent months , and it seemed to us to bring it to halloween on the market , because it has this wonderful leuchteffekt .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever made , because the quallenleuchtstoff is four times more expensive than gold .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious .
charming read experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual taste , which include beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but his latest creation will be even more ambitious .
he says : &quot; i would like to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
it is impossible because of the refraction , which is caused by the ice , from which there is ice cream , but i suspect that we will find a way to do it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish , which are artificially produced by chinese scientists

google , samsung , huawei sued for nortel &apos;s patents
the group , which owns thousands of former nortel patents , strengte on thursday an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company , which was outbid on the bankruptcy auction of nortel .
rockstar , the consortium , which had bought the nortel patents for 4.5 billion u.s. dollars , sued samsung electronics co ltd , htc corp , huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the u.s. district court in texas .
rock star is located in the community-owned by apple , microsoft , blackberry , and sony ericsson .
google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .
the patents affect technology that searches on the internet with relevant advertising in line , the lawsuit that goes to the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives from samsung , huawei , htc and rock star were not immediately reachable .
samsung , huawei and htc phones , with google &apos;s android operating system that is in sharp competition on the mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google gave an initial bid of $ 900 million for nortel patents .
google has increased its offer several times , most recently offered $ 4.4 billion .
after it was outbid by rockstar in nortel &apos;s patents , google bought motorola mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was motivated partly by motorolas library of patents .
&quot; although google has failed in its attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents at the auction , google has infringed its patents and continues to do so , &quot; the letter of complaint .

frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
parking in frankfurt could soon be sensitive to more expensive .
the municipality of the city advises this morning on a presentation of verkehrsdezernent stefan majer ( green ) .
so the parking fees will be increased by 50 percent .
but it should not be raised the prices , but the time interval of park watches and parkscheinautomaten from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december must then decide the councillor assembly .
the retail trade committee of the chamber of commerce holds the frankfurt &quot; is not a good idea . &quot;
the possibility of parking directly in front of the business is &quot; a significant advantage for smaller retailers . &quot;
germany &apos;s transport club believes that an increase in two decades is &quot; very appropriate and long overdue . &quot;
public transport will also be more expensive .
oil prices have further to $ 96 per barrel
the price of oil has also continued to fall on friday , after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that china &apos;s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .
the referenzrohölsorte for deliveries in december was in the late morning in europe in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange at 14 cents to $ 96.24 per barrel .
the contract fell 39 cents on thursday , which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in october .
the great supply of crude oil has impacted prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy said on wednesday , the us offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
in the course of five weeks , the offer was increased by 25 million barrels .
but on friday , there were indications of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this suggests a continued recovery of china &apos;s economy , whose growth to 7.8 percent in the third quarter when it was in the previous quarter , the lowest in two decades .
crude oil from the brent variety , a benchmark for international crude oil , which is also used by u.s. refineries , fell by 26 cents to 108.58 dollars a barrel on the ice exchange in london .
the disposable society does not think .
the night was long , loud music and the mood well , but at some point , it is home .
only in the bellies of people on the front and rear seat of hunger is apparent .
clearly , a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it !
what is more , as gechillt next drive-in to take a bite ?
i admit that i am happy with it , if it is late at night or early morning to fast-food fetching .
some fries , a coke and a burger - and then as the home and into bed !
but on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gängern .
what must be a missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window ? !
especially at the weekends are weggeworfene paper bags at the periphery and parking lots .
&quot; why ? &quot; , i wonder .
the people are too stupid to take the bags back home or to the nearest dustbin ?
it is not just that the paper disfigured the landscape .
bags have already covered transport facilities such as guard rails and triggered accidents .
so what does this &quot; disposable society &quot; but not , they probably do not even know what the word actually means .
if one is more often , especially with several people in the car , you know how a bank can look after celebrating nights : clothing , bottles and other rubbish are there .
there were a few more or less bags but also nix , in contrast to the street , where nobody wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln .
i can already see the day when the cities and towns to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains must demand deposit for their bags .
milk and egg alternatives in the overview
vegane diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
pürierter tofu with cream plants is an example , quark .
further calls vegetarierbund to weltvegantag on 1 november .
the vegetarierbund germany proposes on the occasion of the weltvegantags on 1 november , a series of vegan alternatives :
pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter , yogurt will be replaced by soy yogurt .
instead of soy milk , oats , almond or rice milk can be used .
aufschlagbare plants replace traditional cream whipped cream .
also there are eggs herbal alternatives .
a half-crushed , ripe banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .
also apfelmus 50 grams or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for them .
doughs are loosely with egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder , a tablespoon of starch and three esslöffeln mineral water .
but even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk strained tofu can serve this purpose .
according to the vebu feed currently around 800000 people in germany are vegan , purely vegetable .
a black box in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system , and believe the solution to be found in a small black box , the space in the dashboard of each car .
the devices , which are all mileage and the information to the authorities , heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the planning offices of the federal states to revise the outdated system of financing american roads .
the normally rather boring road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances .
libertarian have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government of the small boxes to record mileage – and possibly , where they were – and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection concerns .
but while the congress cannot agree on an approach that several federal states wait no longer .
they are currently looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years , in which drivers pay per mile driven .
thousands of drivers have the tachograph , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring , already tested .
this really is a must for our country .
&quot; there is nothing that we may only be used , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , business leaders of the southern california assn. of government , which is planning a record of miles in all california motorists in the federal state in 2025 .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is funded from the taxes that americans pay at the pump is broke .
but in america is no longer fueled up as much as before .
cars use less fuel .
the state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per liter ) has not increased in 20 years .
politicians dare not at high gasoline prices to raise the tax by a penny .
&quot; the gasoline tax is simply not capable of the future , &quot; says lee munnich , an expert on traffic law at the university of minnesota .
his federal state has recently 500 cars equipped with recording a mileage-based payment system will be tested .
&quot; the long term is the most sensible alternative , &quot; he said .
bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee .
not surprisingly , the idea is popular with urban liberals , because the tax could be example of ways to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced .
the californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies , in order to achieve the ambitious , statutory goals of the federal state on climate change .
but the republican bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also said that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation are amused by the idea of drivers to pay back chosen route .
&quot; this is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , &quot; says adrian moore , vice president for directives in reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two previous american transport ministers , who had asked the congress in a report in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing .
the us senate last year approved an expensive $ 90 million pilot project , which includes 10000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of members from rural areas , the people who must often many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several federal states and cities are moving nichtsdestotrotz on their own in this direction .
the most active is oregon , which is currently being recruited by 5000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country .
these drivers will soon pay the fees miles instead of the petroleum tax to the federal state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city also is considering .
illinois is testing it in limited with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 federal states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently studying how to introduce the amendment .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices , car drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements .
&quot; concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , director of strategy and management at the transport ministry of nevada .
people do not want it .
when the trial started , the aclu of nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph in adult monitoring devices . &quot;
there is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
nevada is one of a number of federal states , which are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can collect the mileage , but not exactly when and where .
so , khan , the public would also be comfortable .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called true mileage in california .
the company is not originally set out to help federal states in the taxation of drivers .
rather , it was their goal , in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers pay on the basis of miles .
but the tested devices are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information , which are regularly uploaded via modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded , &quot; said ryan morrison , business manager of true mileage .
big mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in oregon experiment the planners to give drivers a range of options .
you can opt for a device with or without gps .
or they choose any device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the federal state .
others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with a smaller number who .
in new york city traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation , which also pay parking fees , insurance must be paid for driving distances and speed data in real time by other vehicles , thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams .
&quot; motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system provides for participation , &quot; says a planning document of the city .
some traffic planners , however , are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge ablenkungs maneuvers .
the metropolitan transportation commission in the area of the san francisco bay officials declared that congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-off fee , or an annual levy motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline will be imposed , so that they pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no need for an operation , albeit an aspirin is sufficient , &quot; explains randy rentschler , director of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists about their privacy and many other things .
bad dürrheim : a dream comes true for fc
the importance of the city and the football club forfeited the official einweihungs celebration for the kunstrasen sports ground , despite the cold weather and no rain .
a pleasant ceremony had all wanted last saturday , but peter did not play .
so all those who had the disadvantage that came without an umbrella or such for some reason could not hold .
it was the musicians who rounded up the ceremony , as well as some of the speakers .

this human values voluntary commitment also paid tribute to the provincial mps karl rombach .
other greetings said hubert baier , the district chairman of the südbadischen football association , kuno kayan , and friedrich knorr of the planning office for the urban sports committee announced a donation for the youth department of the club .
mayor klumpp brought that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn , the original space afflict so that he could not be played .
already 15 years ago , there were the first thoughts to solve the problem , as was the construction of a third place in the grounds of football clubs or at the secondary school at the salinensee .
both have been discarded .
six years ago thoughts came to the establishment of a kunstrasensportplatzes in what was widely regarded as the ultimate solution .
specific plans were two years ago , when the club took over the schabelstube supreme , promised a cost-sharing of 100000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104000 euros .
the council decided in october 2012 , the acquisition of the remaining 356000 euros of the total cost of 560000 euros , summarized klumpp .
the construction of the artificial turf pitch 68 times 108 meters on 4 june .
during the three months of construction were 3000 cubic meters of earth , half of which is used for the establishment of a dirt-bike route .

snowden ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany on us surveillance
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , said that he was prepared to travel to berlin and testify before the german bundestag , when the american national security agency and its director keith alexander no answers about their activities .
the german mep hans-christian stroebele met snowden on thursday in russia , where he has received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , who on friday from stroebele presented to the media in berlin , writes : &quot; even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to be a dissenting opinion as loyalty and tries to criminalise freedom of political expression with criminal threat , no defence . &quot;
to tell the truth , however , is not a crime .
in the letter , snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community to persuade the american government could drop the charges against him .
the trial by the us department of justice includes espionage and theft of state property .
the german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said over time online : &quot; when mr snowden is ready to talk with german representatives , we will find ways to make it possible . &quot;
relations between the us and germany have been strained by the claims that the nsa had tapped the phone of chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness , if this is possible , &quot; without endangering him and totally ruining relations with the us . &quot;
stroebele , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was accompanied by two german journalists during his visit to russia .
stroebele said that according to the lawyer of former nsa contractor snowden could not return to russia , if he leave the country .
if snowden aussage in germany , he will need an assurance that he was &quot; safe &quot; , as the honourable member .
snowden stated in his letter that he would face a &quot; serious and ongoing persecution &quot; campaign , which was driven from his home .
however , he was touched by the global response to &quot; my act of political freedom of expression . &quot;
people around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the united states , the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive surveillance system known as a credit to the public .
in his letter to snowden , the german authorities an offer of cooperation , &quot; if the difficulties were resolved about the humanitarian situation . &quot;
security concerns grow in mozambique in the face of clashes between influential personalities
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , founder and first president of mozambique , in a rare public demonstration of peace .
&quot; we want peace , we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , leader of an investment company .
they fear for the future of the country has exchanged their clothing business against a t-shirt with the inscription &quot; we demand security &quot; in portuguese , and on thursday joined the crowd on the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks , there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement , more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , which was initially supported by the white-ruled rhodesia and later the apartheits south african government in a bid to destabilise the independent government of the country .
it has become an opposition party after the peace treaty in 1992 .
analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict trap , but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals .
for the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring into the country in the next few years , investments of more than $ 50 billion from companies like rio tinto and vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko from the us .
the ruling frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and renamo are blaming each other for the tensions .
renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacked on october 17 , its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold renamos .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops renamo-bases attacked and attempted to kill afonso dhlakama , leader of the group , renamos spokesman told the financial times .
the government gives renamo the blame for the clashes and the organisation accused of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .
he told afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhlakama himself as a &quot; loser &quot; , the &quot; all its remaining forces wants to prove that the government can impose its decisions . &quot;
both frelimo and renamo stress that they want to avoid a war .
but the concerns have increased since mazanga was quoted as saying that renamo the peace agreement of 1992 .
he told the ft that he had meant that frelimo no longer respect the agreement .
&quot; our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously , &quot; said mazanga .
earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year .
&quot; here we have two adult men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who heads collide , &quot; says joseph hanlon , a lecturer at the open university and mozambique expert .
none of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , which is pushing for electoral reforms , has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government .
renamos electoral successes shrink since 1992 , while a new party , which was founded by a former renamo member movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , is likely to improve in the elections .
mazanga claimed that guebuza – whose resignation , when his second term ends next year , wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , &quot; mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo , but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links .
most of the fighting took place in the province of sofala , located a few hundred kilometers north of maputo in beira , but use of the port , mining companies like rio tinto and vale for the export of coal .
in june , rio had announced a month for the use of the railways , after renamo an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo will repeat that threat .
renamo wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things are not going well in mozambique , &quot; said mazanga .
the instability have increased the frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of media coop , an independent media company , because many people already were concerned about the corruption , the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping .
&quot; people think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , &quot; he says .
omar sultans , a protestor , said that people simply wanted stability .
&quot; not interested in renamo and frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , &quot; he said .

nsa declared that an &quot; internal error &quot; and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
the shadow national security agency said late on friday that a mistake had crippled its public website a few hours and not hackers , as has been claimed .
&quot; nsa.gov was tonight for some hours unreachable , because an internal error occurred during a planned updates , &quot; explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail .
the problem will be fixed on this evening .
the claim that the outage was caused by a carried out distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attack that was not true .
in the early evening hours online server sites had noticed that the nsa &apos;s website for at least six hours was not achievable and for some users .
previously , a spokesman for the nsa told abc news , the sensitive internal network of the authority was &quot; in no way compromised . &quot;
secret information were not in danger , according to the spokesman .
at least one group of hacktivisten took claims to have the nsa website with a ddos attack .
such attacks will be the target site with pages flooded until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .
the cyber tactic is relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .
in the past was super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no search agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and , after the sharp criticism in recent months reported revelations about their extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret nsa data stolen and published by the disillusioned former nsa employee edward snowden .
the growing controversy over the secret service modifying initial speculation about today &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .
snowden could also testify in russia
the former us intelligence expert edward snowden could make statements in the us spähaffäre in his russian asylum .
representatives of the federal general state prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or the 30-year-olds personally in russia .
it reported the agency interfax , citing not named circles who are familiar with the situation .
such a question could be resolved intergovernmental , it said .
a snowden &apos;s departure from russia is virtually impossible .
in this case , &quot; he loses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quoted its source .
because germany is an ally of the united states , snowden threatens the extradition , it said further
children should receive myths and legends as &quot; role models for life &quot; , says the author .
the stories of thor showed that &quot; brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , &quot; and the arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
many of the myths , however , are too dirty &quot; far too wild , offensive and , in some cases , to be taught in schools , &quot; why crossley-holland pleaded &quot; age just works for a careful selection . &quot;
&quot; i think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in america are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i proposed this for 20 years as a plan .
he added , authors and teachers who are &quot; overly didactic , &quot; children were &quot; completely off , &quot; because in entertaining stories &quot; subliminal &quot; messages .
crossley-holland , beowulf translated from the saxon , and is the author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales , said : &quot; you can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults , and an author who writes for children , is the need to give hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .
this must be subliminal , revealed by history and not be explained .
that is the old story of showing rather than telling .
they thought , travel agencies are thanks to the internet in the past ?
flight centre seems to defy the trend .
the company has increased its earnings outlook for the full year and expects record earnings from holiday makers in australia and britain .

the innovations that accumulated credits earmarked in the parishes .
by contrast , the liabilities to the whole community .

tax on foreign property owners against london &apos;s speculative bubble
the treasury has provisionally calculated by the cgt-measure , but is still waiting for the final decision by chancellor of the exchequer george osborne , who had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on homes in the 2012 budget , which cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers , the apartments as a company and not as individuals .
already exceed the revenue from the stamp tax on property in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , the tax year 2012 / 13 at 708 million pounds , the proceeds for northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north-east , north-west , york and the humber region .
cook said : &quot; after the increase in the stamp tax on hochpreisige apartments and the introduction of the related legislation on an exemption , one can hardly say that high quality properties are under-taxed , regardless of the consequences of the outdated municipal tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this step could make some foreign investors cautious about buying properties in london , or discourage owners to sell , &quot; he added .
first-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market price – in the affluent southwest london belt , which stretches from fulham to wimbledon , have increased to a record of 11.8 % last year .
prices in central london highlighted a steady annual growth rate of 5.6 % , but by an emerging &quot; overshadowed domestic market , &quot; on the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , a study of savills .
even if the sg achim / baden for four days is without a victory , the handball-oberligisten still good mood .
this coach tomasz malmon leaves no doubt about that .
all are fully motivated .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i know no longer , as a victory , &quot; malmon expected a success of his team at vfl fredenbeck ii .
although the third league reserve from fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted , malmon in advance warning of the finger .
many players i myself have trained in the a-youth .
therefore , they will surely be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .
&quot; it is also to be seen whether then reinforcements from the first , &quot; the sg-coach .
at last , to return to the track , success needs to increase the malmon team compared to the previous appearances , in any case .
above all , in the deckungs work and umschaltspiel suffered last but enormous .
the chances of recovery must definitely be better .
i therefore hope that , at last , my players during the short break free of the head .
us wants to continue to prosecute snowden
the us has not changed its position on the former us intelligence contractor edward snowden employees .
he will continue to be accused of hacking secret information .
therefore , it should be a criminal trial in the united states , said the spokeswoman of the us state department , jennifer psaki , in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change this .
previously , the german green politician hans-christian stroebele , after a meeting with snowden in moscow calls on the united states , not to threaten him with further punishment .
psaki stressed that ströbeles statements was a parliamentarian and not that of a german government member .
report : obama campaign considered to replace biden by hillary clinton
the closest advisers of president barack obama discussed in secret to replace vice president joe biden in the election campaign in 2012 by hillary clinton , the new york times .
the revelation is the beachtenswerteste surprise of the long-awaited work by mark and john get effects on the 2012 election campaign , &quot; double down : game change 2012 &quot; .
the times received a copy of the forthcoming book , and they reported on thursday evening that the topberater the president had &quot; conducted extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 &quot; to find out if it turned out better for obama &apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election if he let biden .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent for the times , the book thoroughly the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the white house , notably the former white house chief of staff bill dalex to measure the effect on the poll numbers to replace the former secretary of state clinton against the vice-president .
the potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and in the oval office .
only half a dozen of the closest adviser to the president – including dalex , the former head of obama &apos;s campaign , jim messina , and the former senior white house adviser david axelrod and david plouffe , knew about the planned change .
in &quot; double down &quot; is claimed , dalex have been at the forefront of efforts to exchange biden , despite their &quot; close personal relationship &quot; , before eventually decided against such a move , after the data showed that clinton &apos;s candidacy , &quot; the chances of obama would not significantly improve . &quot;
in an interview with martin dalex confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace biden by clinton .
&quot; i made a whole series of things that we should consider , and that was one of them , &quot; said the magazine dalex .
we must remember that the president had terrible poll numbers , so we thought : &quot; for god &apos;s sake , what do we do ? &quot;
dalex during the investigation , described as &quot; due diligence , &quot; said martin had operated with anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move to the ballot box auszahle .
&quot; in campaigns is not so much money spent on surveys and focus groups , if not seriously thinking about something , &quot; said martin on ac360 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange .
martin said on cnn that he had dalex asked whether his former boss had known about the potential change .
although dalex declared that he did not believe that the president of the possible change &quot; was aware &quot; , the former chief of staff admitted that it was &quot; possible &quot; that obama was aware of it .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings had reached obama &apos;s desk .
martin cooper asked if he seriously think that obama did not know anything about the investigations as to whether one should biden during the elections .
&quot; possible , &quot; said martin .
local council appreciates sound budget
whenever it comes to the budget in council meetings , mayor ralph gerster , has a good laugh .
the gemeindesäckl in wangen stove-schönach is well stocked and debt already knows the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 budget can be booked as an unqualified success in this respect .
this was evident in the presentation of the annual bill for 2012 .
as andrea roth mouth explained , is the administrative budget of around eur 7.6 million over a million euros higher than planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget is around one million euros over the approach , with about 1.8 million euros .
thanks to the surplus mainly higher business tax revenues and the share of the income tax .
the household wealth again was significantly higher than the planned values .
instead of the planned amounted to eur 1.5 million in the last year of eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is due largely to the higher allocation from the administrative budget , &quot; says roth .
as fewer investments have been made as planned in the 2012 budget , is also the supply of reserves .
overall , the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros .
mayor ralph gerster , thanked roth and her team for their excellent work .
&quot; a work not just shakes &quot; from the sleeve , praised gerster , with a view to the year .
he and the local councils rejoiced visibly on the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good numbers could soon be citizens dearly .
the good financial position , the community could forgo high rates in the past .
this , in turn , but several times , according to gerster , subsidies have been cut from the country .
there are conditions for these grants from various compensation .
among other things , the cities and towns to apply for the grants , certain rates .
&quot; the issue of lifting rates , we have to look at , because in the coming years , investment , for which we would like to support , &quot; gerster , announced in this context .

verzweiflungs cry of an obama voter
i have twice elected president obama in the hope that change is possible
he says that obama has lobens values , efforts have been frustrated by the blocking tactics by republicans
the blockade policy does not condone the website problems of obamacare , the drone strikes
obama &apos;s memoir about the 2008 election campaign , a sad reminder of what would have been possible
nathaniel p. morris is a student at harvard medical school in the second year .
i read a terribly sad book .
it is a book that i thought i would be cheering up during the sad second year of my medical degree and give me hope .
it is called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( courage ) and describes the memoirs of barack obama for the 2008 presidential election .
when i am finished the evening with my patients and go to bed , then the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches were breathtaking .
the election was held to a landslide victory and newsreaders , the historical significance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
then in 2008 , obama moved into office , he had approval voting values of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a rude awakening , as if it is ripped from a dream .
it is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a faint memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i have for the first time , really has changed somewhat .
but there is simply nothing that i imagined .
i acknowledge the great and versatile things that obama has achieved by the passage of the affordable care act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of osama bin laden .
i also believe that the political party blocking tactics have too many efforts , with whom our nation should be brought forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of guantanamo bay , to name a few .
but after i have defended countless times , the obama administration with colleagues and acquaintances , i have reached the end of my trying to enlighten .
i have reached a point of political desperation .
the republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency collects data about the private lives of americans and why whistleblowers should be punished , disclose wrongdoing .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki was an american citizen state , was murdered without trial , which is why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the findings of a report which says that the efforts of the white house to restrain the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know if that is what i have expected .
if i had to understand that the government work could contradict their previous political campaigns with 18 .
apparently , the abgeordnetenamt no predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the newtown massacre shape the public debate .
but when i look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bothers me most .
i was re-elected in 2012 , obama , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative , he seemed not his direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hopes we had for so long .
but with the drop in approval voting values for obama to below 45 % this week to return to 2008 is even tougher in this book .
it gives me the longing for the many promises that have evaporated .
this week i read a section in the book , which describes how obama has had a severe loss against clinton in the primaries in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the election officials after the decision , he told his staff , they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
&quot; i want us to find our magic , &quot; he said .
we need to remember who we are .
there are five years later , mr. president , and i could not agree more .
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of nathaniel morris .
