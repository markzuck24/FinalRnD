other core subjects are changed next year .
in a separate initiative will give ofqual , the regulator for a reorganisation of the gcse structures , including a new rating system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer michael gove , the education minister , said that there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; he stressed , the gcses would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more stringent . &quot;
studies show that less time spent on math -- 116 hours per year , or three hours a week in english schools per year -- than in most other countries .
on the other hand , australian schools received an average of 143 hours a year and students in singapore 138 hours .
although there is no formal requirement , more time in the curriculum for mathematics , but from coalition circles that the comprehensive math testing , combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings , schools will probably encourage more hours .
the curriculum is more emphasis on &quot; problems of the real life , &quot; including financial mathematics .

&quot; it is not easy , &quot; said bwelle .
you can leave the house at five o &apos;clock in the morning and run to hospital , to be the first , and it is not the first .
there are a lot of patients .
some people are dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwelles father died in 2002 .
in cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , could not afford the most kameruner the visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditures are private .
&quot; the only problem they have is the poverty , &quot; bwelle said .
and the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .

dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have last year 700 free operations .
he was himself a doctor and works as a cardiovascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a nonprofit organization called ascovime , the weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care .

already they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
but when they arrive , they are welcomed as heroes : a celebration meal , singing and dancing and the best accommodation , the place has to offer .
free medical care is really a cause for celebration in these villages and bwelle , with his broad smile and boundless energy , is to the joyful celebration .
the next morning the team then starts with the examination of hundreds of patients .
&quot; we have 500 people , &quot; bwelle per trip .
they come from a radius of 60 kilometres to the village -- and the walking .
each of these wochenend clinics providing medical care in a number of areas .
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , unterernährung , diabetes , sexually transmitted diseases and parasites .
others receive crutches , gespendete glasses or free birth certificates -- a document that is necessary for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team simple operations with local anesthetic .
the operations generally take place in a school , town hall or an apartment ; after surgery are the patients and move in the recreation area to make space for the others .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment powered by the generator of the group bwelle and its volunteers to work in the early hours of the morning on sunday .
it is a demanding pensum , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
&quot; they drums all the night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; bwelle said .
on sunday , the team then goes back in the city , tired , but proud of the work .
the group -- a mixture of kamerunischen doctors and foreign medical students -- last year 700 free operations and know that their work has made a huge difference for the people who it helps .
a man said that the free operation of bars of which he received , he is allowed to return to work .
&quot; it changed the future of my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital bwelle at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job finanziere 60 % of its charitable activities , bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
&quot; i really do not know when he is sleeping , &quot; says katie o &apos;malley , studied medicine at drexel university in philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily in bwelles group mitarbeitet .
he is either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation , so that it can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , the support from the us and europe and bwelle , this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
&quot; we can be in operations , where we help blood abzutupfen or the instruments for dr. bwelle , &quot; o &apos;malley says .
that would be never possible in america as a medical student in the second year .
the students pay for their own trip to cameroon normally and bring often donated sanität material .
once they are in yaoundé , bwelle accepts the accommodation , transport and guidance .
&quot; he is undoubtedly a hero , &quot; says o &apos;malley .
he dedicated his life to this organisation and its desire to help the people of cameroon , knows no borders .
for bwelle is the almost constant work is not a burden .
other to achieve a better life and to fulfil a promise that his father gave him great pleasure .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy , if i make this work , &quot; bwelle said .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he does , what i do .
i do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .

jack valero , from catholic voices , said that the number of eligible cardinals to february will probably be dropped .
he said that a pope ernenne normally so many cardinals as necessary to keep the number of eligible cardinals 120 betrage , and so many cardinals over 80 , as it wishes .
the consistory next year is important , because it is the first since the election of francis in march of this year , valero .
at the moment , there is a certain Überhang aufseiten of europe and particularly in italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will be appointing cardinals from the rest of the world , to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of kardinälen .
the cardinals will also be the first to be appointed to the council established since the formation of the francis cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world , have the task of finding ways to reform the church .

europe &apos;s elite is ready to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the aim of the economy to bring and to define what those who wish to change our relationship with the eu in britain for prosperity and work .
to this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of british business leaders and asked them what they think about britain , the economy and the eu .
yougov interviewed over 1,000 executives from the economy , the british company sizes , sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow , while the states in the eu will stagnate .
they want that the government side new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil favorisiert , instead of concentrating on the long and arduous process to reform the obskuren eu institutions .
asked for their opinion on certain regulatory issues ranging from antitrust to product legislation -- the majority of business leaders is of the opinion that the control of these key competences should be brought back to westminster .
there was general discontent on the internal market , since the costs of brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits , according to the company , voted to be part of europe &apos;s trade zone -- even 40 % of large companies which are traditionally the most europhile .
finally , and this is probably the most , our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority of britain wants a direction change in the agreement and a relationship with the eu based on trade , not on politics .
this is in leading corporations and companies of all sizes shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change , &quot; the issue of action back to britain .
it is much better conditions for britain -- an amendment of the agreement and 16 percent would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy behind his plan for the re-negotiation of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , after the eurozone moved towards closer economic and fiskalunion now .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , which for businesses means a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the approach to brussels regulations .

when i was small , halloween something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , late aufbleiben and disguise for the neighbourhood .
today , i am more to halloween muffel .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment , and it will not do so this year .
but according to the statistics , i am a black sheep , on halloween .
the majority of americans -- 158 million , to be precise -- this year celebrating halloween and a total of $ 6.9 billion for candy , costumes and decorations from the american federation of retailers ( nrf ) .
one thing to which i am then again every halloween , the trend values .
the costumes are approximately 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , aufreizende inanimate objects of the rage .
women must no longer hüllen in sexy clothes , they can now also verführerisches food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
with regard to men , i expect a lot of zombies , thanks to the walking dead , and i bet the daft punk space men are in the instagram feeds this year .
according to google , the most sought costumes , batman , pirates , zombies and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong about tradition .
we have our dogs last year and to my surprise they were not alone .
indeed , americans $ 330 million for costumes of their pets this year , according to the nrf .
there are a lot of &quot; hot dogs . &quot;
as regards süssigkeiten , we are not zimperlich .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , the nielsen company .
that is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lollipops , candy and gum .
so the good news for the 41 million people , according to the us department of commerce with the slogan &quot; trick or treat &quot; by the district .
indeed , we are more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween buy and eat -- let us not deceive ourselves .
the only thing that we do not want to consume , is the sweet candy corn , sold 15 million kilograms of halloween , according to the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion maize grains .
it is a mystery that i could not resolve .
nothing is more to halloween than houses , where it spukt .
they have great names like &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which is in a real prison ) , &quot; howl-o-scream &quot; and &quot; the house of shock . &quot;
there are 1,200 officially recognized spuk houses in the united states , in fact , the $ 500 million erlös , america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos , in which it in the trousers pinkelt and friends on facebook , where it is not loswird again , and then type , on the one , leave a comment like &quot; nice facial expression . &quot;
but we finally come to the kürbissen .
charlie brown made us familiar with the pumpkin , when we were children , and the carving a small pumpkin lantern is decorating the christmas tree -- something that we have to .
fortunately , the &quot; baby in the pumpkin &quot; trend began only last year thanks to pinterest , so that most of us have grown up the pumpkin zuschnitzen , not to sit .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million for pumpkins , the us census bureau .
the pumpkin lantern , the slow vorgarten verrottet , probably comes from illinois , where this year 245 million kg were harvested pumpkins .
if you want to score , then you call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and schnitzen slightly hübsches of their 921-pound pumpkin .

tripodi , to have been influenced by obeid .
against the former labor minister joe tripodi from new south wales launched an investigation by the government corruption supervision .
the former nsw minister denies , the rules for leasing at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid had to have changed the ownership of three properties on state-controlled land .
on friday , the independent commission against corruption ( icac-independent commission against corruption ) has extended its investigations on the question whether obeid influenced several state ministers to circular quay leases which the obeids to extend two restaurants and a café , without tender after their expiration in august 2005 .
we are now investigating the allegation , tripodi of obeids have covered interest in the land , known as tripodis former deputy team leader lynne ash pole testified accordingly on thursday .
in years of talks , which began in 2005 , had pushed the government to tender for the leases .
furthermore , the tenants were opposed and wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , the circular quay leases for the company were $ 2.5 million annually , the obeids einbrachten , without a public tender .
tripodi , who was ports minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally called for public tenders .
but he argued that the changes made at the request of obeid , as confirmed by tripodi , had urged the government to transform the lease arrangements .
a telephone transcript was submitted to the icac talks from august and september 2007 between the ministry of obeid and tripodi , steve dunn , a senior officials , the port was changed after he had worked under obeid in the fisheries authority .
&quot; these telephone conversations besprochene issue was the preparation of commercial leasing arrangements ? &quot; asked the deputy commissioner anthony whealy tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; tripodi replied .
i do not remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
nsa revelations strengthen companies paranoia for state supervision
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew low over the us consulate in frankfurt , germany &apos;s financial capital .
on the instructions of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( bat ) , the german domestic intelligence , he should shoot the roof of the us outpost , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank and the federal bank .
according to german media the bat wanted to prove the existence of monitoring antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the united states and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , maintaining once again that the us no opportunities of foreign espionage einsetzten in september , &quot; to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of us companies to ensure that their international competitiveness or increase their profits . &quot;
but since edward snowden , the whistleblower that former employees with the publication of his füllhorns started of us surveillance secrets , heads of european governments and companies are no longer sure that they can take the manager at his word .
reports that the us national security agency and the brazilian oil company petrobras and data acquired american cloud providers , including google and yahoo , the companies paranoia for state supervision to a new peak .
the last straw was the revelation that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone verwanzt , perhaps ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can get targeted , then certainly managers potential targets .
snowden has made the intensive cooperation between us intelligence services and companies .
i believe that it is conceivable that these data be used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany needs to wake up , &quot; said oliver grün , president of the bitmi , which represents small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe the us now poses almost as big a risk as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey , published in july by the consultancy firm ey .
in the leaked documents from snowden , however , there has been no evidence so far that the us passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu lacks certain it and internet options and they should reduce their dependence on the united states .
the companies are sceptical in this regard .
the bundestag has been suggested that we should build a german google .
i can close my eyes and slowly reopen them ...
&quot; it does not work like that , &quot; says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software company sap .
if you had a strong european it industry 20 years ago , it would not disappear .
everything in germany is subsidised , from coal cars to agriculture .
everything , except for the it industry .
however , the scope and technical sophistication of the snowden revelations have shocked us spying authorities revealed companies which had seen the greatest risk of espionage in china .
the cloud computing is a big change , because european executives are now aware that the data stored in the us jurisdiction and are therefore potentially dangerous .
according to a survey by the cloud security alliance , a trade body , verwarfen after the revelations about prism , the us data mining activities , approximately 10 % of the members not residing in the united states plans to use american providers .
jim snabe , co-ceo of sap , says : &quot; we see a new issue of customers , which was not even a year ago , it is : where will my data and you can guarantee that these remain physically in this judicial area ? &quot;
many german executives believe that the recent reports just confirm what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and , therefore , they must be guarded at all costs .
that economic espionage is taking place , is no surprise .
this has always been the case .
&quot; it was an issue for many years and the current discussion has not fundamentally changed , &quot; says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans also spionieren on commercial and industrial level , as we do this , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the management prahlt not normally on the action it has taken , which affords attackers benefits .
in large companies , employees have long eingebläut that mitnehmen a free usb memory sticks at a trade fair or the unbewachte deck , a laptop in the hotel room was not advisable , to put it mildly .
ulrich hacke berk , director of car manufacturers audi , says that it is standard practice for years before a board meeting collect the phones , so that they cannot be used as listening devices .
the german bat advises managers , easy to use prepaid phones , when they go on trips abroad , because smartphones may be compromised .
the prepaid phones are thrown away .
however , there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .

&quot; the government has an emergency rescue package , which we believe that the unique challenges facing the state , &quot; said plibersek today .
the $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral services .
another 2600 operations , including orthopädischer interventions and treatments for eye cataracts , residues should be removed .

&quot; these investments reflect the ideas , clinic employees said they are concerned that the best way to improve the tasmanische healthcare system , &quot; said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tasmanischen government .
the federal government should be able to maintain the current level of funding to obtain money from the commonwealth , and monthly reporting , where the additional money has been spent .
a dreiköpfige commission will set up and is intended to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said , the $ 325 million would serve little purpose if they are not accompanied by genuine reforms , &quot; the public tasmanische health system on a sustainable path . &quot;

dick said america- the kingdom of stunning technological progress , coupled with paranoia , security , and the belief to be chosen .
dick had god experiences , his later books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
he understood early that the machines are divinitäten .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a people from a machine , the creator of his creation .
this is the problem of the &quot; blade runner . &quot;

however , dicks story is not yet complete .
the police chief complains that there is no separation of powers , the military controls the day and what is left by the state .

the court blocked decision to stop- and -frisk directive of the nypd
a federal appeals court on thursday blocked the formation of a judge in the united states , the amendments to the stop- and-frisk programme ( &quot; stop and search &quot; ) asked the new york police department , entband the judge from the case .
the 2nd u.s. court of appeal stated that the decisions by judge shira scheindlin would be exposed to determine an appeal of the city .
the judge had ruled in august that the city is against the constitution with the way in which the programme will be implemented for the stopping and questioning of persons .
the city appealed against their opinion , and the corrective measures , including the decision to establish a monitoring body , should support the police in the amendment of the directive and the training programme .
the court of appeal on tuesday heard the arguments on the suspension .
the report stated that the judge of appeal must be exempted from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for us judges , specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias ; this was partly justified with a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because it inappropriately targeted black and latin american men with the stop- and-frisk programme targeting nähmen .
it appointed an external body responsible for monitoring the implementation of key changes , including reforms in guidelines , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with cameras in areas in which most of the controls were carried out by the body .
in august , the new york city agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who have been made redundant after a control by the police .
a hearing on the appointment of the city after the march 14 , 2014 .
the stop- and-frisk tactics has been criticised by a number of public defenders .
controls of this kind are available in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded checks during the term of the parteilosen mayor michael bloomberg rose to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330 , mostly of black and latin american men .
in 2004 , the lawsuit has been filed by four men , all minority communities , developed to a sammelklage .
supporters of the nypd &apos;s stop- and-frisk programme say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and more effective police and other police chiefs , affect the way the regulation .
opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not the crime , wasted money and would not solve the wider problem of a police force under pressure after the removal of thousands of jobs in the last decade . &quot;
the judge pointed out that the stop- and -frisk practice not beende , was constitutional , but the nature of the implementation of the controls by the nypd reformiere .

hughes said that patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of jemaah islamiah , amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra , were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago .
really , this guy should above all have the death penalty .
him alive -- no , there is no reason to leave him alive .
to get 20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured hundreds , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers , the court .
he turned away from almost a decade of detention , but was finally caught in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces killed four months later the former al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
during the negotiations , an fbi agent said that the note had provided intelligence that patek was in pakistan to meet bin laden with a view to rebuild the link between southeast asian terrorist groups and al-qaeda .

profit losses for bombardier to decline in delivery figures and contracts
the canadian aircraft and train manufacturer bombardier inc on thursday reported a 15 % decline in net profit in the third quarter , after declining orders and deliveries of aircraft and contract problems in the rail sector was under pressure .
montreal-based bombardier also published a flight test data for his brand new plane the cseries and gave no new information about whether the aircraft in accordance with the ambitious schedule next september could be in commercial use .
the maiden flight of the test aircraft followed one and a half months ago , so far only three other starts , which makes it doubtful whether the testing as planned .
the results were behind the forecasts , and led to a price fall of more than eight percent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , on thursday lowered its rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; outperform &quot; in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters a limited potential .
&quot; weaker delivery figures in the aircraft were largely expected , but the margin of development in the transport sector , we are clearly disappointed , &quot; doerksen said in a customer letter .
we are of the opinion that bombardier orders for the new cseries , if the test programme for the aircraft progresses .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect that the market skeptischer to the programme .
bombardier hopes that the number of aircraft cseries can catapult the company into the lower segment , which is currently dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was unveiled in march and flew after months of delays for the first time in september .
but so far , binding orders for the cseries with 177 moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see whether the company &apos;s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet transport aircraft is accurate .
there are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets .
the company also assured on thursday to analysts and media , the programme lies in the derivatives plan .
&quot; the test aircraft is not remained on the ground longer than expected , &quot; beaudoin said in a conference call , adding during the lifetime of the aircraft were scheduled soil tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is different .
we have decided to take a first flight and then a review period , as we have done .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks , the rest afterwards , it was on the part of companies .
nevertheless , analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight of the first customer a plane cseries in operation .
bombardier said it überprüfe the planning for the commissioning ( ice ) and will update this in the next few months .
&quot; the slow progress of the flight test -- even if they clearly meet bombardier &apos;s internal planning -- reinforces our view that the commissioning to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; doerksen said .
in the third quarter ended on september 30 , bombardier &apos;s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share the year before .
the adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents .
the sales were slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had 45 deliveries this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
the net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the backlog in the aerospace sector was $ 32.9 billion on september 30 and was unchanged compared with december 31 .
&quot; in the aerospace , the results were in line with our targets , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , &quot; beaudoin said .
sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest rail manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector has increased by almost 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the backlog in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on september 30 and thus increased slightly in relation to the december 31 .
the profit margin in the field of transport was affected by problems in some large contracts .
according to corporate governance , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .
in afternoon trading on thursday , the bombardier stock by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars , after google cfo patrick pichette has also announced that the change in the board .
brazil &apos;s embraer sa and bombardier &apos;s closest rival , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly profit on thursday .
rules for electronic devices on planes remain in australia for the time being in force
australian passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones when starting and landing off , despite efforts to relax regulations for such equipment in the united states .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) allows us airlines to change their guidelines so that passengers could read e-books , watch videos or play on their flight instruments during critical phases , provided that these are in &quot; flight mode . &quot;
while the bulk of the flight passengers is already permitted , but many people find it annoying that the launch and landing their e-books is not allowed to read it .

&quot; we would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the casa , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience , we now offer wireless entertainment ) ( during the flight , &quot; said a spokesman .
qantas said that we are going to stick to the current rules .
&quot; our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment should not be used in the launch and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , &quot; the company said .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations , which can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look carefully at the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision is in us companies vary depending on the age of the fleet .
they need to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and manuals , training materials , baggage programs and customer training .
&quot; after the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can be easier for passengers using portable electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any height , &quot; the faa announced .
in rare cases , poor visibility during the landing , the crew will instruct the passengers to the equipment .
in addition , the group recommended schwerere devices when starting and landing safely under the seat or in the overhead .

scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the tail wedeln of a dog with its mood .
previous research had shown that happy dog with the tail wags more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while the left side was nervous dogs .
but now , scientists say that other dogs and respond to these subtle differences .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscience researcher at the university of trento , said : &quot; the people is well aware that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli , the positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here , we have tried to look at this in other species .
he also said that dogs , like humans the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .
to learn more about how dogs react to the side tail wedeln their own species , the researchers monitored the animals , while these films other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the vierbeiner and analysierten behavior .
we will probably understand why the tail in one , sometimes in the other direction
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have shown the dogs films with dogs -- either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail to the left or right . &quot;
if the animals saw an otherwise ausdruck dog has moved the cart to the right ( from the perspective of the wedelnden dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but the tail was mainly left again ( from the perspective of the dog wedelt ) , their heart rate rose and they saw unruhig .
in the opinion of professor vallortigara the dogs not deliberately communicate with each other by these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience , what movements they should worry and when not .
he said : &quot; if you have several meetings with other dogs and the wedeln with the cock in a direction more linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produced a less friendly behaviour , we responded on the basis of this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that the findings could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal dog owners , veterinarians and trainers .
dog behaviour expert john bradshaw and visiting fellow at the faculty of veterinary medical science at the university of bristol , said this was not the first study investigated whether the left and right is essential for dogs .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln found that dogs , if they see an aggressive dog , turn the head left and right , if it is a happy dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada said : &quot; dogs go on to be a robot dog , tail &apos; wedelt left rather than right , rather than being unruhig -- exactly the opposite than in the italian study . &quot;
according to his statement , hence the differences that the dogs could not interpreted as dogs in the various studies of animals in the movies or the robot dogs .
a study how dogs respond to real dogs , could help , he said .
&quot; although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two halves of the brain used for various purposes , but many of the details still need to be determined , and dogs are no exception , &quot; says bradshaw .
however , since their behaviour simply aufzeichnen , it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail moved sometimes in one direction , sometimes in the other .

pfand houses boomen arrived in singapore , since the crisis in the middle class
in a house in a shopping centre in singapore bendemeer tauscht janani amirthalinga a golden armreif , a ring and a pair of earrings , to pay the school fees of their daughters .
&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house , as is all my money , &quot; says amirthalinga .
although they deserved 3,000 singapore dollars ( 1,730 euros ) a month as an administrative assistant and her husband work , the monthly family income does not enough , she explained .
indeed , the demand in parts of south-east asia , where the indebtedness of households is growing -- so that value max , where they made their exchange this week , the third was a house , which is listed on the singapore stock exchange .
the verpfänden of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money -- 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga , but almost as good as a ungesichertes bank loans .
pfand houses in singapore typically require an annual rate of 17 percent , barely above the 15.4 % , requires the united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
pfand houses offer the advantage that no review of the credit or income qualifications are needed , why loans faster than with banks .
for this reason , millions of people in the region of pfand homes , as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and a growing budget and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans because of loose monetary policy in developed economies for lower and middle-income families in pfand houses to stotternder economy offset the difference .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing household debt , mainly by rising mortgage , as a risk factor for the credibility of asian banks .
according to the agency , malaysia , thailand and singapore have the highest household debt relative to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of gdp , an increase of 60 percent in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week just emerged from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand .
&quot; at the end of the day , this means that costs rise people in the middle to lower income segment ( the scale ) will try to supplement their income , wherever this is possible , &quot; says song seng wun , economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
historic highs in gold prices in the last two years have reinforced the trend towards verpfändung personal items , because the people the opportunity to turn the family jewellery in cash .
in singapore , about 70 % of the verpfändeten items of gold in the 200 pfand houses of the city .
people say : &quot; the price looks good , let us pledge large mutters gold chain and call back next month . &quot;
the biggest thai in its stores , a house operator , easy money , has seen a 20 % increase in clients in the last few months .
the growth in deposit business is so strong that max value , the operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 in singapore wants to expand , not only in the neighboring malaysia , where the company operates four houses , but also outside asia , yeah lee ching , director of value max .
the company financed 60 percent of the $ 66 million singapore , which this week with the ipo in singapore .
while some lenders are caught in the crossfire , said yeah because high interest rates that not only lower interest rates than other verleiher pfand homes böten , but not directly to the increased debt .
&quot; customers beleihen verschulung items that they already have , and the verflüssigen personal valuables does not increase the budget , &quot; she explained .
the pfand leihgeschäft socially increasingly accepted as a short-term , secure funding .
also , not all people who use pawn in financial difficulties .
wealthy people from singapore in the branches of value max to pawn gold and rolex watches , they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
customers come to us from every social class .
&quot; these include wohlhabende , in the short term for a business or an investment lending , small businesses , which have to overcome bottlenecks in cash flow , &quot; says yeah .

ralf rangnick so happy with the current hochform of league-table leaders red bull salzburg , so disappointed was the sports director of the &quot; bulls &quot; of the arbiters .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and alan into the category schwalbe kings , &quot; he took the two offensiv wirbler protection on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
the most recent cause of rangnicks criticism was yellow for mane in the 3-0 against grödig last sunday , the senegalese alleged schauspielerei was doomed but was not , as the tv pictures showed .
&quot; an egregious mistake , &quot; said rangnick , the referee harkam as &quot; completely overwhelmed . &quot;
harkam will also have &quot; its part &quot; to eskalation between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the game .
he defended his german country , as roger schmidt &quot; : &quot; i have the same in every situation .
schmidt wants the skirmishes with hütter have had no contact with his colleagues .
i do not know why .
&quot; because i am the one who was offended , &quot; said the 46-year-old .
in view of the success of rangnick voted but a lobeshymne .
&quot; there are only two words : good , &quot; he stated .
there is not much .
in particular , the way in which the team is impressive .
this is to continue .
kader changes in the winter transfer will be little .
there is no great reasons to make a difference .
&quot; but a player with the desire , it is clear that he wants to leave the club , &quot; said rangnick .
the british government has announced a study designed to increase the benefits of the hs 2 rail project for scotland .
it is proposed in the work of hs2 ltd , with the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 , high-speed links between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister baroness kramer said the project &quot; will bring britain closer together . &quot;
the scottish transport minister keith brown said he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
at the end of phase 2 there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june the government revised the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed line between london and the north of england of gbp 32.7 billion to gbp 42.6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , hs 2 ltd mandated to seek further route capacity and journey time improvements to northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : &quot; our goal for hs 2 is a truly national network , the united kingdom and its cities closer together . &quot;
we are proceeding with hs 2 , because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary alistair car michael commented : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland . &quot;
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown car called michael to &quot; unequivocally &quot; for the scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
brown said : &quot; the high-speed rail has the potential enormous economic benefits for scotland , at the same time , the economic strength of scotland also provides an argument for high-speed rail links across britain . &quot;
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the link between glasgow and edinburgh , the scottish government is already planning .
i look forward to the report together with the british ministers in the next year to examine and decide on the next steps .
living with future
in fact , lives a waltraud ries .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart , with a lot of green , old trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
in the city are only a few minutes by public transport .
&quot; i hope they have no fear of spiders ? &quot; asks waltraud ries and shows a fat spider on the door frame .
i have been looking for some time for a new home for my husband and me .
but you know how difficult that is in stuttgart .
the reason is not a spider phobia , but the concern , at the age no longer able to tackle the many steps to the house and in the apartment , she explains .
in addition , since the mittfünfzigerin has experienced a meniskus operation , what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor .
recently it is a book published on happy living in the age- what home form is the best for me ? &apos; .
&quot; our apartment is the best example of what the age is not &apos; , it begins to tell .
when more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment , it was simply a nice apartment in the middle of the greens .
today by mid-fifty waltraud ries thinks otherwise .
but they also know that it is one of the few people who could deal with the issue of living in the age &apos; .
most of the crowd , as long as it is .
old are only the other , &apos; she says schmunzelnd .
only when the pressure is really suffering , do we have to consider .
&quot; but it may also be too late , as ries .
in her book , the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined housing in the age .
&apos;what home form one chooses , is always an individual decision , &quot; she says .
d i e solution there is not for the age .
even those who can afford the pensions seat in tuscany or brittany , should always consider that he could be sick .
and : &quot; without a good knowledge of the language same in dolce vita , &quot; the fachbuch author aussiedlung willing to consider .
its models include classical models , alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners -wg .
in the age , everyone he ticks and quirks
&quot; for me it would be a residential community but nothing , &quot; she says with a wink .
certainly not like a student-with a common bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos; you just need also his retreat , &quot; says ries .
however , a senior living community work , the author does not want to exclude .
but that must then differently than in the traditional studenten -wg .
and sometimes if you simply want to even its calm &apos; , she believes .
with this opinion , it is in the country &apos;s capital , at least not alone .
&quot; most elderly people want to remain in their own homes as long as it is in stuttgart &apos; , is the experience of teresa rütten , the head of the civil service in the age of the provincial capital .
its service advises people around the issue &apos; Älter &apos; .
therefore , it would only accept older people often unbequemlichkeiten and restrictions in order to be able to remain in their familiar surroundings , it is also the experience of the stiftung warentest .
there are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier .
ries recommends that all the dealing with the old fair remodeling their house or apartment , first to inform thoroughly and not only the best craftsmen .
today , there is also for the old fair reconstruction specialists .
even in the rental achieve one or the other , and if it can only be the toilet seat is increasing , the interior designer .
but not always , the existing housing so old and free umgestalten , even if it is so beautiful .
this experience had waltraud ries .
you may install a stairlift within the apartment , but the area also paved way to the front door , the far greater obstacle .
they will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for themselves and their man .
before the move hate it more than the spider on their front door .

basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to underworld size neil scarborough
the lawyer had fear that its covert drug addiction could come to light
he was sentenced by the liverpool crown court to three years in prison
a well-known criminal defender , a drug baron warned of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drogensucht could be found , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , provides underworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after he was compromised by its own cocaine addiction .
the detective hailed as &quot; a lawyer , nicknamed &quot; bash , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 , after the police had overseen scarborough , which he represented in a previous drug procedures .
officials saw scarborough ( 32 ) three bags of cocaine in the house of anwalts in blackburn , lancashire , hers , was with colleagues during a meal of the bar .
the investigation revealed that ditta regularly brought the class a drugs tests , after traces of cocaine were found in his hair , his wallet and credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he unerlaubt to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of its partners .
all four suspects were part of a major investigation by the police procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
they were later arrested , along with 32 other people after a series of house searches by the police ensured heroin and cocaine worth gbp 1.5 million and gbp 200,000 in cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals , because he feared that his drug addiction can be publicised .
today , ditta , who works for the firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , at liverpool crown court and found guilty after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice .
he gave in a previous survey the cocaine possession .
the prosecutor was transferred after the police in their investigations of scarborough herausfand that this had been in regular telephone contact with ditta in february 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to dittas house and the drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove under the mülltonne anwalts .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs telefonierte scarborough regularly with ditta , which was at a dinner in the blackburn rovers at ewood park football stadium .
the lawyer returned home , the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .
in court , it became known that ditta was a &quot; regular konsument &quot; of cocaine , after tests of class a drugs were discovered in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested , but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealers , because his client is subject to the &quot; public secret , &quot; claiming their discussion .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were taken and he was ensured a hair sample .
the police interrogation , he had an office and clients betreibe both at his private address and in the workplace would call him at home for legal matters .
in court , it became known that key players in the drug trade , some of which he had represented , after significant arrests had informed and what the investigators knew about it .
prosecutor anne whyte said : &quot; a criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that we are not breaking the law . &quot;
ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he has to deal with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer , his lawyer with drugs .
one part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these individuals .
but that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was the police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue their criminal activities .
mr ditta said that his profession into disrepute .
he stood too close to certain clients , especially scarborough , and he allowed that his independence is compromised .
ditta rejected any wrongdoing and said : &quot; if i were a corrupt prosecutor , i am not , and wanted to pass on information to scarborough , then i would not wait 15 hours , but do it immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing , superintendent lee halstead of the lancashire police said : &quot; mr ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction led to a hopeless kompromittierung and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of the organised crime , which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and in the public trust and confidence .
ditta has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his work .
lancashire &apos;s serious and organised crime unit led the investigation against ditta , which led to a conviction for possession of cocaine and obstructing justice in three cases , which emphasises our determination to bring criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .
we will find you and bring you to court .
scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .
thirty- five other people were involved in drug trafficking &apos; sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .
ditta published on its website with questions and answers about an area in which he , his job is as a lawyer represented clients in the death cell in the united states to be invited to the dinner is mohammed ali and inequality is the ultimate motivation for his work .
until now , the police inspection kempten can look back on a quiet halloween night .
the officials were only twice to chips what them against house facades warfen werfenden children .
since the homeowners this early and the egg remains remote , there is no material damage .
furthermore , in the area of the city perhaps also some sylvester cavort detonated , but there is no damage .
a residents in bishop freundorfer road reported that his car with klopapier eingewickelt and radzierblenden was stolen .

the council adopted track facilities targeted
&quot; the hirschen &quot; consuming the railway crossing should be converted to improve road safety ?
yes , the local authorities have decided .
schiltach needs to 220,000 euros in the hands .
the deutsche bahn wants to improve the kinzigtal line in the coming year .
it is particularly to increase the safety of crossings are regularly to collisions of trains with other vehicles in germany .
the restructuring measures to the communities , they must agree with a third of the cost involved , the rest are rail and federal .
schiltachs city architect roland griesshaber explained to the council the nature of the bah Übergangs &quot; the hirschen . &quot;
there is the mundes west of the city , to the tune of the tunnel , to build a bulge .
there could also greater transport vehicles , for example , those long wood , in turn , without having to block the tracks .
griesshaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary stützmauer so that the city could expand the road when the time comes , to ensure a smooth traffic flow .
this has been controversial and discussed in the council , as some councils the need for road proliferation in doubt : thomas kipp brought to the mood of critics took to the point : &quot; we have so much money in the hands of so few vehicles ? &quot;
mayor thomas haas said : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; will regularly used for the transport of long timber .
even &quot; kuhbach &quot; will be transported by this route , in part , because the wood from the area up to 20 metres long vehicles could use the route to the häberles bridge , not because they could not turn in the road .
in addition , serve the route as umleitungfür those vehicles , not allowed to use the tunnel , haas argued that if the main road is blocked .
since abzusehen that kirchberg and schloss berg tunnel could be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in wolfach , the railway crossing an important transport , &quot; the &quot; hirschen &quot; for a longer period .
the council agreed to investigate the costs which would cause angedachte broaden the road .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway Übergangs was agreed with the proviso that the required majority stützmauer is built in such a way that the city may encounter for transport to the road &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; around 5.5 metres .
the renovation of the transition to the gerberei trautwein could lead to a different problem that affects the ansteigenden &quot; geroltz houses in the road . &quot;
the administration was the umbaupläne train from engineering breinlinger examined , since it had doubts as to whether the planned then the geroltz houses is still perfectly possible .
the investigation concluded that it cannot be excluded that the gradient of the road that could lead to longer vehicles aufsitzen .
the responsibility for wear in the city as road baulast winner .
the restructuring could therefore entail liability disputes .
as both the wood abfuhr and the abbiegen worked in the current state of development , argued that we should not approve the reconstruction of the rail Übergangs haas .
it is also the risk of a collision with a train car at the transition significantly lower than the other crossings , because the stopping point directly to the middle , there is a good line of sight .
even if abgebremst trains from the main train station at this point would be that no risk of collision .
the majority of this rail refuses to give its assent to the transition as the city schiltach had the problem with sitting vehicles &quot; ausbaden , räte , &quot; as the railways could withdraw after the conclusion of the work of the responsibility .
the board considered problems the umbauten the crossings &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; kuhbach , &quot; for already crossing agreements with the rail .

syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , a monitoring group
syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition gitftga , the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on thursday , while there have been serious clashes in the vicinity of the sites in the north of the country , where mutmasslich toxic substances are stored .
also on thursday , a syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago .
the announcement came a day before the date of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw )
november 1 , the organisation based in the hague damascus , to destroy all chemical weapons production facilities or to make &quot; inoperabel , &quot; including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions .
the process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable , which is aimed at the destruction of all syria &apos;s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
damascus has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies .
according to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons , including mustard gas and sarin gas in the country .
the announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the town of safira on thursday , the experts say that there is a facility for chemical weapons production and storage sites , such as the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights said .
the activist group , which has a network of activists in syria , the number of deaths , said on thursday that 120,296 people have died .
there are 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .
on the government side were 29,954 of them by the army of president bashar assad , 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
also among the dead were 2,202 desertierte army soldiers and 5,375 of opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on july 25 , the un estimated the number of people killed in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not yet been updated .
the conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .
assad &apos;s troops have been fighting against the rebels , many of whom have ties to al qaeda groups for weeks in safira .
the observatory said there had been losses on both sides on thursday , but gave no details .
the fighting underscores the risk of the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to rid syria of its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a raging civil war .
according to the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , is the team &quot; now convinced that all-important production and mixing / filling facilities , and their destruction of syria has witnessed . &quot;
therefore , &quot; are currently planned no further inspection activities . &quot;
at the beginning of the week , the inspectors declared that they have completed the first round of checks and had visited 21 of 23 sites specified by damascus .
the visit of two institutions was impossible because of security concerns , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc said the two sites have been abandoned according to the syrian statement ... &quot; and the objects of the chemical weapons programme had been transferred to other institutions mentioned , there have been inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two institutions , the opcw inspectors were not able to visit .
syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the executive committee of the opwc next month .
&quot; i salute the bravery and courage you have shown all the while fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , &quot; said ahmed uzumcu , the director-general of the monitoring organisation in a commentary published by opcw .
for three years now this civil war in the mainly sunni muslim rebels fighting assad &apos;s government and its security forces , many members of the alawites , a division of shia islam .
with regard to other developments , the head of the observation group , rami abdurrahman said , there was a strong explosion in a air defence in the syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion is not known , he said .
rbs suspended two foreign exchange dealers
the royal bank of scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit , two people familiar with the situation , this is another indication that the global regulatory investigations of alleged manipulation in the currency market to accelerate sharply .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigation into the world &apos;s largest financial market , changing hands on the $ 5.3 trillion a day .
the two dealers would be the first rbs staff were suspended in the widening investigation into the scandal surrounding the libor interbank business entails .
the bank made no comment on the suspendierungen , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .
&quot; our investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulators , &quot; said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that the rbs and the records of emails and instant messages that were sent to a former trader , forwarded to the british regulator , the financial conduct authority .
the trader , richard usher , had left the rbs 2010 and is now the european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan beurlaubt from his current position .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , beurlaubt and matt gardiner , senior currency trader at barclays and ubs earlier this week , was suspended at standard chartered this week .
none of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing .
the instant message group of usher were bankers at barclays and citigroup , people close to the situation said .
ubs announced this week that it had taken steps against some of their staff , after the swiss regulator finma said that they are investigating a suspected manipulation of foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities around the world -- the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us justice department and the hong kong monetary authority , is currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also launched investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .
banks durchkämmen instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news about these investigations to the dealers in an area in turmoil in recent years has become one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks , but this year pressure , because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid currency market , leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true .
a leading retailer said that , despite the enormous daily volume in foreign trade between the different trading platforms and the growing use of its own internal fragmentation of liquidity by banks causes that &quot; we have very low ticket prices can affect the market . &quot;
the news came on the same day , when credit suisse announced that it had terminated a dealer of london exchange traded funds offices this week , after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and working with them .
&quot; we are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained , &quot; said credit suisse .

early puberty : faster erwachsen .
african american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age genossinnen , as studies show .
physical changes mean not the puberty
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger for early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specialises in child health and family issues .
a mother should be concerned if their daughter grow breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida children medical association , said the paediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz , that these early physical change is relatively normal among american girls and represents a new standard .
&quot; i spend a lot of time to reassure parents -- usually there is no sign that the puberty occurs quickly , &quot; explained kaplowitz .
the ads of development , such as growing breasts , shame and achselhaare and body odor , with girls in the past .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the men ark ( the first menstrual period ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states the average age of 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; if the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to early puberty in girls , &quot; says kaplowitz , author of &quot; men ark often auftretenden : the essential guide to deal with this problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test , such as puberty progresses .
it is controversial , which is the beginning of puberty , but it is &quot; early ripe , &quot; if the breast augmentation accompanied by a growth in an age of eight years .
in most cases , the process is slowed down or stalled -- something that a pediatrician can closely monitor .
faster progress could be displayed by a endikronologen tests so that serious problems like tumors or cysts can be excluded .
there are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defence of another result : the premature aging of the bones , which may ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body wuchs in adults .
the recommendations for a pharmacological or hormonal therapy is based on the age of the child , the speed of development , growth and the emotional maturity .
psycho social aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious when it comes to drugs , but he admits : &quot; the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age genossinnen . &quot;
the other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period .
&quot; they are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they manage the hygienic side , &quot; kaplowitz said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls a woman whose daughter with ten their days .
although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation , she was not emotionally prepared .
she was scared and excited home from school , because it was the first in their circle of friends .
there are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
young girls are similar earlier in the puberty .
kaplowitz is of the opinion that the compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 , he supported the implementation of a study on girls aged six to nine years , the link between body fat and the entry into the puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors played a role .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age genossinnen .
there are different explanations .
global seems to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions on the climate to the genes .
another puzzle : although boys face and schambehaarung already growing , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as high as for girls .
other doctors on the aap conference highlights the complexity of the issue .
the emergence of acne and pubic hair is even in infants and young children .
&quot; we have to be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician , as they should talk with their child .
&quot; this may mean that you must carry on a conversation earlier than expected , &quot; kaplowitz advised .
if we remain quiet , the child normally reacts well .
girls , early erblühen need the insurance , the process is a normal part of life , even if it happens earlier than expected .

and later than the vocal call &quot; derby winner with anpfiff from the southern gallery is &quot; was , as always everything again .
the silence was a response to the events of the last few days .
just before the title holders at fc schalke 04 had some of the mitgereisten bvb supporters fired flares in the ranks and the place and nearly goalkeeper roman weidenfeller .

germany &apos;s biggest country church has an offensive gestartet , to promote the work of the pastor .
background is a possible shortage of priests : the evangelical lutheran church hannover currently expects that the number of around 1,800 pastor and pastors to jetziger situation will halve by 2030 .
today is the very attractive profession for young people and offer good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in consultation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to the work and to manage their daily .
with burfien , the church pastor for the first time on a full place to inspire young people for the study of theology .
currently , fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology .
burfien leads to the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is soft , the world is loud . &quot;
this is the work of great freedom and diversity .
i am mr my schedule and my priorities , where it is important to me .
pastors as pastors could be very close to the people .
they deserved as much as teachers and could live it .
certainly will have paid more , but in the free economy , a secure employer .
this brings me to the young people of today , which is not only about career , but a job .
according to the church , which includes three-quarters of lower saxony , currently around 60 pastors per year in the retirement .
at the same time , approximately 40 graduates start their vikariat of theology studies .
in sparsely populated and peripheral regions such as the resin , the emsland or the wendland can be difficult to occupy it in the future .
burfien will , among other things , hold study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the theology studies offer a broad education .
it can even be federal president .
hearing before the royal commission : two ymca staff accusations against jonathan lord accused of sex
two ymca staff from new south wales ( nsw ) have been accused of sex offences relating to children , charges against the childcare jonathan lord from caringbah before 2011 , as the royal commission for sexual abuse of children .
but the opening statement to the commission the ymca had said it had &quot; never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organisation . &quot;
ceo phillip hare has been consulted on a case in which a ymca employee was charged with child pornography offences , and another at the ymca caringbah hall 1991 a sports teacher was convicted of the abuse of children entrusted to him .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission assistierenden lawyer , knew that he had known from the first case , but not the second .
he admitted that the opening statement of the ymca to the commission was also vague in the statement , &quot; we have external reviews of the ymca , in which the ymca was recognised as at the forefront of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission show that the ymca was informed that he is the second-lowest of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( ministry of education ) in august of this year .
hare , with 21 the ymca started , admitted the management had failed &quot; from me on downwards &quot; in the recruitment of lord and not ensured that staff were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety .
lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two years for the ymca at the beginning of the year .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare argued , however , that the ymca had a cultural problem , the employees have held lords violations in relation to the safety of children .
the employees said they had observed violations , among other things , that lord was alone with children , for private as a babysitter , they have a said that he would like to sit on his lap , and let children play with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , whose leader lord was and had asked for a training on child protection , because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the children of the supervisors in ymca caringbah , jacqui barnat , the lords was &quot; very intimidating and most of the time was very remote . &quot;
the ceo said he would not accept statements by employees that they have not had the courage to report back to their superiors .
instead , he said , but their friendship with lord have impaired their judgment why they had not reported him .
hare said that he was the chairman of the ymca nsw , the organisation shared his view that the lesson to be drawn from the jonathan lord incident , &quot; &quot; not the melden &quot; by staff betreffe , and the board voted in favour .
hare said that the decision to push the staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations had been made by the director of children &apos;s services , liam whitley , ymca .
he said that it should prevent contamination of the evidence , but had been &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw is in the period between 2009 and 2011 , when jonathan lord was employed , not for children safe organisation , said professor stephen small bone of griffith university , an expert on child sex abuse of the commission .
he explained that there are &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , screening , training , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing was postponed until december 20 .
tourism : descend to the romans
cologne is around 120 metres below a water from the roman times .
visiting cologne , the cathedral .
approximately 157 metres from the two towers in the sky , making it the second-highest church building of europe .
but only a few visitors , the two filigranen kirchtürme bestaunen anticipated that there is a lot to discover in the cathedral .
rainer schulze is an expert in cologne pit .
meeting place for tourism directly on its tours is the centre of cologne cathedral .
the tour starts very unspectacular beginnings : &quot; we are in the garage , &quot; says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a fair city , and therefore only what remained of the remains of the old city wall was not too great .
most of the users of the park house , therefore , today the roman over and only your car .
but if you look more closely , discovered in the parking d 2 an archaeological site separated by metal bars .
there are about five meters high ruins of handteller large stones .
&quot; there are remains of the roman city wall , built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; says schulze .
before it goes back to light , schulze participants on the upper park level leaves a look in a dark , 15-meter shaft .
this is the fountain of the old cathedral , which , unfortunately , unnoticed .
the next step of the prätorium , and there the participants back down into the depths .
we see the office of the most powerful man north of the alps , the prätors of the ccaa .
what ccaa means , a visitor would like to know .
&quot; it stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium , &quot; which in roman law as much as &quot; town and city of agrippinenser , founded by emperor claudius on the place of the altar for the kaiser cult &quot; means . &quot;
and the prätorium is the former statthalter palace , the power center of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the lobby of the exhibition introduces a tunnel access to the roman sewer of around 120 metres .
&quot; you can go one step along the so-called cloaca maxima along , if you want , &quot; schulze the guests .
a surprise schulze has .
he has brought to the cashier key , he leads the group to a 16-meter begehbaren shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikvah , a jewish ritual bath , &quot; he says .
the jewish community built their bath deep in the soil to the groundwater , which was essential for ritual ablution .
to date , in the bottom of the mikvah , whose origins go back to the eighth century , different water levels by changing the level of the rhine brushstrokes .
the mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for the work should begin shortly .
until the completion but a few years .

george kerevan : european unbundling gives scots the choice
a new day , a new horror story for independence .
this time , we warned that an independent scotland would be required to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this provides the cue for stories about passport controls in berwick and a gesicherte with barbed wire border of hadrian &apos;s wall .
in fact , in the strathclyde document on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of europe , but this is -- predictably -- played no role in the news .
nobody has also mentioned that the eu member states often bent their strict rules when it is convenient for them .
however , scotland is not part of the schengen area , the continued failure to brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the scots .
so , no story .
and one that has been so in the years that they have a fossil : the first time i heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; duck at least 40 years ago .
this is an interesting point in the permanent wiederholen of this ancient history .
why should we expect an independent scotland that after the european pipe dances ?
why the london eintauschen against the yoke of brussels , especially now ?
that is the real european news : the big , broader plan to reunify europe after the war is stalled .
with the euro crisis is the european project is officially dead .
the anti-eu parties are gaining ground everywhere in the eu or the euro as single currency want to throw overboard .
even in germany , the eurosceptic alternative for germany party , only founded this year -- nearly five million votes in the general election in september for ergattern and effectively the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) from the bundestag .
there have been local opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis is a turning point .
because of the strict austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank in connection with the straitjacket , the national economy by adhering to the single currency to europe , many people are of the opinion that the project is too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits -- that was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has festgenagelt its members on exchange rates , which are beneficial for german exporters -- and german politicians would like .
without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency found southern europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage germany .
the only possibility is to reduce wages and public spending -- spurred by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems is a deeper european productivity problem .
as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy directives imposed by brussels -- a code for subsidising french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers , the european industry compared with the united states pays double for electricity and four for gas .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen in grangemouth .
all wage fixing the world to protect the european petrochemical industry from cheap american shale gas in the corner .
as a result , a revolt , particularly in france , the former cheerleaders of the eu .
after the war , france &apos;s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to germany to keep in check and paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin and paris no longer needed as a gateway to political legitimacy struggling aufgedrückt , the ailing french economy , europe has its own economic policy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , anti-eu national front has just won a decisive nachwahl and that the ruling socialists at three .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 percent of the vote -- a timely warning for the british labour party that it cannot assume a split in the right-wing would mean benefits for the left .
what makes le pen with their newly gained popularity among white working-class people ?
they would like to use the european elections next year , to forge an anti-eu , anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties do well in these elections -- and this is perfectly possible , then such a block dominated by the european parliament for the first time .
this is the point that i want to emphasise that , in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the eu and the single currency on the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be something like the &quot; europe of ( sovereign ) nations , &quot; the general de gaulle favored .
germany and some of its satellite economies , perhaps the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect that britain distanced themselves from this project in the hope to curry favor with the us .
however , washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific suggests that britain alone in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to be a small region by ( ultimately ) england .
or we can defend our own economic interests , including , berlin and brussels to say what they where stuck .
i suspect that scotland could drive in a lockereren european network very well , if we keep our own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries is in a europe of nations not föderierten easier .
otherwise , we should consider it join norway and retain our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is -- remarkably -- the most successful political movement against austerity measures in europe and a spectacular majority in 2011 as a result of the rejection of the proposed ( and won ) cuts , the labour chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling and the tory-lib dem coalition had to answer .
it would be ridiculous to decide now for independence for scotland , only to get a austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices on planes ( but no phone conversations )
from takeoff to landing , passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , listen to music and the image of films , but not with mobile phones , the new guidelines , issued on thursday by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in the united states .
but the passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately .
how quickly they were implemented , would depend on the respective airline , faa employee michael huerta said at a press conference .
the faa , the airlines must prove that they comply with the new directives and that the training manuals of the flight crew and planes have updated the rules for the verstauen equipment under the new rules .
the faa said it received a number of airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
under these airlines , delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the faa announced in a statement .
passengers currently have smartphones , tablets and other devices off , when the plane doors are closed .
they must restart only when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .
passengers must enter the approach you again and they must not restart before the plane landed .
under the new guidelines could allow airlines whose aircraft against electronic disturbances are secured their passengers to use the devices in starting and landing on the tarmac , the faa said .
most new transport aircraft and other planes , which were umgerüstet , should meet the criteria for the use of wi-fi in greater heights .
laura glading , president of the association of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new regulation is implemented safely , and we are working closely with the airline on this , both sides will benefit , &quot; said glading .
we are frankly tired , to feel as aufpasser on this issue .
however , internet surfing , exchange of emails , text messages or downloading of data , banned under three kilometres to the authority .
passengers are invited to smartphones , tablets and other devices in the air mode .
so there is still no &quot; words with friends , the scrabble ähnelnde online game , played the actor alec baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of high profile american airlines because he refused to shut down the device , while the aircraft was parked flugsteig .
heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored , because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned .
the regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not the faa .
faa highlights may ban on certain electronic devices for starting and landing
last month , said mark rosenker of transport safety authority national transportation safety board , an expert on national security issues at cbs news , mobile phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; mobile phones are a problem , not only because it could potentially cause interference with navigation devices , but because we know from the fcc that the transfer from the air sendemasten can interfere , &quot; said rosenker .
an advisory committee of the industry , which was launched by the faa to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government permit a wider use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years has increased the pressure on the faa to loosen restrictions on the use .
critics such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill from missouri take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous .
there is talk in some studies , up to a third of the passengers the closure of the device forgotten or ignored .
the faa began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers mitgeführte fm radios became known , then the trend represents the latest technology .
new planes are more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the faa to electronic interference .
airlines offer passengers wi-fi some years ago , when the flight height is reached .
the wi-fi systems adapted pilots are also less susceptible to interference .
the vast majority of passenger planes should be appropriate for the greater use of electronic devices to the new guidelines , huerta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices in general much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-reader , for example , only minimal radiation , if you umblättert .
but when downloading or sending of data transfer values are more .
one of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers amazon.com .
in 2011 companies invited staff of kindle e-reader and a passenger plane made a testflug , in order to identify problems , but could not see .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed feelings with regard to the risk of the use of equipment .
douglas kidd from the national association of airline passengers , said he was of the opinion that the passengers disrupted by the equipment is genuine , even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said , there are only isolated reports of pilots for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the equipment , and most of them are very old .
however , the committee recommended the faa to allow pilots instruments landing in low visibility the closure of the devices by the passengers .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes , describing them as a reasonable accommodation for travellers , today extensively equipped with technology .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa acknowledges that a passenger experience is not contrary to the security , &quot; said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .

gechingen : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the residents in the planning , &quot; mayor jens häussler opened the public information event on flood protection concept in gechingen .
around 80 participants in the town hall , in order to explain the planned actions , questions , concerns and ideas .
häussler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions of the members of the council . &quot;
the hochwasser gechingen on may 15 , 2009 , have been caught unprepared , is a einschneidendes event , which raised the question of protection for the future , häussler .
a river survey was commissioned with the neighbouring village of aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection scheme in gechingen .
&quot; the protection of maximum number of cultivated land is the goal , &quot; says häussler .
the planning is based on the expected flood protection according to the german weather service statistics every 100 years .
the climate change will be taken into account through a 15 % supplement .
in expert circles , with &quot; hq 100aklima . &quot;
the water , which had caused considerable damage in gechingen in 2009 , with a 1000-year flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , &quot; says häussler .
in order to achieve the protection hq 100aklima gechingen must be invested around eur four million , the municipality can count on country grants amounting to around 70 percent .
häussler , but pointed out that the promotion is only when an overall concept .
this is the community dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a aufwändiges planning and authorisation procedures must be completed .
in the best case could be 2016 started with the implementation .
among other things , the protection scheme , which has already been presented in the council last week ( we reported ) local measures in the flow of flüsschens award from stammheimer valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept took the participants the opportunity to present their concerns .
among other things , called into question , why are not more dams and reservoirs to protect the site .
gregor kühn , specialist planners from the engineering responsible forest and corbe home , presented the concept , stressed that the interaction of all the measures needed in order to achieve the desired objective in the sum .
in addition , it is to find the most economical solution , joachim forest and forest corbe .
unmut was in the taxis of the old town , even in the normal storm rain have always suffered a congestion of the channel network .
the problem is in the administration and the first steps have been taken .
häussler pointed out , however , that the guidelines for channel systems other than for flood protection and this should not be mixed .
the community was obliged to interpret the channel network so that two-to three-year rain events verkraftet .
the sewers to larger dimensions , would absorb millions .
the new opschlag shines with a new cafe .
one , the hotel and wiederkommen .
one , the name of the programme .
according to the dictionary , déjà vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon that reflected in the feeling , to have seen before or a new situation .
in the case of the visit of the cafés on opschlag in the district town of kleve in sight distance to university rhine-waal is not in the pure sense of a déjà vu .
finally , the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the aim : to make a real stay not only gedanklich , but hand always wiederkehrend experience .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful .
a look into the interior at the opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling .
the modern , but not cool cafe environment looks like a place to relax .
here , the team with the gründern mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top of the guest with different types of coffee or cocktail .
it &apos;s delicious cakes or individually-sourced fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name before the opening of the schmucken cafés on opschlag as art : in kranenburg , the &quot; art lounge . &quot;
the move to kleve on opschlag hope the café lovers more sympathetic audience .
last but not least , by the university .
&quot; and we do not have a specific target , &quot; said daniel büttner .
we would like to raise the two young students here just as seniors and all ages in between .
speaking of coffee-lovers .
the likeable owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment .
enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the various forms .
expressofan
daniel büttner is expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt the cappuccino trinkerin .
&quot; a baguette- that is my thing , &quot; she tells the nrz .
two events there &apos;s even in the bright cafe .
better said one .

jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of major orders over seat width
it is between leading aircraft manufacturers to a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights , which set the tone for a bitter clash at the dubai air show this month .
the dispute revolves around the seat width , offered the passengers on long flights in economy class -- not always those who seek most airlines , but this area is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest planes from boeing co. and airbus sas .
airbus this week called for an industry standard , which requires a minimum seat width of 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us erzrivale boeing says airlines should decide .
the debate comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer competing to sell more versions of their zweimotorigen long-haul flights , and from 17 to 21 november record orders at the event .
as the rear of the aircraft is developed , particularly if there are rows with nine or ten seats , is crucial for the economic results , the new &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; design intended to provide .
boeing claims its modernised &quot; 777x &quot; fasse 406 passenger seats in economy class , about 17 inches wide and so allow 10 per number .
airbus said that the competing version of the a 350 implies 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class , there are nine per number .
plane giants often share hiebe on technical details by advertising in the press .
now appelliert airbus before the dubai air show , where the 777x is expected to make the race , with over 100 orders directly to the public .
the company recently presented a display before the beginning of a new war could sit and donors showed a picture in which three people squeezed in a restaurant , and the title : &quot; would you accept that ? &quot;
&quot; boeing proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo props , &quot; says airbus sales chief john leahy .
given changed eating habits , people are thick , but not plane seats have changed radically .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the average american male has increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to data from the us department of health .
the average waist size of the male amerikaners in the 21st century , according to us health statistics 100.8 cm .
airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s , was narrower than the average body size of the newly christened &quot; jet set . &quot;
airbus , that we have carried out research which showed that one additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat , sleep quality by 53 % increase .
boeing disputes the figures from airbus to the seat and says that it is not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines the balance between air fares and furnishings .
the company also explains , according to research the experience in aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat .
&quot; it really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful , &quot; says the flight of boeing &apos;s cabin expert kent craver .
they do not want to dictate them , what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , it is more elbow for manufacturers , but it is increasingly an issue that can affect the sales .
the debate is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a major impact on the export performance of the us or europe .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets .
both airbus and boeing say 20 percent more efficient per seat in its latest zweimotorigen long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater boeing 77-300er .
the boeing &apos;s statements on the results depend partly on the 777x , with its ten seats per row , compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased per unit costs are still lower than currently used machines with 10 seats per row .
&quot; boeing quetscht more seats in his plane , to make it more competitive with our products , &quot; says kevin keniston , airbus &apos; head of passenger comfort in europe .
on the other hand , analysts , full cabins with 10 seats per number of the existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided to closer arrangement , which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares .
&quot; eighteen inches seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is , from an economic point of view , the airbus offer from the threat , &quot; says mary kirby , controlled by the 777 expert for cabin , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing do not provide seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which airlines can select .
jet sellers have even band of travelling the world , to the establishment of competition nachzumessen .
even if they offer all the comfort anpreisen , manufacturers jets with high verdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
an airbus a 350 with 10-seat rows , but say has not yet sold .
until recently , aircraft stressed the importance of more anpassbarkeit of cabins and for some wide seats in the corridors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets will probably fizzle , but experts say that the call for a new industry standard by the wave of 777x could divert sales .
the veganismus is according to lexika vegetarismus , but differs from this in a very significant way .
although , the consumption of sahnetorte , ice or a edam , a veganers , these feasts are not on the menu .
the vegan milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish from all consumption of animal products-including honey is denied .
what , you may ask , but a closer look at the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; brotaufstriche are very popular , &quot; says ute henkel , the owner of the reform house , a wide range of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also visited the shop in the city street .
he lived for 13 years , the native neuseeländer vegan in lampertheim is ( almost ) everything , my food and what it needs to life . &quot; 1997 , i became a vegetarian . &quot;
at the turn of the century came the next step and i was vegan .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of the food , but because of the normal leather shoe choice , &quot; says proctor , the art vorzieht .
he realized that there is in other everyday matters without animal products .
first and foremost , be vegan is a ethics .
&quot; i do not want animals for me to die , &quot; says proctor , the maxim of vegans , which covers the entire consumption .
instead of burgers , scrambled eggs or rubber bears behind herzutrauern , have the vegans quickly discover new products , the enthusiasm increased .
&quot; there is a double bonus , &quot; proctor says , &quot; indeed , no surrender , no be vegan asceticism , but it is an asset . &quot; the assumption that the food conversion selection of dining options reduziere , proctor more on the power of habit .
and these conditions , even some well-intentioned attempt fail .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor that leaves many swiftly abandon , like smoking , &quot; proctor a comparison .
and is a &quot; certain tastes are not on the animal . &quot;
often it is the spices or the type of preparation , the taste .
&quot; but we can also produce the same effect in other ways , &quot; verdeutlicht the vegans .
for example , a grillfest proctor aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegan würste .
he respects on a balanced diets , it should even taste dishes .
of course , we want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it is a taste , but it is not only to reduce animal food , &quot; says proctor .
health to eating disorders , a more widespread assumption that he had not suffered .
for me , the conversion has had a positive aspect .
i am not foreign cholesterol and have a high vitamin content .
there are high-performance athletes , the exclusively vegan diets .
&quot; my blood values are well , i often check , &quot; he proctor .
in particular , many vegansimus critics warn the lack of vitamin b 12 .
&quot; as animals fed with feed , instead of pasture to graze in the meat that you buy in the freezer , it is questionable whether the amount of vitamin b 12 is high , &quot; proctor .
for vegans , there is also the possibility to get the coenzym in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b 12 values are in order , &quot; he says .
long distances should not proctor for food procurement .
finally , there are staple foods and every super market has soya milk and other products .
everything i need , i find on the ground .
only now and i buy something .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but it is also known for &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products . &quot;
in any case , the veganer recipes much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the restaurant , with a few small kniffen can be good , if not better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , baking powder and more carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , proctor and his parents-in-law .
family celebrations gives the vegan a new würze .
this dynamic , if boiling , has a new value .
&quot; the situations that may arise , are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he was also expressed scepticism .
my food tastes you no longer ?
&quot; should i feel bad because i drink milk ? &quot; act with sensitivity in such issues should be as vegans .
&quot; i do not reject the people , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor no enclave lives .
and then looked at the everyday world appears not as vegan alien as suspects and the vegans not as restricted as is commonly believed in everyday life .
fast food is allowed .
chips are everywhere !
&quot; many kebab stores offer falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , &quot; proctor says .
in a pizzeria , he ordered on pasta or a pizza without cheese , it is a question of habit .
the restaurants are so slowly it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago , i was vegan to feed , everything much more difficult , &quot; the new zealanders identify a development : &quot; you must talk to the people , they can draw attention to this . &quot;
&quot; perhaps if enough demand , they are inclined to complement the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegan restaurants , such as the kombüse in mannheim or the bird free .
proctor is the desire that other restaurants have at least a veganes dish on the menu .
basically , are vegan dishes for everyone .
everyone can eat , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusively , in the truest sense of the word , because they preclude others , &quot; said proctor .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veganismus is a safer way to make the most impossible from the outset , &quot; says proctor .
the shopping veganer products could be a bit difficult at first .
if you learn to understand , in the erdnüsse tierische additives as color donors can contain its seems to comply with the ethics of so many hurdles and traps the courage to leave quickly .
not only reuben proctor and lars thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo-animal ingredients and their alternatives , &quot; explains the many ingredients , the food but also detergents beigesetzt .
&quot; gradually developed a scanner view and signs and logos to know what we have to ensure &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps to stop or stumble , &quot; knows proctor .
the veganismus , he is an important clue to the moral consciousness .
perhaps it is not that its common ablegt , but at least he can teach the consumers , critical look at his practice .
bavaria &apos;s player despite first defeat optimistic
even the first defeat in the euroleague could not diminish the player of fc bayern munich the huge optimism .
&quot; nobody can forbid us to believe that winning , even against the best team in europe over the last two years , &quot; assessed bayern coach svetislav pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on thursday evening at defending champion olympiakos piraeus .
we have sent the message : also exists in munich basketball !
in only their third appearance in the european premier sold the munich well , the crucial stages but simply not clear enough for a very long time .
the guests created the kunststück , a 15-point piraeus final into a leadership behind 13 minutes before the game was a turning point again .
&quot; we have incredibly fought back against the two euroleague champion , but then careless mistakes , &quot; said bayern-professional yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .

new anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure smoking
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine , which could spoil the fun smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime smoking .
further tests are needed before testing on humans , which may take a few years , but professor ronald crystal from weill cornell medical college in new york , said the first results are good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but had discovered that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , &quot; says cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus , has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies .
the virus selective the liver cells , which produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibody hunt and neutralize the nicotine molecules in the blood , before they reach the brain , which a smoker no nicotine high .
in experiments behielten vaccinated mice , which have been fed nikotin , their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , by contrast , had a &quot; break , &quot; the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine reached their brains .
the experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
former tobacco vaccines failed because they contain antibodies .
the vaccination had to maintain the anti-body so often that they were expensive and impractical .
but the costs of the new vaccine are likely to significantly lower , because it transforms liver cells in anti-body factories .
as professor crystal said , could be a future vaccine for people , if he certainly children , before they were tempted to try a cigarette , and thus prevent nicotine addiction .
but it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .
&quot; they know they feel : when they start to smoke again , no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and this helps them to the habit , &quot; he explained .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but at the same time , it warned that further research is needed .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot offers exceptional production equipment and contemporary details , but also more food than is necessary .

egypt first freely elected president sworn
mohamed morsi sets the amtseid , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in egypt .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; as he was sworn in as the country &apos;s first freely elected president and the succession of hosni mubarak , was driven from office 16 months ago .
with his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi also became the arab world &apos;s first freely elected islamist president and egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he took the oath before the 18 judges of the court , which has its headquarters on the nile and dressed in black robes is based on an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we seek a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; morsi said at the ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life -- absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said the 60-year-old morsi , a u.s.-trained engineer and member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group , since its inception 84 years ago a banned organisation had been severely targeted by the government .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court , to the new president zuzujubeln , and , unlike the presidential pomp of the mubarak era , the traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually busy road linking the city centre with the southern suburbs .
derided as the brotherhood &apos;s uncharismatic &quot; spare tire , &quot; his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a friday speech , when he presented itself not only as a candidate of the islamists , but all those who wanted to bring to the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian mubarak goal .
&quot; egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; morsi said in a blue suit with a red tie dress the judges in the panelled chamber in which he amtseid ablegte .
later , morsi went to the university of cairo , where his inaugural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem , which he zuhörte on eight possessions .
the military leader field marshal hussein tantawi was present .
on his arrival , he was of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university of sprechchören of &quot; the army and the people are one hand . &quot;
the university of cairo , built in 1908 as a bastion secular education has become a stronghold of islamist student groups in the 1970s .
morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in tahir square , the birthplace of the uprising that ended mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers , the militärrat gejagten from office by the head of state .
but , with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual , before parliament , it is the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
morsi &apos;s speech in tahir square was filled with dramatic populist gestures .

frontier airlines collects charges for hand luggage
frontier airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 of verstauen on their flight hand luggage .
frontier airlines intends to charge $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if read in the announcement on wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box .
the new charge applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment on the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
frontier berechne stated that , if the fee shall be paid in advance , $ 25 and $ 100 for travelers who paid only on flugsteig .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos;malley said the fee of $ 100 , which aims to move travellers in the run-up to the payment .
&quot; we do not want to calculate this amount , &quot; she said .
airlines began to demand for the first and second checked bag fees in 2008 .
passengers who tried to bypass have therefore plugged into hand luggage as much as possible , which means that the baggage compartments above the seats are often crowded .
fees are a way to persuade passengers , less on board .
o &apos;malley said the new fee is not really about money .
the most loyal customers of frontier , have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist on the seat .
passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website , do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the flight climb of frontier circumstances can take a bag for free , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a similar bag .
o &apos;malley said frontier &apos;s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers are informed about the fee , before they come to flugsteig .
the new handgepäck fee of frontier will only come into force in the summer , there is not a precise date .
passengers often calling on baggage fees and other charges , but airlines resort to .
they argue that the cost of baggage money and passengers should pay this service , if they wanted it .
many on wall street view the new luggage fees as a sign that the airlines enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
the most so far , however , the fingers of charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc. three years ago first demanded and also followed allegiant air , a low-cost airlines for baggage charges .
the only other airline with such a fee was the hungarian wizz air , the airline consultant jay sorensen , said the additional charges closely .
he estimated in a report in december 2011 , that the handgepäck fee spirit einbringe usd 50 million a year .
sorensen , who formerly held a leadership position in midwest airlines , has recently flown with spirit and was curious what he would expect flugsteig , when passengers were faced with the unusual handgepäck fee of the company .
&quot; the boarding process is one of the most smoothly , which i have seen in my career in the aviation , &quot; he said .
i expected to see gnashing and handgreifliche discussions on flugsteig .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and the boarding ran as lubricated . &quot;
frontier is spirit in the $ 2 , the demand for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice , kept the whole box and coffee gratis will recall .
water is still free of charge .
us airways 2008 kurzzeitig attempted to demand money for soft drinks , but this was back seven months later , after passengers had complained and no major society nachgezogen .
frontiers step to levy charges for hand luggage , if passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative , with the customers on the website .
airlines pay online travel agencies like orbitz 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .
this provides an incentive for all societies , passengers to purchase directly from them , rather than through an online travel agency .
frontier is in this area , however , has gone furthest .
in september , the company started booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday , the miles were again reduced to 25 % of the flight .
a third flight booked with frontier over 1,000 miles brings customers only 250 miles .
passengers can also exclusively reserve the direct purchase on the website of frontier jobs .
frontier has a loyal customer base of his seat in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .
the revenue declined 9 percent and the flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter , as we read in the financial report is published on wednesday by the parent company , republic airways holdings inc ..
republic has tried to get to grips with the finances of frontier in the framework of the sale of the society .

the president is determined to create clarity , and makes a thorough investigation , so that no one must feel that this is abuse .
i can assure you that does not affect the rights of innocent people in this process .
kerry , however , insisted that the nsa is a force for good and many lives were saved by its monitoring operations .
he added : &quot; we have to do it with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves in the air . &quot;
there is a radical extremism in the world , the intent to kill people to blow up in the air and governments to attack .
what , if you would be able to intercept and stop , before it happens ?
indeed , we have plane crashes , prevent attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have seen in the run-up to such plans .
meanwhile , us lawmakers will travel to europe , to allay the concerns about the alleged us spying and to convince europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the united states , with the anti-terrorist efforts , as the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs said on thursday .
senator chris murphy of connecticut , said he had spoken with representatives of the european parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats , because of frustration over the national security agency surveillance not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations .
&quot; it is very important for the national security interests of the united states , that the europeans remain on board in terms of our common struggle against terrorism , &quot; said murphy , is the first democrat in the senate and as chairman of the senate subcommittee on foreign relations and european affairs , in an interview in washington .
moreover , i am going to europe , to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the nsa programs .
media reports that the nsa has collected millions of phone data in europe , which have strained relations with some us allies , although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports are incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata , which had been collected by nato allies and shared with the united states .
other revelations from snowden passed documents cited that the nsa monitored the phone of german chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other world leaders .
the director of national intelligence , james clapper , defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that it is common on both sides .
in all the commotion , murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the congress , to be held this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members to be published in the next few days .
he said that the exact route will be drawn up .
murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve the relations , he also said that there would be some &quot; serious words . &quot;
he said that the european governments should be honest with their populations about the kinds of spy programmes , which they themselves for years .
&quot; we can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of europeans , but this must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones , the spy , &quot; says murphy .
meanwhile , john kerry stands for a trip to the middle east and poland this weekend , with the anger about the us strategy in syria , egypt and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

clive palmer says prime minister tony abbott had a conflict of interest with parental leave
the members and billionaire clive palmer says prime minister tony abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters pregnant and could benefit from it .
the mining magnate , who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , the claim that when he brushed aside questions whether he would be involved in a conflict .
the palmer united party could monitor up to four votes in the senate , which is important for the decision , whether withdrawn or cut back the carbon and mining taxes .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of abbott personally would benefit from the laws .
&quot; he is in a huge conflict of interest , when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters gets pregnant , he has a direct interest , whether they leave or not , &quot; palmer said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission said palmer ahead by 53 votes after the recount officially the winner of the sunshine coast seat of fairfax .
palmer called for a review of the process of counting to go faster .
tony abbott &apos;s daughters frances and bridget .
these elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why should we not have a system in which you choose in marches immediately enter the data into a computer , and then at 6 : 30 in the evening the outcome ?
palmer also criticised the use of pencils in marking the ballot .
if you use it , because the results ausradieren , if they a do not like ?
today , with pencils is unbelievable .
the electoral commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a common legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , said that an inter-national airport for the sunshine coast belong to its policy and that he will take his new position &quot; very seriously . &quot;
in a public office is about the service to the public .
&quot; we seek no reward out of history , namely that we can serve a critical time in this community , &quot; he said .
esa determines large space missions : missions for billions
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes experts of the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .
30 proposals were to selection , five are still in the race .
distant worlds .
more than 1,000 planets of other stars , astronomers have already found .
if there is at least some of them life , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : we should search for gravitational waves ?
or explore the origins of the cosmos ?
or after discovering erdähnlichen planets fahnden and perhaps alien life ?
these questions are the responsibility of the european space agency esa .
for its program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; looking for ideas for two major space projects , which promote the research .
the budget for such &quot; l mission &quot; is approximately eur 1 billion .
the launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of september , the european space research , the elite met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were debated , five of them are now in the shortlist .
a number of bodies on the proposals , hooks the researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision by the scientific programme committee .
four major issues , the esa has selected the mission of the 2007 initiierten programme &quot; cosmic vision &quot; answers .
what are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
the exact processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds and the formation of planets that orbit stars-are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
and if a star has planets , under what circumstances can live there ?
to pursue this issue , &quot; his &quot; space telescope to 2017 , with 500 already known planetary systems in our surroundings be investigated .
but the possibilities are limited , his is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments could astronomen erdähnliche planets and even the composition of atmospheres and search for &quot; biomarkern &quot; as an indicator for biological activity : gases .
how does the solar system ?
this question is ultimately about what are the conditions for the emergence of life .
an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation posed by him with the planetary system .
in our solar system , these transactions exemplary .
the solar orbiter &quot; the esa has already sent a mission of the m-class ( there , the budget is around half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe will start 2017 and surface and activity of the sun closely .
of great interest to the researchers are jupiter and its moons .
they want to find out what role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system .
this is the , the first of the three l-mission of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its journey expected to 2022 .
eight years later , she reached jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons europa , ganymede and kallisto .
what are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid .
perhaps there are derogations , the physicists could point the way to a new theory , under whose roof all known laws of nature .
what is the universe , and what is it ?
our universe in the big bang 13.7 billion years ago .
in addition to the us geläufigen from the stars , planets and life as we know , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together , and dark energy , by actions to accelerate the expansion of space .
so far , the researchers do not know what physical laws valid in the first a split second of urknalls were what dark matter and dark energy .
&quot; euclid , &quot; the esa has already approved a m mission , whose launch is scheduled for 2020 .
with a special telescope to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process .
many experts believe the best chances of approval as l-mission &quot; e-lisa , &quot; an ambitious approach for the detection of gravitational waves .
physicists are changes in the structure of space-time , the albert einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not yet been proven .
elisa could create , the scientists behind the project hope .
the mission provides a detector , stationed in the space of two or three probes .
it could also prove gravitational waves , unlike plants on the earth , the big bang , and new knowledge about the formation of the universe .
four other competing proposals to the second l mission : a large x-ray telescope , called &quot; athena , &quot; which , among other things , to explore black holes , &quot; icy planets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; prism , &quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; exoplanet finder &quot; to identify and investigate erdähnliche planets .
ausgeschieden already include proposals on samples returning from the moon , venus and mars , to explore asteroids and the solar physics .
cdc publish allergy guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) issued a series of guidelines for the treatment of children with food allergies in schools .
these are the first such directives issued by the us government , as the number of school children with food allergies .
one in 20 children in the united states has a food allergy .
according to the cdc , the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools , the faculty and staff to raise awareness about food allergies and how to deal with children who show an allergic reaction .
it is also recommended that schools have stock epinephrin -- the car injection of the epipen brand is most commonly used , in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can hold epinephrin easier .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms , the children , have an allergic reaction .
children may say : &quot; it feels as if something on my tongue , &quot; is my tongue feels as if a hair is &quot; or &quot; my tongue kribbelt . &quot;
firefighters called to rescue a hündchens , 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry that sat
cockerspaniel bitch ruby was a minor traffic accident that went
three days later , she was discovered by a spaziergänger quarry in its predicament
firefighters seilten to face and saved the dog from sure death
the firefighters managed to bring a dog in safety , firmly sat on a 15-meter-high ledge in a temple .
the nine-month-old cockerspaniel dog went that ruby was following a road accident on sunday afternoon and survived three days alone , before it was rescued from a quarry on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend , becky hall , 20 , which includes the dog , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire , to ruby receiving and the firefighters of the west yorkshire fire and rescue service .
they were desperately searching for their missing dog and hilferufe in social networks , when she was following the small road accident in the quarry crowd .
some saw a spaziergänger about 2 : 15 on wednesday , said his dog , ruby stranded on the 15 metre ) in the quarry .
the technical rescue team rushed to the cleckheaton fire station and seilte to rescue ruby , who then was transported in a hundebox upwards .
andy clayton , a specialist technical rescue team , said : &quot; it was in a dangerous situation .
it was in the middle of the temple -- 15 metres from the top and the bottom .
they moved no muscle during their rescue -- it was as stiff frozen .
but now it is good .
then she has eaten a few dogs cake .
this was a very unusual use .
the fact that the dog was discovered , is unbelievable .
peter lau , a specialist technical rescue teams , said : &quot; ruby had a huge fortune . &quot;
there was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse .
ruby was brought to the vet to investigate , but found nothing more than exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : &quot; in the rescue was watching frightening . &quot;
i could not believe that it was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the vet said that if the exhaustion become too large and they collapsed , it would probably abgestürzt .
the firefighters have done a splendid job .
it was really courageous , what they have done .
we are so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keighley added : &quot; we were afraid that it would fall , but they remained up . &quot;
the firefighters were great .
i can hardly believe , where it was .
u.s. border : &quot; super &quot; for drug smuggling tunnel discovered
on the border between mexico and the us investigators have discovered a &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling and shut down .
as the us customs authorities , the more than 500 metre long tube between tijuana and san diego with electricity , rail and air-conditioning .
three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and confiscated nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine .
the tunnel was according to the data , not yet in use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they can ride roughshod under the radar by digging , &quot; said the general prosecutor of the us distrikts southern california , laura duffy , in a press conference in a warehouse in san diego , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .
addressing the drug gangs assured duffy : &quot; if you continue to build tunnels and tried to use it , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a perpetual fight against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , in mexico , more than 77,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug crime .
designed by experts
because of the budget of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .
the track layout was so equipped that electrically powered cars could be used .
on the mexican side , the access in a building that is 80 metres away from the border .
according to authorities , a head 20 metres in the depth of the tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 cm width .
it would have been appropriate to promote the illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was because of the confiscated marijuana .
all three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , officials said .
since 2006 were eight such tunnels have been discovered , said at the press conference in san diego .
but it is the first time that such a tunnelbau cocaine was found .
normally , smuggled cocaine in small quantities and not through tunnels .
this show the &quot; despair &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said bill sherman of the fahndung dea in san diego .
they would do everything to get in the united states .
the detainees were given no details , at least one mexicans , they said .
they must face imprisonment of up to ten years .
obama &apos;s rückzieher in the health policy
after intense criticism backtracking president obama yesterday in his oft-repeated promise is clear : &quot; if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a termination letter , the republican president in the last few days , he had misled the american public .
yesterday obama puts his original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance , they can keep , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the kündigungen obama called for those americans who have received such communications , to look for a new insurance on the open market .
most citizens could thus receive a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast .
&quot; they are a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government called it a little surprising that the 5 % of the population have insurance to look for another fare , as the treaty does not meet the new standards under the affordable care act entspreche .
&quot; i would like to say very directly to these americans : you deserve better , &quot; sebelius said at a hearing before the house energy and commerce committee in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care act , said that the launch of the online platform since october was &quot; pathetic . &quot;
&quot; i am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , &quot; she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
this is a raised sebelius to a sitting behind yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives consultant was taken after a dispute with republican legislators billy long of missouri. it was whether they should be obliged to participate in obamacare .
after more than three hours hearing being long sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care act have not voluntarily renounced a state-sponsored insurance to a collective complete with healthcare.gov , it now wants to sell millions of americans .
parents of sexual children can choose &quot; sex unbestimmt &quot;
germany is the first european nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals .
babies will no longer be rigid male or female zugewiesen .
under the new law , parents must explain no sex for such children , but &quot; vague &quot; or &quot; not fixed &quot; on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents , so that they must make no hasty decisions on operations for a gender allocation in newborns , and to combat the discrimination of sexual people .
an inter-sexual person , according to the bbc years later said : &quot; i am neither man nor woman . &quot;
i remain the flickwerk , created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year either a boy or a girl to the world .
they belong to the inter sexuellen , a group covered by the diagnosis &quot; sex differentiation disorder &quot; ( dsd ) , a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes , keimdrüsen ( eierstöcken or testes ) , or unusually developed genitalia .
wallis simpson was perhaps inter-sexually .
the understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the united states suggest that we should use the best available information on sex allocation , if a determination is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child , before you decide -- if any -- for a operation .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said the new german law &quot; blade for a good cause . &quot;
inter sexual children constitute an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but not for most of the children , &quot; he said .
you can make a sex allocation without operation and then wait to see how the identity entwickle .
the scientific data on , as a child his gender identity , are not very developed .
no one knows why it happens .
it is like the secret , why people are gay .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , to distinguish inter people are transgender or transgender people , because their status is not gender-related , but due to their biological condition , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both or not clearly defined as one of them .
these properties were in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair and genitals , breasts and stature ; primary sexual characteristics such as fortpflanzung bodies or chromosom structures and hormones .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination , inter-sexual and transgender people face in professional life and on the extent of harassment , violence , prejudice and crime .
not consistent with the gender image boys now have a special camp .
it is now possible in australia and nepal for adults , male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; on official documents .
in june australier norrie may-welby ( 52 ) , recognised as the world &apos;s first &quot; sex lose &quot; person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of &quot; undefined &quot; gender status .
german ausweise in m and w will have a third allocation , x for inter-sexually , the ministry of the interior .
in neighboring france , gender issues are still controversial , a news story on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strict catholic country signed a petition that the &quot; gender theory &quot; should be removed from textbooks .
the us site catholic online has also opposed the german law , with the explanatory statement : &quot; if the world dragged into a new state , where the gender , sexual activity but it is not a decision we verdrehen two other pillars of civilisation . &quot;
the mother of a newborn baby from maryland told zone , it would be better if babies at the birth of a sex zugewiesen .
&quot; the parents general is stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , &quot; she said of the parents website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who were born with both male and female sex parts , called hermaphroditen , after the greek god of both sexes .
ten years ago the medicine the sex as something that you can extinguish and then rebuild .
but in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation angezweifelt , now known as the gender identity is complex , and that doctors can be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels the aufwachsen with the sex assigned to them .
&quot; in the middle of the twentieth century called it a psychiatric emergency , &quot; drescher said .
if a child was born , then it is not the psychiatrists , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory on the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to dr. john money of johns hopkins university , took the view that gender is malleable .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives -- such as the parents of a child and a child -- acting with the genes and hormones , so consider whether a person is male or female .
but in a notorious under the title &quot; john / joan &quot; case from 1966 , his theories were controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was separated in a botched circumcision , the child to kastrieren and to remove his testicles and raise it as a girl .
&quot; money presented the case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , &quot; says drescher .
the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male and married a woman .
with 38 but he committed suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who practise this model .
but in the 1990s , with the introduction of the internet , survivors of these gender surgeries came to the public , are &quot; not happy with the result . &quot;
for example , jim bruce , a 36-year-old writer from montana , was born with male xy chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .
the doctors were not aware whether he had a great klitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfactory life &quot; as a man . &quot;
so were its external body and testicles surgically removed in 1976 and shortly after the birth he was brought up as a girl .
at the age of 12 he received female hormones .
&quot; i knew that i am not a girl , &quot; he said to abcnews.com
i was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he should receive a vaginoplasty .
but because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found was shocking .
i was sterilised in my birth -- and no one has ever said that to me .
bruce was born with a dsd , his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals .
after the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed .
the operation , it has become infertile .
today he fights for others in an organisation called interface project that inter-sexual people are perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the california -based legal group advocates for informed choice , is concerned that the german legislation &quot; to encourage abstempeln and stigmatisieren . &quot;
&quot; many activists are concerned that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child , not to define &apos; , &quot; she said .
we are afraid that the interventions .
we think that it would be better to wait for the male or female zuzuweisen and then .
but we do not know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said her organization support the australian law , because it allows adults recognition as a third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , &quot; she said .
the german law relates to the allocation of childbirth .
this is not a fight to the small children should force at this time .
when they grow up , they can decide on their body .
but dr. arlene baratz , a breast radiologin from pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation and hundreds of others in a self-help support group , says that the german law &quot; assigns &quot; both parents and children .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgen resistance .
because of the rezeptor defektes the target cells for testosterone katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus or ovaries .
katie is now 29 and married ; it works in child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania as a collaborator .
she is infertile , but hopes to get through adoption or a surrogate child .
&quot; the law gives parents , which they do not rush decisions , &quot; baratz said .
it gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female . &quot;
in this way , everything is in order -- you draw the child large and loves .
it has a wonderful baby and the parents happiness .
and we must not rush to an operation , which will no longer be reversed .
&quot; this includes the children in the decision-making and remove the fear the parents umtreibt , because they are of the opinion that they are not doing the right thing , &quot; she explained .
finally , the child decides the sex , the better with him , and that is wonderful .
this children are in a position to make the decision itself .
excellent the fight .
the role of santiago in hemingway &apos;s novel &quot; the old man , the old man and the sea , &quot; horst janson cut on the body .
janson is itself an old in his profession , the performing arts .
the old man in santiago can delude fishing .
so complement the two simply splendid .
one almost believes that the wrinkles in the old man &apos;s neck , of which the fishermen boy manolo speaks to see .
if janson santiago is tired of life gebeugt on the chair is real .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman a character through and through , janson excellent meistert .
hemingway told the story of a wrestler , a courageous man who does not abandon and ultimately by his knowledge and also his willpower to win the fight against the fish .
janson is in many respects as darsteller alone on the stage .
it is to focus the attention of the audience , so that his monologues are no boring .
his efforts to draw the fish up to the surface of the water , are so real that only the viewers forget that the sea of blue illuminated water bottles .
director jens hasselmann makes the old man in the boat in the fishing village .
in the course of the performance , he continues the active scene : the hut of santiago , the bar of the singer marie-luise gunst scandinavie the life of cuba , with their songs and beautiful voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
fancy eiscreme , shining in the dark ?
a british company has developed the first in the dark shiny ice -- with jellyfish .
charlie francis , the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a bright leckerei .
the idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and chinese scientists could convince the bright protein artificially .
the ice cream consumption with the tongue , causing the increased ph in the protein and the lights .
chris said , the speiseeis response to the heat in the mouth and luminaire -- the more you leckt , the brighter it is .
charlie , founder of &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious ice cream company , &quot; says : &quot; the product is unbelievable , but still at a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams of this for gbp 200 . &quot;
the protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral ph .
if the mouth of the protein erwärmt , increasing the ph and the ice .
we have tested in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to halloween on the market , because it has this wonderful leucht effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever produced , because the jellyfish leuchtstoff is four times more expensive than gold .
each bullet costs me about gbp 140 .
but it tastes delicious .
charlie &apos;s experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but his latest creation will be even more ambitious .
he says : &quot; i would like to develop an invisible eiscreme . &quot;
it is to be impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals , ice cream , but i suspect that we will find a way to create it .
the eiscreme uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish , the chinese scientists artificially .
salem : johanna rahner the Ökumenischen discussion forum
the next ecumenical forum on monday , october 21 , in the neues museum of the castle today is the issue of &quot; to hell with the hell theological reflections on dealing with the last things . &quot;
she is professorin johanna rahner .
the ecumenical forum is an initiative of the catholic and protestant church communities salem , salem and the culture of the lake constance circle .
johanna rahner wants to investigate how the forum for the people today the &quot; last &quot; after the death .
if the people in the past to know too much and those pictures of heaven and hell , &quot; the day our ideas , &quot; the contemporary prophetische lesson the hopes of completion by a certain verlegenheit zeichne or even sprachlosigkeit .
&quot; the greater hope of christian women and christians by the criticism of religion ausgetrieben , &quot; says the speaker .
&quot; they have provided us with so many question marks that seem to be lost ! . &quot;
johanna rahner goes on to say : &quot; but the key challenge remains the Ärgernis of death . &quot;

the throwaway society is not
the night was long , the music loud and the mood is good , but it is home .
however , in the bellies of the people on the front and rear seat is the hunger .
of course , this may be responsible for a cocktail or champagne .
what is more , as gechillt go to the next drive-in , to take a bite ?
i admit that i am pleased , when it comes to fast-food holen late at night or early morning .
a few chips , a coke , a burger and then nothing like home and to bed .
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gamers .
what must a lack that steter regelmässigkeit raises its fast-food bags from the car window ?
in particular , the weekends weggeworfene paper bags on road edges and parking .
&quot; why ? &quot; question .
the people are too dim to take the bags home ) until the next garbage ?
it is not just that the paper zeugs the landscape verschandelt .
bags have also covered transport facilities as barriers and caused by accidents .
so what does this &quot; throwaway society &quot; but not , presumably , they do not even know what that word means .
if you travel often , especially with several people in the car , you know , like a rückbank nights can be celebrated , clothes , bottles and other rubbish are .
a few bags would represent more or less but nix food scraps in contrast to the road , where no other rum trampeln .
i can already see the day when the areas to the cities and communities require for their bags pfand blöd and the fast-food chains .
milk and egg alternatives in the overview

a black box in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system , and believe to have found the solution in a small black box , the dashboard each car place .
the devices record and the information to the authorities every kilometer , are at the heart of a controversial experiment of washington and planning offices of the federal states to revise the outdated system of financing american roads .
the usually dull field of road planning suddenly sparked a debate with colourful alliances .
libertäre have allied with environmental groups and the government argue that the small boxes used for recording the kilometer -- and , perhaps , where they were driven , and can use the information for the calculation of tax notice .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and a number of data protection concerns .
but while in congress cannot agree on a procedure , several states are waiting no longer .
they are examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per driving mile .
thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring .
this is really a must for our country .
&quot; there is nothing that we only may use , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the southern california assn. of governments , a record of planning gefahrenen miles on all california motorists in the state by 2025 .
the way in which we pay these taxes , will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , financed from the taxes that americans pay at the pump , default .
but in america is no longer as much fuel as before .
cars consume less petrol .
the state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) , for 20 years has not increased .
politicians dare not with high fuel prices , raising the tax by a penny .
&quot; the gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , &quot; says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently 500 cars equipped with a tachograph , which tested a miles-based payment system .
&quot; this is the best alternative in the long term , &quot; he said .
bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee .
not surprisingly , the idea finds resonance in urban liberals , for example , the tax could be reduced to use to influence the driving behaviour so that congestion and carbon emissions .
the californian designers rely on the system , enshrined in the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious objectives of the state of climate change .
but the republican bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also stated that he is the best long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation , of the idea , drivers pay according to the distance travelled .
&quot; this is not a tax , which disappears into a black hole , &quot; says adrian moore , vice president for directives at reason .
the people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former american transport ministers , in a report in 2011 , had asked the congress to move towards miles-based billing .
last year , the us senate approved a $ 90 million costly pilot project involving 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives blocked the vorstoss and responding to the concerns of members from rural areas , the everyday people who have many miles on the way to work or in the city .
nevertheless , several states and large cities are moving on their own in this direction .
oregon is currently involved 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment of the country anwirbt .
these drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of mineral oil tax to the federal government .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such .
illinois testing it in limited with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the amendment .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue their every move .
&quot; concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , director of strategy and product management in the ministry of transport of nevada .
the people did not want it .
when the trial started , the aclu of nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be relatively easy to the tachograph into outright monitoring equipment . &quot;
there is no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure , which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
nevada is one of a number of states who are now looking for affordable technology , the state can collect gefahrenen miles , but not exactly when and where .
so , khan , would also reassure the public .
the pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company is not originally assumed to help states in the taxation of drivers .
its aim was to get a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of gefahrenen miles .
but the devices are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information , are regularly uploaded via modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and sites go unrecorded , &quot; said ryan morrison , ceo of true mileage .
in some of these big mistakes were made public pilot programs .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in oregon , planners are experimenting to give drivers a series of choice .
you can choose for a device with or without gps .
or you choose no device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all inhabitants of the state of gefahrenen miles .
other authorities hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public , by providing the equipment with more functions than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want a device to develop taxation , which also pay parking fees , insurance must be paid only for the kilometres and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .
&quot; drivers are motivated by the added value of the benefits the system offers , for participation , &quot; it said in a planning document of the city .
however , some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about the pay per mile is not only a huge distraction .
the metropolitan transportation commission for the san francisco bay area , officials said congress could solve the problem of the bankrotten highway trust fund simply by raising the fuel tax .
an additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so they pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no reason for an operation , although an aspirin is sufficient , &quot; said randy rentschler , the head of the commission &apos;s legislative and public affairs .
if we do , hundreds of millions of motorists concerned about their privacy and many other things .

snowden prepared to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany in relation to us surveillance
edward snowden , the whistleblower of us intelligence , said that he was ready to travel to berlin and testify before the german bundestag , when the us national security agency and its director keith alexander no answers about their activities .
the german mep hans-christian stroebele met snowden received asylum in russia , where this on thursday , to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , the media on friday of stroebele presented in berlin , writes , &quot; my government treated was clearly positive , even if the result of my efforts continue to a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political speech with strafandrohung a dissenting opinion , in which no defence is possible . &quot;
to tell the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the us government to drop the charges against him .
the charges levied by the us department of justice includes espionage and theft of government property .
the time online with german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said : &quot; if mr snowden is prepared to speak with german representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . &quot;
relations between the us and germany have been strained by the allegations that the nsa had bugged german chancellor angela merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
thomas oppermann , the mep who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence , snowden said , we should seize the opportunity to hear as a witness , if this is possible , &quot; without endangering him and ruining relations with the united states completely . &quot;
stroebele , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .

senior politicians and people around the world -- including in the united states -- have described the revelations about an unregulated system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general public .
in his letter , snowden makes a range of cooperation , &quot; the german authorities if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation has been resolved . &quot;
security concerns grow in mozambique in the face of clashes between influential personalities
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo &apos;s under the watchful eyes of a statue of samora machel , the founder and first president of mozambique , in a rare public demonstration peace calls to thin air .
&quot; we want peace , we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fear for the future of the country they exchanged business attire for a t-shirt with the words &quot; we call for security &quot; in portuguese and joined the crowd in independence square in the capital on thursday .
for two weeks , there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , which was supported initially by white-ruled rhodesia , and later by the apartheid government of south africa in a bid to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it has become an opposition party .
analysts consider it unlikely that the country falls back into a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .
there is a great deal at stake for the fast-growing economy , since the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could investment of more than $ 50 billion in the coming years by companies like rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko of the us in the country .
the ruling frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and renamo are blaming each other for the tension .
renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes by its members on october 17 , in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold renamos , have attacked .
the attacks on the former renamo rebels escalated , as government troops attacked stützpunkte renamos spokesman and tried to kill afonso dhlakama , leader of the group , said to the financial times .
the government blames renamo for the clashes and accused the organisation to have attacked soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about a instability .
on wednesday , he told afp , the french news agency , that dhlakama as &quot; losers , &quot; the &quot; use all its remaining forces he wants to show that the government cannot impose its decisions . &quot;
both frelimo and renamo to stress that they want to avoid a war .
but the concerns have increased since mazanga , with the words quoted , renamo give the peace agreements of 1992 .
he told the ft , he had meant that frelimo no longer respecting the agreement .
&quot; our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously , &quot; mazanga said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions have been fueled by a series of clashes this year .
&quot; we have two adult men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , the heads collide , &quot; said joseph hanlon , lecturer at the open university and expert on mozambique .
none of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , which is pushing for electoral reform , has already said it will boycott the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to kränkelnden movement , concessions and financial benefits from the government .
renamos electoral successes schrumpfen since 1992 , during a recent party , founded by a former renamo member movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , which are likely to improve the elections .
mazanga said that guebuza , whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year -- to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he wants no multi-party democracy , it does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to abandon the presidency , &quot; says mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo , but it has taken on a major north-south connections disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles .
most of the fighting took place in the province of sofala , a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , beira , is in the port , the export of coal mining companies like rio tinto and vale .
in june , rio disrupted the use of rail , a month after renamo announced an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo will repeat this threat .
renamo wanted &quot; the international community warn that the things in mozambique are not good , &quot; mazanga said .
the instability have increased frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of media coop , an independent media company , because many people worried already because of the corruption , the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping .
&quot; people think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country , and it should be one of the solutions to the problems , &quot; he says .
omar sultans , a demonstrator , said the people simply wanted stability .
&quot; no interested renamo and frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , &quot; he said .

but chen was later on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports on a state firm .
now the new express will undergo a &quot; comprehensive rektifizierung , &quot; the regulator said .
the &quot; rektifizierungan order , &quot; the agency for press and publications , radio , film and television in guangdong .
preliminary investigations showed that the new express , which is part of the yangcheng evening news group , between september 2012 and august 2013 had published several inaccurate reports about zoomlion , which is a listed company .
&quot; the editorial management of new express was disorganized , &quot; the regulator announced in a statement .

chen had written several articles for the new express , in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a construction manufacturer called zoomlion .
after he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and turned behind his journalistic work .
but then chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment .
&quot; in this case i damaged zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public , &quot; he said to the state news broadcaster cctv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and glory .
it has become clear to me that i was wrong .

the schatten hafte national security agency said late friday , a mistake their public website a few hours , and not , as has been suggested online .
&quot; nsa.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; explained the spy agency in a message sent by email .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( ddos ) carried out , is not true .
in the early hours of the evening was online server file noticed that the nsa website was not achievable and it is not for some users continue for at least six hours .
a spokesman for the nsa had previously told abc news that the sensitive internal network of the authority was &quot; in no way compromised . &quot;
confidential information are not in danger , according to the spokesman .
at least one group of hacktivisten took to the nsa website with a ddos attack crippled .

tax for foreign property owners against london &apos;s speculative bubble
the treasury has provisionally calculated , but still waiting for the final decision of the cgt action by chancellor of the exchequer george osborne , the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7 percent on homes that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers , the apartments as a company and not as individuals .
already exceed the revenue from the stamp duty on residential property in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , in the fiscal year 2012-13 amounted to gbp 708 million , the proceeds for northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north east , north west , yorkshire and the humber region together .
cook said : &quot; after the increases in the stamp tax on hochpreisige apartments and the introduction of related legislation against a taxed umgehen can hardly claim that high quality properties are too low , despite the impact of obsolete local taxation system . &quot;
&quot; but this step may make some foreign investors cautious , with regard to the purchase of real estate in london , or prevent owners to sell , &quot; he added .
first-class real estate -- the top five to ten percent of the housing market price -- in the wealthy south-west london belt , which stretches from fulham to wimbledon , increased to the record of 11.8 % last year .
prices in central london had a steady annual growth of 5.6 % , were overshadowed by an emerging &quot; domestic market , &quot; on the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 percent ) experienced an upward trend , a survey by savills .
even if the sg achim / baden for four days without a victory , the handball oberligisten is still good mood .
coach tomasz malmon is no doubt about that .
all remain fully motivated in the matter .
nevertheless , i hope that we can finally win again .
&quot; because i no longer know , as a victory tastes , &quot; a success experience of managing his team awaits malmon fredenbeck ii .
even if the drittliga reserve from fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted , malmon beforehand warnend the forefinger .
many players i myself still in the a-youth .
that is why they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach .
&quot; it is also to be seen whether another increase from the first is &quot; verdeutlicht the sg-coach .
to return to the track , the malmon team compared to previous appearances , in any case .
above all , in the coverage and the game haperte it least .
the chance of recovery must definitely be better .
i therefore hope that my players have finally the head during the short break free .

report : obama campaign considered to replace biden with hillary clinton
president barack obama &apos;s closest advisers have secretly considered to replace vice president joe biden in the 2012 election campaign by hillary clinton , the new york times .
the revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilemann on the 2012 election , &quot; double down : game change 2012 . &quot;
the times received a copy of the forthcoming book , and she reported on thursday evening that &quot; extensive group meetings and surveys carried out at the end of 2011 , &quot; the president &apos;s top adviser for obama &apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election , to see if it would look better if he let biden .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent for the times , the book is thoroughly the history of the efforts of senior staff of the campaign and the white house , namely former white house chief of staff bill daley , to measure what effect it had on the poll , to replace the former clinton against the vice president .
the potential change was a secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and in the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisers -- including daley , the former obama campaign manager , jim messina , and the former white house senior adviser david axelrod and david plouffe , knew about the change .
in &quot; double down &quot; says that daley has been at the forefront of efforts to replace biden despite their &quot; close personal relationship , &quot; before they finally decided against such a move , after the data showed that the candidacy of clinton &apos;s &quot; would not significantly improve obama &apos;s chances .
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace biden by clinton .
&quot; i made a whole series of things that we should consider , and that was one of them , &quot; daley told the magazine .
it must be remembered that the president had terrible poll , so we thought : &quot; for god &apos;s sake , what do we do ? &quot;
while daley described the investigation as &quot; due diligence , &quot; martin told anderson cooper of cnn that , during the campaign for re-election had been considerable effort to determine whether such a move in the polls auszahle .
&quot; in campaigns is not so much money spent on polls and focus groups , if you are not thinking seriously about something , &quot; martin said on ac 360 .
however , it is not clear whether obama knew that his team on an exchange nachdachte .
martin said on cnn that he asked daley whether his former boss about the potential change had known .
although daley said he does not believe that the president was aware of the possible change , &quot; &quot; the former chief of staff admitted that it was &quot; possible &quot; that obama knew .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; liefere no definitive answer to the question of whether the political sondierungen had reached obama &apos;s desk .
cooper asked martin if he seriously think obama knew nothing of the investigations on whether we should abandon biden in the elections .
&quot; possible , &quot; said martin .
council is pleased that sound budget
when it comes to the budget , mayor ralph gerster has a good laugh in council meetings .
the village säckl in herdwangen-schönach is well filled and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005 .
the financial year 2012 can also be entered as success in this sense .
this was in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andrea roth mouth , the administrative budget of around eur 7.6 million over a million euros higher than planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget is about eur 1.8 million around a million euros on the approach .
the surplus is mainly due to higher tax revenues and the share of the income tax .
the capital budget was again clear on the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is essentially due to the higher zuführung from the administrative budget , &quot; roth mouth .
since the financial year 2012 have been less investment than planned , the reserve zuführung is higher .
overall , the general reserve of approximately eur 2.1 million to eur 4.9 million .
mayor ralph gerster thanked roth mouth and her team for their excellent work .
&quot; this work not simply schüttelt from the sleeves , &quot; gerster with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local authorities were evident about the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely this good figures the citizens could soon be costly .
the good finanzlage , the town high hebesätze in the past .
this , in turn , are often according to gerster subsidies has been reduced from the country .
for these grants from various compensation sticks , there are conditions .
among other things , the cities and municipalities applying for grants , certain hebesätze .
&quot; hebesätze we must look at the issue , because in the next years investment , for which we would like to support , &quot; announced gerster in this context .

despair cry of obama voter
i have president obama twice in the hope that change is possible
he says obama had made commendable efforts have been thwarted by the blocking tactics the republicans
the blockade policy entschuldige not the problems of obamacare , the drone attacks
obama &apos;s memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at the harvard medical school .
i read a terribly sad book .
it is a book of which i thought i would be dull during the second year of my medical studies aufheitern and give me hope again .
it is called &apos; the audacity to win &quot; ( to win ) and the memoirs for president barack obama &apos;s 2008 election .
when i &apos;m done with my patients transcripts in the evening and go to bed , then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and a speeches breathless .
the election was held to a landslide victory and news spokesman , to consider the historical significance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers , they could find .
a team of young visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama went into office in 2008 , he had approval rates of 82 % .
and then i agree with the book .
umzuschalten again gerissen at the present is a rude awakening , as if from a dream .
it is hard to remember this optimistic times , they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first made my voice , indeed , something has changed .
but it is simply not what i imagined .
i recognise the great and seitigen things , obama has achieved , from the adoption of the affordable care act for medical insurance for military withdrawal from iraq , the end of the forced verschweigens of homosexuality in the army and the killing of osama bin laden .
i too am of the view that the political blocking tactics have tipped too many aspirations , which should be our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of guantanamo bay , to name but a few .
but after i have defended the obama administration to colleagues and friends countless times , i end with my statement .
i have reached a point of political despair .
the republican obstructionism cannot explain why the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency collects data on the private lives of americans and punished whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , a us citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report , which means that the efforts of the white house to having the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and jüngstens cannot excuse the inability , in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act to create a simple website .
i do not know whether this is what i would have expected .
if i work with 18 should understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the members office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the newtown massacre shape the public debate .
but when i look at the examples above , they seem to be elected by the government itself .
and what bothers me the most .
i chose obama again in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney , a confusing and unausgegorene alternative , he seemed not to be able to determine its direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would meet the hope which we had heard for so long .
but , with the sinking of the ratings below 45 percent for obama this week is returning to the 2008 book to become even harder .
it makes me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air .
this week i read a section in the book , which describes how obama had a serious loss against clinton in the primaries in pennsylvania einstecken .
in a meeting with the election officials after the decision he said his staff , they would come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
&quot; i would like that we find our magic , &quot; he said .
we need to remember who we are .
there are five years later , mr. president , and i could not agree with you more .
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of nathaniel morris .

the citizens pfullendorfs must adapt to higher energy costs .
