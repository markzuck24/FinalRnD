anger over the verdict to the organizers of the terrorist attack in bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bombing in bali in 2002 , angrily reacted to the sentencing of the last of the conspirators , who appeared in court and declared that umar patek has to be shot .
patek , who spent nearly 10 years on the run , as one of the most wanted men in southeast asia , was today sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of explosive devices that were used during the terrorist attack .
he could be released within 15 years if will get parole .
45-year-old defendant was convicted of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where 202 people were killed , including 88 australians , and wounded dozens more .
he was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges , including a wave of bombings of churches across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors have demanded a life sentence , although they could insist that the man nicknamed &quot; subversive element &quot; for his reputation as a master of manufacturing explosive devices , should be sentenced to death .
this decision aggravated the painful memories of mother from perth june kortin , who lost his 39-year-old twin daughters jane and jenny in the attack , carried out by patekom and his accomplices almost ten years ago .
barely containing tears , she said that patek was supposed to be sentenced to death .
&quot; i really believe that it should follow in the footsteps of other guys .
it should be brought to by firing squad , &quot; said ms. kortin aap .
i should live every day knowing that i will no longer be the grandchildren and i see my daughters . &quot;
&quot; sari club &quot; was destroyed when it was powered by a massive bomb , planted in a parked van outside , just after 11 pm , october 12 , 2002 .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , &quot; where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives , only 20 seconds before .
after this attack , he fell into a coma for a month and &quot; died &quot; three times , being connected to the life-support system .
mr. hughes said that patek has to share the fate of the other three members of the terrorist cell jemaah islamiyah responsible for the carnage , by amrozi , imam samudra and muhlasa , who were executed four years ago .
really , this guy deserves the death penalty .
to keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
get 20 years after it killed 202 and injures hundreds-not so much .
patek is the latest member of the terrorist attack in bali , appearing before the court .
he went into hiding for nearly a decade , but in the end , was detained in january 2011 , in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where u.s. troops killed the former leader of al-qaida osama bin laden less than four months later .
during the trial , an fbi agent testified that intelligence data showed : patek was in pakistan to meet with bin laden in an attempt to restore the connection between terrorist groups in southeast asia and al-qaida .
&quot; he didn &apos;t give up , &quot; said ms. kortin .
until recently he was not sorry about how much grief he caused to other people .
the sentence imposed in the run-up to the 10-th anniversary of the terrorist attack , which will be celebrated later this year in bali and australia .
&quot; this year will be a lot of tears , &quot; says ms. kortin .
patek still can appeal his sentence .

energy of dnipropetrovsk started a unique program to save ... nests of storks
in the old days , to bait to storks , villagers at the high post install wheel of carts and heavy jack was well on it .
these special bearings have long put , so they chose the pillars of power lines-twisted branches rely on wires , aistinyj house is secure .
granny ann , near the house in the village of ivanovka petrykau district for 20 years already living aistinaâ family , became noticed as jack settles , despite all the efforts of its inhabitants .
birds lay on top of new branches and the bottom layer is slid between the wires is about to collapse .
of course , feel sorry for the family of storks that nest every year in a farmstead , and were fattening summer three or four chicks , but i don &apos;t want to stay in the dark .
as soon as the birds flew away to warmer climes , grandmother anna rang in tsarychanka refs , which owns the building .
and even did not expect that there would respond so quickly .
when our experts came to ivanivka , they marveled that jack is still holding , &quot; said technical director of dtek energy company &quot; sergey berezovsky .
on the wires , which were , in fact , already inside the nest , making 150-200 kilograms , began the attack .
at any moment the birds could have died of electric shock .
and locals risked being left without light because of damaged wires .
therefore the linear fixers began an operation to rescue jack , this is not the first time in our practice .
scientists helped ornithologists from dnepropetrovsk national university , who developed the scheme of transfer .
they have held trainings for employees of regional networks .
the famous dnepropetrovsk ornithologist alexander ponomarenko has consulted at all stages of reconstruction of the power sockets .
to calculate that in the area of damaged more than 50 aistinyh &quot; flats &quot; .
for their reconstruction were welded special metal platforms , resembling a funnel .
the opleli with willow branches , and then moved to the old nest .
according to experts , is enough to put the old branch as a basis to find the nest and the birds are back in it .
then completed their own shelter storks .
a month ago in the village of peschanka novomoskovsk district was reconstructed the first nest .
next to the èlektrooporoj put a new reinforced concrete pole and placed it on the platform with the old , like a socket .
the whole operation has cost the employees at nine thousand uah .
and the other day the same housewarming took place in the village of ivanovka petrikov district on a farmstead grannies ani .
here the platform established in the same place , only lifted up over the wires .
ornithologists believe that the cautious , conservative birds won &apos;t even notice the spring that their &quot; apartment &quot; has undergone major repairs .
by the end of the year the same reconstruction expects another four nest in pokrovskoe and tsarychanka areas of dnipropetrovsk .
by the way , while some are rare birds , others mercilessly killed .
recently , the entire area was sad news-in the village of ust-heater village area , on the opening day of pheasant hunting , poachers shot the swan for the entertainment family , obitavšuû in the local pond .
noble birds is not at all afraid of people-local people they fed and not hurt .
when the villagers , hearing the shots , rushed to the pond , the four beauties-swans were already on the water dead .

vitaly mutko : gargoyles ?
it seems to me we have returned back 15 years .
sports minister vitaly mutko expressed his views on the unrest in the stands during a match of the russian cup &quot; shinnik &quot; - &quot; spartak &quot; .
i &apos;m advocating that for all this met the organizers of sports events , clubs , league , raf .
but we see that they took drguû position .
they are waiting for someone to come by and impose order .
this is a very good position , but not quite correct .
to organize supporters , clubs must invite their stewards , not to let the case take its course .
we now have developed a special decree on the rules of conduct at the stadiums .
once it is accepted , we will face this problem .
but i still have to invite all the organizers of football .
i read an interview with leonid will .
the state , they say , let &apos;s act faster .
the feeling is that this is bayern &apos;s fans in yaroslavl arrived and everything is staged .
and we outside observers .
but in general it is terrible-see how the hose of the water tribune .
and this in a country that is preparing for the world cup .
&quot; i have the feeling that we are 10-15 years ago have returned , &quot; said mutko .
a lawyer with cocaine addiction , which warned the leader of the gang of police investigations , imprisoned
42-year-old basharat ditta gave information to the criminal authority of the nile scarborough
the lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction will be disclosed
was sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment , the liverpool royal court .
a prestigious lawyer who told narkobaronu on a major police inquiry because he was afraid of exposing his secret addiction , was jailed for three years .
42-year-old basharat ditta gave criminal authority of the nile scarborough secret information on the investigation of drug trafficking after he was threatened because of his cocaine addiction .
the lawyer , nicknamed the bash and dubbed among criminals &quot; cool lawyer , was reportedly arrested at his home in 2011 , after a police operation on surveillance of scarborough , of which he was previously at the trial involving the drug .
officers noticed the 32-year-old scarborough left the three bags of cocaine near the house of a lawyer in the town of blackburn , lancashire county , while he was at a dinner with fellow lawyers association .
the investigation revealed that the &quot; regular use &quot; ditta drug class a , after tests revealed traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and credit cards .
during the eight months january to august 2011 , he tried to illegally obtain information about arrests of two men commissioned by scarborough , as well as one of his associates .
all four suspects were at that time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the marketing of heroin and cocaine in lancashire , cumbria , mersisajde , berkshire and west yorkshire .
they and another 32 people were later imprisoned after police seized during a series of raids by heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and more than £ 200 million in cash .
42-year-old ditta gave information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction will be revealed .
today at liverpool royal court ditta , who works at the law firm forbes solicitors , based in blackburn , was covered in shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at liverpool crown court .
he admitted to possession of cocaine at an earlier trial .
exposing the lawyer happened after police investigating the activities of scarborough , found that he regularly talked with ditta by phone starting february 2011 .
two detectives have tracked the suspects and discovered , as he approached the house in blackburn ditta and placed drugs 60 % pure black golf glove under the bins .
shortly after the transfer of the scarborough multiple sozvanivalsâ with ditta , who was at the dinner in a football stadium ewood park team blackburn rovers .
lawyer returned home for drugs ; among them were nine conversations .
the court heard that regularly used the &quot; ditta &quot; cocaine , after tests found traces of the class a drug in his hair , wallet and credit cards .
ditta was later arrested but denied cocaine use , said that he talked with the suspected dealer , because he was his client and insisted that their communication is &quot; advocate secrecy . &quot;
during his detention , ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards , but they were all confiscated , his hair sample was also taken .
the police interrogation he said that along with a work area , and he was a home office , and customers come to his home on legal affairs .
but the court learned that after important arrests he called the largest participants in the illicit traffic in drugs , some of which he had previously represented in court to tell what they know about the detectives .
in the accusatory speech anne whyte said : &quot; if someone knows that you should not break the law , then it is a criminal lawyer .
mr. ditta is accused of abusing his position , a criminal defense lawyer since he joined in too close relationships with specific clients .
contact that we are talking about is not just a drug dealer and a drug dealer supplying drugs of its own counsel .
some of his conversations , of course , would be legitimate , as he was their lawyer .
however , this greatly changed the boundaries of conventional relations between lawyer and client .
he let the police investigation as much as possible , to allow them to continue their criminal activities .
mr. ditta not honored his profession , and pozoril it .
he too went with certain customers , such as scarborough , and had doubts about its lack of interest .
ditta is not admitted guilt and said : &quot; if i was a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and wish to convey information to mr. scarborough , i would not have waited for 3 : 0 pm , i would do it immediately . &quot;
but after the meeting , a senior officer of the lancashire police of halstead said : &quot; mr. ditta turned from a criminal defense lawyer in the criminal offender , as only began acquiring drugs from members of organized crime &quot; .
his addiction to cocaine has made it hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to major participants of criminal gangs , who have charged him with collecting valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and instill public trust and confidence .
mr. ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind their profession .
the investigation into mr. ditta led unit lancashire on serious organised crime , which already has a sentence with regard to three cases , the storage of cocaine , and now to prevent the execution of justice , demonstrating our commitment to achieve a just punishment for criminals .
let this serve as a warning to criminals that nobody is beyond the reach of the law .
we will find you and bring to justice .
the scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt to conspiracy to supply heroin , cocaine and marijuana .
another 35 people participating in the scheme , were sentenced to a total 153 years for drug-related crimes .
on his website , ditta organized conversation in the form of questions and answers , in which he said that his dream is a lawyer representing clients with the death penalty in america , the perfect companion for him over dinner — muhammad ali , and motivation in the work is the inequality .
manufacturers of jet aircraft are about the width of the seats at stake , when large orders
among the leading manufacturers of aircraft broke out a bitter dispute over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights , setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the dubai air show this month .
the dispute revolves around the width of seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class , whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines , but that the amount of allocated space for them to play a key role in the allegations about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by airbus sas and boeing co .
airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard , which would seat width of not less than 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in economy class , but its main american rival boeing says it must deal with the airline .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales all of larger versions of its twin-engine , long-haul aircraft , and the 17-21 november expected the potentially record-breaking orders .
layout of the back of the plane — especially whether sit 9 or 10 people in a row — is central to the statements on the economic viability of new projects &quot; airbus &quot; .
boeing claims that its updated 777x will accommodate 406 people , coming from the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width , placed over 10 in each row .
airbus said that the competing version of its a350 will transport in the economy class 350 people in seats 18 inches wide , located on the number 9 .
aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues through advertising in the professional press .
now airbus is drawn directly to the public before the air show in dubai , where 777x is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders .
she recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing the financiers slide depicting three people in the restaurant , pressed to each other , under the name &quot; you would agree to that ? &quot;
&quot; boeing offers long haul flights on the seats are narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft , &quot; said airbus sales director john leahy .
with the change of diet people gaining weight , but the aircraft seat is fundamentally unchanged .
between the beginning of the 1970 &apos; s , when wide-body boeing 747 has set standards of modern long-haul trips , and overseas century weight average american men aged 40 to 49 years old increased by 10 percent , according to the health department of the united states .
the average american male waist 21 century is 39.7 inches , according to the statistics of the health service of the united states .
airbus says its competitor adheres to the concept of seat-1950 &apos; s , when the average waist of those recently called &quot; reactive public &quot; , was already .
airbus said it had commissioned a study , which indicates that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep to 53 per cent .
boeing disputed airbus &apos;s figures on the sizes of seats and said that producers should not interfere with decisions about how the airlines find the balance between rates and amenities .
she said research shows that convenience compartment depends not only on the width of the seat .
&quot; everyone really is to let airlines of choice and opportunity to do what they feel they need to do to achieve success , &quot; said boeing &apos;s specialist shops kent krejver .
they don &apos;t want us to decide for them that will bring them profits .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , question is to increase the space on the sides , but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that could affect profits .
this dispute is worth keeping up with orders for aircraft valued at least $ 700 billion at catalog prices over the coming decades is enough to change the balance of american and european exports .
as first reported in july , reuters , arrangement of seats is exactly what fuels rivalries in the battle between the latest jet aircraft .
both airbus and boeing have about 20 % increase profitability for one seat in their latest twin-engine , long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat boeing 777-300er .
boeing &apos;s performance claims are based in part on comparing 10-local 777x with original series 9-local 777 design series layout .
gain in unit cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout , used currently .
&quot; the reason that boeing is doing this is to cram more seats and make his plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort , airbus in europe .
on the other hand , analysts say that salons with full 10-local numbers for existing 777-x indicates that many passengers prefer the tight seating arrangements which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs .
&quot; seat width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers , but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the airbus proposal due to the threat from the th model 777 , said interior salon specialist mary kirby , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing do not deliver , but offer a directory of suppliers , from which the airline can choose .
traveling the world jet dealers even carry a tape measure to check for competing design .
praising the comfort , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense interior layout for low cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus is offering the a350 with 10-local numbers , but said that it already sold .
until recently , airbus has stressed the need for further modifications of the salons , offering wider seats pass on some of their planes .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft , experts say , its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to &quot; take off &quot; , but it could divert attention from a wave of sales model 777x .
oleynikov : one third of rural settlements near moscow fully grant
deputy governor of the moscow region yuri oleynikov said that nearly a third of the rural settlements of the moscow region are fully subsidized
total dotations from budget of the region receive 187 settlements from 288 .
in 2013 , the settlement of 187 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget .
the share of grants in the amount of budget income 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 % , and 83-100 % grant .
within the framework of the fiscal capacity of the regional budget is sent to about 25 billion rubles , &quot; oleynikov .
the lieutenant governor also noted that only three towns-mytischi , moscow and mytishchi-income budget amounts to more than 1 billion roubles for the year 2013 .
revenue villages in many areas of less than 3 million rubles , &quot; this is not enough . &quot;
the cost of the local administration in 88 settlements near moscow is over 70 % , &quot; with a lower quality of services , &quot; noted oleynikov .
previously , he directed the heads of municipal formations of the moscow region until the end of november to consider whether settlements are in need of consolidation , integration in urban districts or change of administration .
these proposals will be worked out by the end of january .
the governor of the moscow region said that within the framework of administrative reform in moscow is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements .
also in moscow , kashirskoe , settlement , kolomenskoe , lyubertsy and kotelniki is a consolidation of municipalities .
discussion of this issue in the region &apos;s cities and districts will begin in november .
chairman mosobldumy igor bryncalov also stated that the total combined in the upcoming admreformy to about 30 villages in 12 districts of the moscow region .
this is due to the fact that out of the 178 villages in the moscow region , less than a third have a &quot; reasonable &quot; financial base and 100-grant .
concern about security is rising as a result of the conflict in mozambique , influential people
under gazing down on them from the top down statue of machel , zamora , president-founder of the mozambique , thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo , to chant slogans of peace in one of the few demonstrations here .
&quot; we want restoration of peace ; we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , executive director of the investment company .
fearing for the future of their country , she changed her business suit on a t-shirt adorned with the inscription &quot; we demand security &quot; in portuguese , and on thursday joined the crowd in the capital &apos;s independence square .
within two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once known by the rebel movement , which was supported at first by the white rhodesia and then south africa &apos;s apartheid-era government in an effort to destabilize independent of the government .
after the armistice of 1992 onwards it became the opposition party .
analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back to full-scale conflict , but recent events had made nervous foreign investors and local residents .
the stakes are high for the fast-growing economy , since the discovery of huge offshore oil reserves of gas and coal deposits in the northwest can bring more than $ 50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko of the united states .
the ruling frelimo party , the leading political force since 1975 , and renamo party accuse each other of this tension .
renamo party alleges that the government was the instigator of recent clashes by attacking its members in sofala province , a traditional stronghold of renamo , 17 october .
the attack on the former rebels then worsened when government troops attacked the base of renamo and attempted to kill afonso dhlakamu , the leader of the group , told the newspaper the financial times , fernando mazanga , spokesman for renamo .
the government blames renamo in initiating the clashes , accusing the party of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to dispel fears of instability .
guebuza told afp , the french news agency , on wednesday that mr. dhlakama felt &quot; looser &quot; , wishing to use &quot; all that was left of his force to try to prove that it can impose its own solutions to the government .
both frelimo and renamo insisted that they want to avoid war .
but fears have grown after reports that mazanga said renamo refusal from the 1992 peace agreement .
he told the financial times that the lack of agreement meant the party frelimo .
&quot; our goal is to return to the negotiating table , but in all seriousness , &quot; said mazanga .
previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tensions that intensified a series of clashes this year .
&quot; these are two influential person ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , faced off against , &quot; said joseph hanlon , lecturer at the open university and an expert on mozambique .
none of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is willing to make the necessary concessions .
party renamo , which tries to achieve electoral reforms , has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted this as an attempt to pressure the weakened the movement and financial bonuses to get concessions from the government .
the share of votes for renamo has been decreasing since 1992 , while the new party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) , which is a former member of renamo , is expected to improve its performance in this election .
mr. mazanga said that mr guebuza , who must step down from the post next year , when his second term runs out , wants to destroy democracy in the country .
&quot; he does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; said mazanga .
it is unclear what renamo , but she has already had devastating and sweeping attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway from the north to the south .
most of the clashes took place in sofala province , which is a few hundred kilometers north of maputo , beira , a port that mining companies including rio tinto and vale , used to export coal .
in june , rio has suspended the use of railways by about week after renamo has threatened an attack on the railway .
mazanga was evasive when asked whether renamo will repeat that threat .
renamo party wanted to &quot; warn the international community that the case in mozambique are not going well , &quot; said mazanga .
instability has increased discontent with the government , but many people also care about corruption , the slow pace of development and the frequent recent kidnapping , said fernando lima , head of the independent media company mediacoop .
&quot; people think that the responsibility for the future of the country rests with the government and the president , who must find the solution to these problems , &quot; he said .
omar sultuan , a member of the demonstration , said people just want stability .
&quot; no one cares neither renamo nor frelimo , they just want a resumption of peace , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
rules for using electronic devices aboard aircraft in australia so far will remain in force
australian airline passengers will continue to switch off their tablets and smart phones during takeoff and landing , in spite of the measures in the united states to ease the rules on these devices .
united states federal aviation administration allowed u.s. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch video or play games on their devices during take-off and landing , provided that those will remain in &quot; flight mode &quot; .
passengers can already do it during the main part of the flight , but many angry that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing .
australian carriers are considering the decision that generated from the american airlines spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements , but indicated that they had no plans to in the near future to change its procedures .
in the management of civil aviation security have also indicated that they are considering this statement , but stressed that the restrictions on use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight are still active in australia .
the office of civil aviation security currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in the aircraft , &quot; it said .
this issue is governed by the rules that require air carriers to ensure the maintenance of security at any time , and from passengers — to follow safety rules that are reported to them , members of the crew .
virgin , which has already been discussed with the office of civil aviation security extension use on board its entertainment system with wi-fi , was not against change but stated that it would follow the governor .
&quot; we would welcome a review of the office of civil aviation security issue about the use of electronic devices , because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it ( the onboard wireless entertainment system ) on our planes , &quot; said the spokesman .
qantas said it will stick to the currently effective regulations .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing , and in the near future , we have no plans to change it , &quot; she said .
the faa directive applies to american airlines .
however we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit passengers , and we will carefully examine the fÃo and reasons that caused it .

coulson resorted to hacking your phone to verify a private message
a former editor of the news of the world andy coulson allegedly used the phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; when attempting to confirm the false information about the novel , charles clarke , who was at that time the minister of the interior .

the newspaper had asked private investigator glenn mulkejru polbi voicemail hack and it was at the house to interview , but also called her and coulson left a voice message is heard by the court .
&quot; the prosecution considers that mr coulson , who is now the editor of the notw , it is not the kind of person who will stand near anyone &apos;s ever home , hoping to catch someone off guard , he is a man who likes to suggest a story for people to see what they will say , &quot; said mr edis .
he said the newspaper news of the world used three methods to investigate stories : hacking phones , shadowing and confrontation .
the editor is personally implicated in the third .
obviously , he knows about the second , about surveillance , it just has to .
what about first ?
if he knew about the phone hacking ?
he said that no , we say : &apos; oh , yes ! &quot;
rumors about clark &apos;s first novel attracted the attention of the edition of the news of the world , when the source , sexually interested in mrs. polbi , said : &quot; don &apos;t waste your time with charles .
cassette voice messages received with the phone at least three times , was seized from the house of mulkejra in august 2006 .
investigators also found the recorder on your pc private eye , in which miss polbi and her sister appeared as &quot; projects &quot; .
during the period when she was under surveillance , grandmother and grandfather of mrs. polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her , said mr edis .
at that time , a former chief reporter neville tërlbek and former reporter james uèzerap supervised the surveillance of the movements of mrs. polbi .
leaving a voice message on june 18 , 2005 , coulson said : &quot; i have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and i would very much like to discuss with charles .
mr edis said that the participation of koulsona in this story was the same scenario as with other influential people such as former minister of the interior , david blankettom .

the bases of the no group &quot; brotherly circle &quot; , to which the united states listed the leps
in the databases of russian law enforcers group fraternal circle &quot; , to which washington has ranked singer gregory leps , is not mentioned .
according to &quot; interfax &quot; in law enforcement , after media reports emerged about the ministry of finance of the united states gregory leps in checklists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal syndicate &quot; brotherly circle &quot; have been checked all the database , but this group has been found .
dissemination of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called &quot; russian mafia &quot; which supposedly operates abroad , believed in the power structures .
&quot; even in the very name of &apos; brotherly &apos; circle , there is a certain element of mystery , contains a hint of covert lodge .
&quot; all this is very similar to the pr-action , &quot; the spokesman said .
the ministry of finance of the united states on october 31 announced the listing of its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal syndicate &quot; brotherly circle &quot; arthur badalyan , gregory lepsveridze , vadim lyalin , sergey moskalenko , james rybal ′ skogo and igor shlykov .
persons listed in this list , suspected of having links with some vladislav leontief and ghaffour rakhimov , who are considered to be influential members of criminal groups and in the sanctions list united states from february 2012 .
according to us authorities , grigoriy leps &quot; serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of władysław of leontiev .
in producing heart of grigory leps refused to comment on the accusations against the united states , calling them &quot; nonsense . &quot;
in 2011 , the president of the united states barack obama carried syndicate &quot; brotherly circle &quot; as &quot; significant transnational organized criminal groups &quot; and instructed the finance ministry to &quot; undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations . &quot;
recording in black lists of the american ministry of finance entails the freezing of his assets in the united states and a ban on business contacts with persons residing in the states .
scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail the dog tied to its mood .
earlier studies have shown that satisfied the dog wags its tail , in the right side ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while alarmed by the dog &apos;s tail pomahivaût mainly in the left side .
but now scientists say that other members of the family canidae can notice these subtle differences in the wagging tail and to respond to them .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist from trent university , said : &quot; it is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain in different ways participate in the formation of the motivators that cause positive or negative emotions .
here we have tried to look at it in other species .
he added that just as in humans , dogs , the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa , and the two hemispheres have different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how the dogs react to versatile povilivaniâ tails of other dogs , the researchers observed the animals when they were watching movies about other dogs .
they measured the frequency of heartbeat and analyzed their behavior .
perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have shown dogs videos with dogs is a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors , and we were able to manipulate the movement of the tail and tail more left or right .
when the animals saw that otherwise nothing expressing dog tail has moved to the right ( from the point of view of the vilâûŝej tail dogs ) , they remain completely relaxed .
but when they noticed that the tail is mainly left leaning ( again from the point of view of the dog &apos;s tail vilâûŝej ) , their heart was and they looked alarmed .
professor vallortigara said he did not think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements .
in fact he believes that dogs have learned from their experiences what moves they should worry about , and what is not .
he said : &quot; if there is a number of meetings with the other dogs and often wobbling their tail to one side due to the more friendly behavior , and the right side gives a less friendly behavior , the dog reacts on the basis of that experience .
the researchers say that these results can give owners , veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of the animal .
dog behavior expert john bradshaw , a visiting fellow at the veterinary school of the university of bristol , said that this was not the first study to test whether a value for the left and right side .
last year , a team of scientists from the university of lincoln has found that dogs are turning heads left , if you look at the aggressive dog , and to the right , if you look at enough dog .
and in the other scientific work at the university of victoria in canada , he said : &quot; the dog is more suited to the dog-robot when wobbling her tail went to the left , not the right , instead of becoming unnerved , the opposite behavior in relation to the italian study &quot; .
he said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully accept animals in the movies or the dog-robots as dogs .
it might be useful to study how the dogs react to these dogs , &quot; he explained .
while on various mammals , there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes , many details have yet to be clarified , and the dog is not an exception , &quot; he said .
however , given the ease with which they can be registered , probably , soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes another .
is the elite of europe to do business with england ?
business for britain campaign was launched in april with a commitment to bring together representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the uk want to see in the relations with the eu .
to this end , we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of british business leaders , asking them to express their thoughts about the uk , and the eu .
the company lower than govt estimates ... interviewed over 1000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of business in the united kingdom by size , sector and region .
findings of the survey will be a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of europe , with particular attention to the countries which are modernizing and growing , while eu countries are deadlocked .
they want the government gave priority to new trade relations with countries such as china , india and brazil , instead has spent time on the long and difficult process of reforming the unwieldy eu institutions .
when they were asked about their views on specific policy issues , from antitrust to product legislation , most business leaders believed that control of these key competencies must be returned to westminster .
there was a general dissatisfaction with the single market , the business representatives said that the cost of regulation from brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the commercial area of europe , agreed that even 40 percent of large enterprises , traditionally the most pro-european of all companies .
the last and most exemplary-our survey managers revealed that a clear majority wants the united kingdom conducted a course on the review of the treaty and on relations with the eu , based on trade and not on politics .
this result , which was observed among businesses of all sizes and major business groups , shows that business insists on a &quot; significant change &quot; , which will return the power back to the uk .
the stakes are high-achieving changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the uk will provide 16 percent shift in voting for it to remain in the eu .
the prime minister , there should be no doubt : this poll shows that british business supported his plan to review the conditions of membership in the eu .
it also shows that business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the balance of power back toward britain .
the best conditions for british businesses are becoming more necessary as the eurozone is on the road to closer economic and monetary union .
priority should be given to employment and economic growth in the uk , and , as shown by the results of our survey , for business it means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the normative work of brussels .

in siberia should not be vegan : hothouse &quot; tomato &quot; is no substitute for soup
why vegetarianism is not fit to live in siberia , the ria novosti correspondent clarified .
people completely renounced the animal products do not have to live in siberia .
here they don &apos;t relocate the winter without health losses and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them , interviewed on the eve of the new siberian vegana nutritionists and doctors .
drinking litres of oil
veganism when refuse not only from meat and fish , but also from the milk , honey , eggs , becoming fashionable lifestyle .
however , doctors-nutritionists believe in novosibirsk and other cities of siberia to follow such strict rules , at least , health healing .
complete avoidance of animal products is harmful .
in animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for the plant .
be sure to include in the diet at least milk or eggs , &quot; sure marina bogaj nutritionist .
she gives an example of a fish that contains the essential fatty acid omega-3 .
the richest oil-flaxseed .
&quot; to consume it in the necessary quantities for human need litres of drink ! &quot; says the nutritionist .
doctors are confident that the people of siberia , particular attention should be paid to the diet in winter .
in this season of vegetarianism is particularly challenged .
in terms of our realities , there are high demands for food .
to stay warm , need a higher energy value .
&quot; if people are limits on animal products , respectively , the caloric value of it were buying , &quot; said the expert .
agree dietitian olga poznyak .
she added that imported fruits and vegetables-not an option .
man eat better with that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born .
the genetic code is configured for a better absorption and digestion of these products .
in winter people want to gnaw the gherkin , and not hot supčika or something posytnee &quot; , explained its position .
according to her , that there are vegans , can really help a variety of grains , cereals , legumes , local vegetables , apples , remaining in the winter , the frozen berries .
but it &apos;s definitely not enough for sufficient nutrition .
in the opinion of the physician-gastroenterologist claudia arifulinoj , siberians in sufficient level of vitamins only from mid-august to mid-september .
full transition to vegetarianism in our hard environmental conditions where the temperature may be changed 24 hours at 30 degrees and the snow in may , is not practical .
body for life needs energy , and it is , above all , the fat , &quot; said the medic .
doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women .
children grow up , they need building material , including in the form of amino acids .
and adhering to vegetarianism , we give them defective .
pregnant women also need increased content of protein , vitamins and trace elements in the menu .
&quot; veganki their loses &quot; bogaj , believes .
arifulina said that an adult is free to choose anything you like , &quot; play the toys that wants to . &quot;
he has already formed the body , skeleton , organs .
and the kids still need to eat properly .
if the parents deprive it of any minerals or amino acids , choosing for him that he will be there , it is simply a violation of the rights of the child .
&quot; lack of substances for the development of the brain , eyesight , bone will not tomorrow , &quot; she said .
all interviewed health professionals agree on the low quality of cultivated in greenhouses in winter and imported fruits and vegetables .
what is brought to us and grown in greenhouses , contains fewer than the number of needed trace elements than the ( vat ) in open ground .
&quot; the quality of the products is not the &quot; bogaj says .
arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are less than ideal standards .
sometimes the desire of manufacturers to collect larger crop is detrimental to quality .
&quot; apples turn brown on the cut cucumbers turn yellow and rapidly grow mouldy , tomatoes tasteless and nearomatnye &quot; , gives examples of the physician , adding that they would likely tainted with excessive amounts of fertilizers .
and are not suppliers of vitamins and fiber .
zavlaboratoriej does not agree with the siberian physico-technical institute of agrarian issues , candidate of agricultural sciences vera petruk .
she said that with the right approach and compliance with all rules and requirements may be growing in greenhouses full of vegetables .
if you are trying to kick out more with a square meter , then , of course , and the water will become more frequent , and overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers .
for example , when too much nitrogen fertilizer , tomatoes are growing fast , they are large , but watery and sweet , &quot; she explains , adding that the issue of quality is primarily a factor of conscience from the manufacturer .
russia out of the struggle for urban pollution cars
attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in most megacities in the world since the second half of the 20th century .
as a rule , it was either on their refurbishment and expansion of highways , or about trying to reduce the demand for automobile travel , vehicle number and time of their use .
widely known example of singapore which has strict quotas for growth in the private car , and the right to acquire them , purchased at auctions .
its price is two to three times higher than the price of the car itself .
european cities , including london , have introduced a fee for entry to the city centre .
in germany , for example in hamburg and stuttgart , introduce the so-called green zone , where the only vehicles allowed to enter with a certain èkoklassom , who use the fuel quality ( including biofuels or electric cars ) .
beijing &apos;s environmental protection agency , for example , approved in the year 2012 , &quot; five-year plan for clean air &quot; worth about 250 billion yuan ( about us $ 40 billion ) .
according to kommersant , the director of the division of transport pollution control of the municipal environment protection bureau of beijing li kunšeng , the main objective of the five-year plan to reduce the leading air pollutants on 20-35 % by the year 2017 , growth in the number of private cars to a level no greater than 6 million ( 5.2 million ) , as well as the increase of no more than 5 % of fuel use per vehicle .
according to the agency , now vehicles in beijing responsible for 22.5 % of the total air pollution .
among the major measures , the restriction of the use of motor vehicles , as well as the introduction of additional tax for car owners .
among other things , the city &apos;s &quot; green plan &quot; includes an accelerated compared to the rest of the country transition to european standards , the introduction of local eco-standards and labelling of cars and fuel , the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the central part of the city , the ban on the use of outdated vehicles ( in addition , the creation of the incentive of financial programmes , replacement of old cars for hybrid or electric cars ) , the development of electric transport ( including public and restricted ) , development of public transport ( including broadband ) .
the road of innovation of beijing also include a ban on all private vehicle traffic within the fifth ring road ( the capital of the republic of china their six ) one day a week ( this information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle ) , as well as the issue of registration plates for vehicles based on the lottery ( for example , in the year 2011 , the first year of operation of the lottery , the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in beijing amounted to only one-third the number of 2010 year ) .
in accordance with the state program &quot; environmental protection at the 2012-2020 &quot; , the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 ( 138 year 2012 ) .
according to the ministry , in 2011 , to &quot; mobile sources &quot; accounted for 41 % of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere .
in moscow , for example , emissions from cars in ten times greater than the industry , and , in st. petersburg , nine times .
in the russian federation is only beginning to think about the possibilities of a restrictive regulation of cars on the streets .
director of the institute of transport economics and transport policy hse mikhail blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures to suppress demand for car travel is notoriously unpopular , they can be accepted by the society only if their full universality .
in the case of moscow a unique problem with the structure of its truck fleet , where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory actions-office and personal cars , and cars &quot; privileged &quot; users , the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand . ( about 5 % of the total fleet of moscow ) .
recently the urbanists of ecom center in st. petersburg prepared a study which examines the balance between residential buildings in urban areas , the area of the road surface and the number of motor vehicles .
the main findings of the researchers : city centre roads have two times less required , and most motorists living in the center , do not use cars every day , leaving them for long periods of time in parking lots or on the streets .
as a result of a build parking , and car storage , not to expand and reduce traffic ( so that the streets were more friendly for pedestrians ) , as well as limit the use and placement of personal transportation within the buffer zone of the historic centre ( total area about 3212 ha , covering a number of the central districts of the city ) .
the fuel price rise will lead to a tax maneuver , which involves raising the mining tax ( tax ) on oil simultaneously with reduction of export duties and excises .
according to experts , these measures could bring in additional budget 619.3 billion rubles .
a trip through the mud , rivers and jungles to provide free medical care

bvelle and his team spend almost every weekend , taking hundreds of patients
in this west african country , doctors are not so much — just one in 5000 people
vote here or via your mobile device
dr. george bvelle , one of the 10 main characters cnn 2013 year .
you can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters , so that it became the hero of the year by cnn .
this person will receive $ 250,000 to continue his outstanding work .
for 21 years , georges bvelle saw as his father came back to life again , he fell into unconsciousness , wandering on to hospitals that were not equipped properly to help him .
džamef bvelle is injured in a car crash in 1981 , near yaoundé , capital of cameroon .
at first it was only a broken arm , but the infection has spread to the brain and caused a hematoma , which was reminiscent of himself until the end of his life .
&quot; no neurosurgeons in cameroon , &quot; said georges bvelle .
if we had money , we would have taken him from cameroon .
instead , over the years , accompanied his father bvelle in crowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment they can get .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; said bvelle .
— you can get away from home to 5 am , run back to the hospital to be first , but you are not the first .
patients very much .
some may die due to the fact that they have to wait .
the situation has not changed much since his father bvelle died in 2002 .
according to the world health organization , in cameroon , only one doctor per 5000 people .
in comparison , the ratio in the united states is one doctor per 413 people .
and even if the cameroonians to see a doctor , for many of them it would be too expensive .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of health care costs in it are private .
&quot; their only problem is poverty , &quot; said bvelle .
and because of the poverty they may not enjoy their lives . &quot;
seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots , bvelle became determined to do something about it .
last year , dr. george bvelle and his team of volunteers have spent 700 free operations .
he became a physician and surgeon in vascular works central hospital of yaoundé .
he also founded ascovime , a non-profit organization which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care .
in 2008 , he and his group of volunteers provided assistance to almost 32000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people jam into the vans , strapped to the roofs of medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit needy villages .
not always be lucky .
time and again they had to push the car across the river and mud .
but when they arrive , they are greeted as heroes : a celebration with singing and dancing and the best facilities that may offer local residents .
free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration , and bvelle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning , the crew begins to take hundreds of patients .
&quot; we have 500 people each trip , &quot; said bvelle .
they come from the neighborhood within a radius of 60 km from the village , and they come on foot .
each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services .
many people receiving treatment for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , parasites , diabetes and sexually transmitted diseases .
others may get crutches donated glasses or free birth certificates , documents required for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team conducts a simple operation under local anesthesia .
the operation is usually held in the school , municipality or in the house ; after the procedure , patients are and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person .
using a generator to light the operating and sanitary processing equipment , bvelle and its volunteers work until early sunday morning .
it &apos;s backbreaking pace , but the sense of brigade usually help maintain village musicians .
&quot; they all night and beat drums to be awake , and continued to work , &quot; said bvelle .
on sunday , members of the brigade are sent back to the city , tired but proud of its work .
this group , consisting of the cameroonian foreign doctors and medical students , carried out 700 free operations over the past year , and they know that their support could be crucial to those they are helping .
one man explained that he received free surgery for hernia treatment will enable him to work again .
&quot; it &apos;s going to change the future for me and my family , &quot; said the man .
in addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon bvelle also works nights in private medical clinics around yaoundé .
it is this second job , he said , provides 60 % of funding his nonprofit organization ; the rest are covered by private donations .
&quot; i don &apos;t even know when he &apos;s sleeping , &quot; said katie o &apos;malley , second-year medical student dreksel ′ skogo university in philadelphia , a volunteer group bvelle .
it is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization , to continue the campaign .
for future doctors and nurses such as o &apos;malley , coming from the united states and europe , to join the bvelle in implementing its tasks , this is an opportunity to practice that they never would have received at home .
&quot; we were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep the tools for dr. bvelle , &quot; said o &apos;malley .
as a student-vtorokursnikom , you would have never got that opportunity in america .
student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to cameroon , often arriving from offering medicines .
but on arrival in yaoundé from their meals , transport and education pays bvelle .
&quot; he is a hero , no doubt , &quot; said o &apos;malley .
he paid his life for this organization , and its desire to help the people of cameroon .
for bvelle almost constant load of work is not an ordeal .
help to live a happy life , this his father promise is what brings him great joy .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy when doing this job , &quot; said bvelle .
and i think about my father .
i hope he sees what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m doing it so people laughed to relieve their pain .
go to ascovime and see how you can help .
the &quot; russian mafia &quot; in the united states finally established a new name- &quot; brotherly circle &quot;
this week the black list &quot; russian mafia &quot; in america with new names and four companies .
the ministry of finance of the united states has &quot; fraternal circle &quot; three representatives of russia , two uzbek citizens and israelis .
one of the russians was a famous singer grigoriy leps , which the united states suspects of carrying money for members of the grouping .
all in all , the united states blacklisted 22 people involved in &quot; brotherly circle &quot; , and six affiliated organizations .
however , many experts have expressed doubt that such an organization exists .
&quot; statement of &apos; the sister circle &apos; is more like an attempt to unite the scattered criminal groups , &quot; previously said an expert on organized crime and new york university professor mark galeotti .
in his view , the &quot; fraternal &quot; reflected the popular perception of the &quot; russian mafia &quot; .
&quot; i haven &apos;t met anybody in the russian law-enforcement bodies or elsewhere , who confirmed the existence of the criminal organization , &quot; galeotti , american center for the study of corruption and organized crime .
with mr. lenz agreed and george mason university professor liz shelley .
&quot; if they act together , then it &apos;s more like a criminal network , but not the organization , &quot; brings her words of the center for the study of corruption and organized crime .
in the middle of last year by mark galeotti suggested that &quot; bratski krug &quot; brings together the increasingly close russian kingpin aslan usoyan , known as ded hasan .
crime boss was killed in january this year .
so , lasha Šušanašvili and zacharias kalashov , round in 2012 , has been closely associated with santa hassan , another participant list , temuri mirzoev , was the grandfather of hassan &apos;s nephew .
nevertheless , mr. lenz notes that some personality and are not related to usoânu .
in his view , all of them were rather common financial and criminal interests , such as the supply of drugs from afghanistan .
meanwhile , the scandal surrounding the &quot; brotherly circle &quot; gregory leps-beloved singer-president of russia vladimir putin drew the attention of the kremlin .
naturally , we hope that we get from our american colleagues , partners for more detailed information , in connection with which such decision was taken , why is it in such lists have made , said the head of state &apos;s press-secretary dmitry peskov .
in any case , he is a citizen &apos;s ( leps ) .
as well as the interests of all citizens of the russian federation , its interests will be protected .
tony blair has said he will take advantage of the chance to return as prime minister of great britain , but acknowledges that the return is unlikely .
the night before the interview , on the fifth anniversary of the resignation , the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy .
since the resignation in june 2007 , after 10 years as leader , blair has largely avoided discussions of british politics , limiting most of their comments on foreign affairs and its role in the quartet of middle east peacemakers ambassador .
responding to a question whether he would return as prime minister , blair , according to the london evening standard , said : &quot; yes , of course , but it is unlikely to happen , so ... &quot;

british police hands over assange extradition notice
british police today handed a notice of surrender of wikileaks founder julian assange , who took refuge in the embassy of ecuador in london and asked for asylum .
the scotland yard said they handed a 40-year-old australian &quot; official demand to surrender with a demand to come to the police station , adding that in case of failure to comply with this requirement , it will continue to be subject to arrest .
assange faces extradition to sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted his possibilities in accordance with british law , when the supreme court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month .
fearing that the united states stockholm , 19 june , he took refuge in the embassy of ecuador in london , this south american country have asked for political asylum .
scotland yard &quot; 40-year-old man presented a formal request to surrender , which obliged it to come to the police station on the day and time of our choosing , &quot; said the spokesman .
he continues to violate bail conditions .
the embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the notification to the police .
assange feared that he would be extradited from sweden to the united states for making it possible accusations of spying following the publication of more than 250000 u.s. diplomatic cables on acting against secrecy website wikileaks .
senčin novel is now in paris at the presentation of his novel &quot; eltyševy &quot; , translated into french .
we remind that the novel was a finalist for four awards : &quot; yasnaya polyana &quot; , &quot; russian booker &quot; , &quot; national bestseller &quot; and &quot; the big book &quot; .
and last year the author for this book was awarded the prize of the government of the russian federation in the field of culture .
roman senčin-the undoubted leader in the generation of the current tridcatiletnih and the 40-year-old fiction writers .
virtually every publication of its rigid , built on modern life material short stories and novellas is a hot controversy among critics of the most different directions .
it can be argued that the collected articles about prose and journalism senchina , reviews of his book and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of russian literature since the late 1990 &apos; s to early 2010 &apos; s .
in discussions about the works of &quot; one of the most controversial contemporary writers &quot; , according to critic sergei Čuprinina , for the most part , is that the participants understand by the word &quot; literature &quot; how they see the present and the future not only of our literature and life .
unfortunately , the books are not allowed to include most of the articles and reviews of regional media and the blogosphere .
research and review articles are , as a rule , the reduction in the sections &quot; paragraphs . &quot;
snoudena can interrogate in russia
ex-employee of the american secret services edward snowden is not likely to travel outside russia to testify in cases of wiretapping telephone conversations of german chancellor angela merkel .
as told to interfax on friday , a source familiar with the situation , american can answer the questions raised by the representatives of the general prosecutor &apos;s office of germany , in writing or in person in russia .
check out edward snoudena outside russia is practically excluded .
&quot; in this case it will lose refugee status and may be extradited to washington united states allies , &quot; the spokesman said .
&quot; however , in principle , the german prosecutor &apos;s office in russia might send their representatives or send written questions to snoudenu , &quot; said the source , adding that the issue should be worked out at the inter-state level .
previously member of the german bundestag hans-christian Štrebele said that edward snowden was prepared to give evidence in the case of the american secret services talks german chancellor .
snowden was prepared to give evidence to the german law enforcement authorities either in moscow or in germany .
ex-cia officer made it clear that he knows a great deal .
despite the fact that the united states has blocked all the nsa &apos;s movement , snowden was prepared to come to germany .
but for this purpose it is necessary to clearly define all terms and conditions of his arrival , &quot; said Štrebele tv channel euronews .
lawyer anatoly kucherena snoudena , commenting on the statement of source of interfax , stated that his client would cooperate with german investigators , but when and how-will solve itself .
citizen of united states edward snowden , who worked at the national security agency ( nsa ) of the united states and the cia , fled to hong kong s.a.r. in may 2013 , after which revealed information about undercover operations special services the united states surveillance on the internet .
snowden was flying via moscow transit , but was unable to leave the airport because the united states authorities revoked his passport , claiming him serious charges in absentia , and prior to august remained in the transit zone of the airport &quot; sheremetyevo &quot; .
the first of august snowden received a document for temporary asylum in russia for a year and on the same day left sheremetyevo airport .
anatoly kucherena american lawyer yesterday said his client took a job at a major russian company &quot; .
about nsa surveillance for angela merkel last week , german media reported .
according to the journalists , calls chancellor americans began play in 2002 .
tracking station allegedly was in the united states embassy in berlin .
german authorities after publishing this information stated that surveillance of merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of germany .

children should learn the myths and legends as a &quot; model way of life , &quot; says the author .
tales of the torah could show that &quot; brute force can &apos;t win a sophisticated trick &quot; , and the legend of king arthur , show how important it is to have a dream .
saying that many myths would prove to be &quot; too wild , too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools , crossley-holland stands for &quot; careful selection &quot; of age-appropriate texts .
&quot; i think it &apos;s wonderful that america &apos;s myths and folklore are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i advocated the introduction of a training programme for twenty years .
he added that &quot; the excessive moralizing &quot; authors and teachers gets interest &quot; in children , and main ideas &quot; sublimated &quot; into fascinating stories .
crossley-holland , who translated beowulf in the anglo-saxon language , and also wrote a collection of norwegian myths &quot; to publishers penguin and british folk tales » , said : « you can of course be the intention , but you better keep them to yourself .
perhaps the biggest difference between adult author writing for adults , and adults author writing for children was the need to feel some hope .
not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending , but you should have an innate understanding of good and evil .
and it should be sublimirovano ; revealed through the story , and not clearly formulated .
the old principle : show , don &apos;t tell .
goldman sachs has warned about the risks for the russian economy
goldman sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of the fragile economic growth in russia .
it is above all the crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass redundancy of employees .
our main concern now is not that growth slowed , but rather , the structure of this growth .
in recent times it is completely driven by consumption , which is almost the highest speed , &quot; said the chief economist at goldman sachs in russia under clemens , representing today the quarterly report of investbank on the russian economy .
now the nominal wage growth in russia-approximately 10 % .
with inflation at 6 percent , he will be able to provide future consumer demand around at the current level , at goldman sachs .
but russian companies &apos; profitability falls , so most likely they would undertake optimized personnel costs .
today , we see a significant increase in the share of wages in gdp : if wages grow at 10 % , the gdp by only 2 % , explained mr. box .
the company faced a decline in roi .
if it doesn &apos;t grow , it could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment .
do not raise the salaries of russian business can &apos;t , commented barclays capital &apos;s chief economist for russia and the cis vladimir pantûšin .
unemployment is near historical lows , competition for workers is high .
to lure staff from or keep current , employers have to raise salaries .
consumption in russia supported by the land-owning elite and very rapid growth in consumer lending .
according to the graph , because of the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country , this type of lending is not .
&quot; the benefit to the economy from rising consumer lending we have seen no money does not diverge on the economy , and are returning to the same banks in the form of interest payments , &quot; said the economist .
but the problem lies elsewhere-at goldman sachs expect growth delay on unsecured loans .
they are mostly poor people who have nothing to offer as security .
interest on such loans are high .
as a result , they often do not return , &quot; said mr. box .
so the second threat to economic growth in russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans .
director of the institute of economics banking vasily solodkov now sees signs of a looming banking crisis .
small credit institutions , not having access to low-cost resources , which have state-owned banks were forced to raise funds of high-interest .
in response , state banks went on the warpath and began lowering interest rates , the economist continued .
small credit institutions may not grant loans under the same interest , otherwise they will have a negative margin percentage .
if the banks do not desist from dumping , russia may face a full-fledged banking crisis , said vasily solodkov .
disbarment of some banks in recent weeks , the economist believes the harbinger of mass collapse .
&quot; the state banks not cope with such a situation : deposit insurance system originally was not designed for a systemic crisis , &quot; warned the head of the institute .
but increases in consumption slows and the crisis of non-payments , believed to be in the investbanke , due to the non-indexation of salaries of civil servants and the military , embedded in the current version of the draft budget .
partial impact on consumption would be reduced by freezing tariffs of natural monopolies ( and , consequently , the reduction of inflation ) .
but only partially : if the investment does not grow ( a prerequisite to that yet-see help ) , consumption growth will still slow , sure goldman sachs .
vladimir pantûšin from barclays capital sees no conditions for the worst case scenarios .
&quot; the main risk is the continued drop in oil prices , &quot; he said .
according to him , russia &apos;s economy will shrink if oil prices below $ 90 / bbl .
at goldman sachs also noted that the central bank has not cut interest rates in the economy .
paradoxical painting : inflation has fallen , and banks are raising rates .
this may mean that they did not believe the central bank has advertised the transition to inflation targeting , &quot; said clemens graph .
the central bank &apos;s interest rate policy is not affected by the market rates , affects only the interbank lending rates .
&quot; for the central bank &apos;s collapse all hopes , &quot; praised clemens graph .
money earned at auctions of securities , banks use not for lending to the economy , and to manage their liquidity
as soon as the reduced rate , immediately change the exchange rate , it means , that means trying to get away from speculation against the ruble .
&quot; sooner or later the central bank understands that this strategy does not work , &quot; said mr graph and recalled that let the rouble in &quot; free floating &quot; state plans by the end of 2015 .
but you will have to either do it before , either to raise the key rate of the central bank ( 5.5 % ) , he said .
in his assessment , the ruble now artificially overvalued by 10 % .
only one road-ruble weakening , the expert concluded .
but if the central bank zaronit in finansistah at least a shadow of doubt that the elimination of foreign exchange corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble , it may bring down the dollar much stronger .
snowden has agreed to give evidence of merkel
member of the bundestag hans-christian Štrebele , met in moscow with edward snoudenom .
during the meeting , there was discussion whether snowden to be interrogated as a witness in the case of germany , the prosecutor general &apos;s office on possible wiretapping of phone german chancellor specslcužbami united states .
snowden has expressed readiness to provide the necessary evidence .
the meeting could take place either in moscow or in germany .
he made it clear , &quot; said hans-christian Štrebele-that knows very much .
and despite the fact that the national security agency headed by keith alexander has blocked all his movement , snowden was prepared to come to germany .
however , you must first clearly define all terms and conditions of his arrival . .
meanwhile , us lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding spyware united states .
the senate intelligence committee yesterday approved a bill introducing further restrictions on the activities of the american office of electronic intelligence .
faa : airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft ( but not calls from a mobile phone ) &quot;
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music , but don &apos;t talk on cell phones , according to a long-awaited new guidelines issued thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect immediate changes will occur .
how quickly such a change is implemented , will vary depending on the airline , the faa administrator michael huerta said at a press conference .
airlines will have to show the fÃo , as their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their textbooks for members of the flight crew and the rules for the installation of devices to meet the new guidelines .
the faa stated that it had already received from certain airlines plans to increase the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes .
delta and jetblue were among airlines that have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the state of the plan we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the faa said .
currently , passengers are required to turn off its smartphones , tablets and other devices , as soon as the aircraft door is closed .
they should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10000 ft and captain will not give the go-ahead .
passengers must turn off their equipment again when the aircraft is reduced for landing , and not include them until the plane is on the ground .
in accordance with the new guidelines , the airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference could allow passengers to use these devices during take-off , landing and taxiing , the faa said .
most new airliners and other planes , modified so that passengers can use wi-fi at high altitudes , is expected to meet these criteria .
laura glejding , president of the association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; the new policy will be safely implemented ( and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this ) , it will be a win-win option &quot; , said glejding .
we frankly tired of feel the duty to school &quot; when it comes to this matter .
but the connection to the internet to surf , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at altitudes of less than 10000 feet , the agency reported .
passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices in airplane mode .
so , still no &quot; words with friends &quot; -intellectual internet games , in which the actor alec baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011 , when there was the sensational case : the actor was removed from an american airlines for refusing to turn the device off at the time when the aircraft was at the gate .
and heavier devices such as laptops , you &apos;ll still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment , since they could injure someone if it will fly around the cabin .
calls from a mobile phone in flight also will continue to be banned .
the regulatory authority for phone calls belong to the federal communications commission , not the faa .
the faa might lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
last month , mark rozenker of the national transportation safety board , a national expert on the safety of the transport of cbs news , said that cell phones are still considered risky .
&quot; phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially interfere with the navigation devices , but we know thanks to the fcc that they can interfere with cell towers , when the plane is in the air , &quot; said rozenker .
industry advisory committee , established by the faa to study the issue , recommended last month that the government allowed greater use of personal electronic devices .
pressure mounted in recent years on faa to ease restrictions on their use .
critics such as democratic senator from missouri , claire makkaskil , argue that there is no compelling reasons for bans related to security .
the restrictions also becomes more difficult to achieve , because applying the devices became ubiquitous .
some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions turn off your device .
the faa began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 , in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment , when passengers began to carry fm radio receivers — high-tech gadgets .
new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they also developed and approved by the faa as resistant to electronic interference .
airlines offer passengers using wi-fi at cruising altitude for several years .
aircraft , modified for wi-fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of ships adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines , said worth .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit radio signals much lower power than previous generations of devices .
devices for reading electronic books , for example , emit only minimal signals when the pages .
but the signals become stronger when the device downloaded or send data .
among those who sought to easing restrictions on use of electronic devices by passengers , was the company amazon.com .
in 2011 , the company loaded up a airliner device for reading electronic books kindle and flew it to check for problems , but never found them .
the faa advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices of any risk .
douglas kidd from the national association of air passengers stated that he considers the interference from devices , real , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only isolated reports of pilots , confirming what devices can cause interference to aircraft systems , and most of these are very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa allowed pilots to require passengers to turn off the device during instrument landings under conditions of limited visibility .
a group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed the changes , calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection , &quot; said roger dow , ceo united states tourist association .
vilnius suspects moscow of attempting to defame the lithuanian president
russia intends to implement informational provocation against the dignitaries of lithuania and the eastern partnership countries-such a statement the agency bns did in the department of state security directorate ( vsd ) .
this information is published on the portal delfi .
according to the report , in particular moscow is going to &quot; make &quot; the lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in russian from dealing with facts from the biography of the lithuanian leader .
according to the security services , the preparation of an information attack leads the department review of public management processes of the presidential administration of russia for interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries .
the structure is headed by eugene umerenkov , who visited lithuania and took part in the congress of the people &apos;s party .
also part of the operation is a member of the department v. smirnov .
according to the secret service , smirnov , under the guise of scientific work of until the end of 2012 , regularly travelled to lithuania and was in contact with local politicians , political scientists and media representatives .
now , smirnov denied entry into the country .
on the eve of the lithuanian president grybauskaite stated that knows about her informatake .
in her opinion , the main reason is the successful presidency of the eu council of lithuania and &quot; pushing the country to energy independence . &quot;
lithuanian leader previously had criticized the actions of the russian authorities .
she stated that in the kremlin to lithuania are &quot; out of respect &quot; .
in addition , grybauskaite accused the head of the russian federation vladimir putin to the nomination to &quot; alone &quot; .
as we have informed , in september and consumer rights suspended the importation of &quot; dairy products will face &quot; in russia .
it was reported that the quality of the product does not correspond to the sanitary-epidemiological norms .
the lithuanian leader then said that if russia does not withdraw the ban , the government must prepare a request to the wto .
new antinikotinovaâ vaccine can prevent the process of smoking pleasure
scientists have developed a antinikotinovuû vaccine , which could deprive the cigarette smoking pleasure .
one dose of vaccine to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life .
further tests before the start of the trials , which will take several years , but professor ronald crystal city from the medical college of cornell in new york said that the first results are encouraging .
&quot; we very much hope that such a strategy is the use of vaccines might finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit , having tried all of the methods available on the market today , but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern tools , &quot; said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the production of antinikotinovyh antibodies .
virus selectively infects cells of the liver , which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies .
antibodies are hunted down any molecules of nicotine in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain , preventing a smoker a nicotine hit .
the vaccinated mice , then gave nicotine to continue their normal activities .
and mouse , which did not give the vaccine , &quot; relaxed &quot; , and it is a sign that nicotine was up to their brains , the researchers said .
these experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccine have failed because they contained the antibody .
to maintain a high level of antibodies , shots have to do so often that they were expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower , because it makes the cells of the liver in the factory of antibodies .
professor crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe , it could be given to children before they have the urge to try a cigarette , preventing nicotine dependence .
but it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking .
&quot; they will know that if they start smoking again , they will not get the pleasure of nicotine vaccine , and this may help them to get rid of this habit , &quot; he said .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but cautioned that more research is needed .

frontier airlines will charge for carry-on luggage
frontier airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for what they carry hand baggage on board your flight .
frontier airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for carry-on luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although their ad on wednesday that passengers will be able to leave the bank .
the new fee for carry-on luggage apply to bags in the overhead luggage compartments , so small bags placed under the seat remain free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 , if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 if the travelling will be paid only once at the gate .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos;malley said that charge $ 100 to get passengers to take care about paying in advance .
&quot; we do not want to charge you for it , &quot; she said .
airlines have begun to charge a fee for the first and second bag , being turned into baggage , in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid these fees , fill as many as can , in your carry-on luggage , placed in the upper baggage compartments , which in these compartments are often not enough space .
taxes is one way to get passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;malley said that this new collection is really not for the sake of making money .
the fact of the matter is that the most loyal customers frontier state that find a place in the upper baggage compartment becomes harder .
passengers who bought tickets on the website of the airline , will not have to pay .
this means that one passenger in the queue at the frontier flight may be able to carry the bag for free , while a passenger in a queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag .
o &apos;malley said that the change in procedures on the website and at the check-in desks , frontier is intended to ensure that passengers are aware of the gathering before they are delivered to the boarding gate .
the new frontier for carry-on luggage fee will not be charged until the summer , although the date has not been established .
passengers often complain about the fees for baggage and other fees , but the airline of their love .
they claim that the handling of luggage costs money , and passengers who require this service should pay for it .
many on wall street believe adding luggage fees a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses .
however , most of them not related to fees for carry-on luggage .
spirit airlines inc. has introduced the first fee for carry-on luggage , three years ago , and another discounter allegiant air later followed suit .
the only other airline with such a hungarian wizz air airline consultant , said jay sorensen , who closely monitors supplemental fees .
in his assessment report of december 2011 , fee for carry-on luggage brings spirit $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , a former top manager of midwest airlines , recently flew the flight of spirit , and he was wondering what he finds at the gate , where the passengers would face with an unusual collection of spirit for carry-on luggage .
&quot; the landing was the most smooth of the ones that i &apos;ve seen in my career in airlines , he said .
i was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and fights at the gate .
the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and the landing took place rapidly .
frontier also follows the spirit of the $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
frontier said that passengers who get soda or juice may leave the bank and refill the coffee will be provided free of charge .
it will still be free to hand out water .
us airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in the 2008 year , but abandoned this after seven months , when the passengers began to complain and no other major airline has not followed suit .
frontier initiative on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers buy tickets directly from the airline , is the latest measure to attract customers to your web site .
airlines pay online-ticket sellers such as orbitz , from $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
this gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them , and does not apply to the online travel agency .
however , the frontier has gone further in this area .
in september , she began giving two times less frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency .
on wednesday she srezala premium number of miles to 25 percent of the miles traveled .
so , a trip to 1000 miles from the frontier , purchased from an online travel agency , would get 250 miles .
in addition , passengers can choose in advance only if they buy the tickets directly at the site of the frontier .

putin has made to impunity for his friend assad
and now , news from across the ocean , namely syria , where , as we know today , israel attacked the russian-made missiles , which reportedly were aimed at hezbollah .
today , syria has fulfilled the essential condition-1 november to destroy their chemical weapons .
this was done within the framework of the agreement reached under the mediation of russia and the united states are not allowed to conduct military operations to which they have come close this summer .
read more on weapons and on what it all means for the syrian president , tells our chief foreign correspondent richard engel .
washington said that the assad regime will be punished for it .
more than 1400 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in august from poison gas .
and the punishment has come .
but not in the form of u.s. bombing , and in the form of a transaction that a friend of assad-president vladimir putin .
syria abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year .
and today is an important milestone .
a team of international experts reported that syria has withdrawn from the alleged chemical weapons factory .
the longer-term task is heavy and the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components .
we understand that this is about a thousand tons .
earlier , washington said that assad &apos;s days are numbered .
i believe assad has to go .
the question is not whether this will happen , but when it will happen .
it is no longer legitimate and must go .
but assad remains .
and feels more confident .
its troops continue to use artillery , rockets , and napalm .
his opponents divided and poorly armed .
his people were forced to flee their homes , many starving .
some have to eat leaves and cats .
many believe that bashar al-assad has escaped punishment for mass murder .
the chemical weapons agreement called the success of diplomacy , inspectors awarded the nobel peace prize , and asad himself was impressed by a person ready to cooperate .
in washington today , the ambassador of united states in syria had to answer tough questions .
when a child dies of hunger , his mother is hardly easier from the fact that it was not killed by chemical weapons .
assad still holds .
and changing weapons on the power play .
tomic equates to 240 hours for extremist clip in social networks
leninsky city district court sentenced him to 240 hours of required works residents , who posted a video on the social network of extremist orientation , reported ria novosti news agency on friday , the spokesman of the regional court .
according to the court , in march 2013 , the man put on his page on the popular social network video recording , which added to the federal list of extremist materials .

parents of intersex children can choose &quot; indeterminate gender &quot;
germany became the first european country to recognize the third gender in children born with external sexual organs of intermediate type .
the newborn will no longer be required to attribute the male or female gender .
the new law does not require parents to call a floor , allowing parents to specify gender as &quot; indeterminate &quot; or &quot; unspecified &quot; in their birth certificates .
the purpose of the act was to remove pressure from the parents , who may take hasty decisions on operations for assigned sex , and oppose discrimination intersex people .
one interseksual ′ nyj people , according to the bbc , said many years later : &quot; i &apos;m not a man and not a woman .
i &apos;ll stay created by patchy product with bruises and scars .
about one in 2,000 children born each year , is neither a boy or a girl .
they and one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sex development &quot; is a collective term for people with abnormal chromosomes , gonadami ( ovaries or semennikami ) or unusually developed outer sexual organs .
wallis simpson was probably interseksualom .
gender identification is still poorly understood , most experts in the united states say that if sex cannot be determined , it is better to use all available information and assign it , than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before performing the operation , if it happens .
a new york psychiatrist , dr. jack drescher , who specializes in issues of gender identity , said that the new german law &quot; sounds like a good idea .
interseksual ′ nye kids create ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention , but most children do not have them , &quot; he said .
you can assign a gender without surgery and then see how evolving identity .
the science of how a child will develop a gender identity that is not too accurate .
no one can answer questions about why this is happening .
it &apos;s like a mystery about why people are gay .
the report sent to the european commission in 2011 , describes the intersex people as distinguished from transsexual or transgender , as their status is not related to gender , but to their biological structure , which is not exclusively a male or female and typical for both at the same time or not typical for any of them .
these characteristics may occur in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , distribution of hair , breasts and physique ; primary sexual characteristics , such as the reproductive organs and genitals , or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones .
the report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by interseksual ′ nye and transgender people in employment , as well as on the level of harassment , brutality and crimes motivated by prejudice .
boys with gender problems now have a special camp .
australia and nepal have allowed adults to male , female , or &quot; third gender &quot; in its official documents .
in june , the 52-year-old australian resident norrie may-welby became the first man in the world , recognized the &quot; genderless &quot; , defended in court the right to maintain &quot; an unspecified &quot; sexual status for life .
according to the ministry of the interior , in german passports will be the third designation in addition to m and f-x , that is , interseksual ′ nyj .
in neighbouring france , gender issues still cause controversy , according to a news release on the channel france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of lawmakers from france , this marked the catholic countries , have signed a petition of &quot; gender theory &quot; from school textbooks .
american web site catholic online also expressed his disagreement with german law , writing that &quot; in a situation where the world is drawn to a new state where sex is a matter of choice , and sexual activity — no , we turn the two pillars of civilization .
one mother of a newborn child from maryland also said the web site baby zone , that she would prefer that children have sex at birth .
&quot; hard enough to raise a child and without additional restrictions , especially if you don &apos;t know the sex of their child , &quot; she said the web site for parents .
children need stability and confidence .
historically , children born with male and female sexual organs , called hermaphroditic — named the beautiful greek god who possessed characteristics of both sexes .
and even just ten years ago , the medical community reacted gender as a worksheet where you can all erase , and then again to draw .
but now many have challenged the ethical grounds for surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice , not knowing how the child will be assigned to take the floor when she grows up .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century it was called &quot; urgent psychiatric case &quot; , said drescher .
when such children were born , you were not a psychiatrist — you call the surgeon .
the dominant theory about how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type was proposed by dr. john money of johns hopkins university , who believed that gender is easy to change .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and claimed that the environmental signals , including social-how parents raise their children , interact with genes and hormones of the child when determining whether a person is male or female .
but in one case , 1966 , known as the &quot; john / joan &quot; , his theories have come under question .
he advised parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during circumcision , negligent completely neutered the child by removing his testicles , and raise him as a girl .
mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition , but this was not the case , &quot; said drescher .
when he was about 15 years old , he became again a boy and married a woman .
but in the 38 years he had committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors still use this model .
but in the 1990 &apos; s , with the advent of the internet , the survivors of the sex-change operation , have declared themselves &quot; dissatisfied with the result . &quot;
such was the case of jim bruce , 36-year-old writer from montana , who was born with male xy chromosomes , but this intermediate type .
doctors could not determine precisely whether a large clitoris or small penis , and were convinced that he would never be able to live a full life &quot; men .
so shortly after its birth in 1976 , external genitals and testes of bruce were surgically removed , and he was raised as a girl .
he began giving female hormones at the age of 12 years .
&quot; i knew that i &apos;m not a girl , &quot; he told abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was very difficult to ask questions .
in the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty .
but being in a depression , and realizing that something is wrong , he requested medical documentation .
what he learned was devastating .
i was sterilized at birth , and no one ever told me about it .
bruce was born with impaired sexual development , which did not allow his body to produce sufficient testosterone for normal development of the genitals .
after learning the truth , he again became a man , getting injections of testosterone and removing their breasts .
the operation made him sterile .
today he defends others in an organization called interface project , trying to bring back to normal the perception of people with interseksual ′ nost ′ û .
but ann tèmar-mattis , executive director of the california-based legal association advocates for informed choice , concerned that german law induces to navešivaniû labels and stigma . &quot;
many activists are concerned that german law would encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give your child an indeterminate sex &quot; , she said .
we are afraid that it will promote the intervention .
we believe that it is better to assign male or female gender , and then wait .
but we haven &apos;t seen how it will manifest itself , so all we can do is speculate .
tèmar-mattis said that her organization supported the australian law because &quot; it allows adults to make a choice in favor of a third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions regarding formal sex , she says .
german law requires its assignment at birth .
this battle , in which young children should not at this stage .
when they grow up , they can make decisions about your own body .
but dr. arlene baratz , a radiologist mammologist from pittsburgh , which has a daughter with sexual development and to help hundreds of other people in a support group , said that german law would support &quot; of both parents and children .
daughter of abraham baratz , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but it is a violation of sexual development , entitled &quot; complete androgen insensitivity syndrome .
because of its androgen receptors do not work correctly , kathy developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but there is no uterus and ovaries .
now , at 29 years old , katie is married and runs a residency in child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
despite the fact that she was infertile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy .
&quot; the law gives parents time to not to take hasty decisions themselves , &quot; said baratz .
he gives them the time to do some research and understand the situation , as well as the amount of time before they write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; .
in this case you order — grow the child like a child .
you have a wonderful child , and you feel the joy .
we don &apos;t need to rush to do the operation , which is irreversible .
&quot; it allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents , because they do not feel are right , she said .
in the end , the child decides to floor him or her more comfortable — and that &apos;s great .
it gives children the opportunity to decide on their own .

united states secretary of state john kerry acknowledged that data collection and 2nd american intelligence services sometimes &quot; went too far &quot; , however , the politician noted that appeared in the media information of 70 million people .
i assure you that innocent people in the process , were not injured , but an attempt to gather information .

i admit it , as acknowledged by the president. and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future , &quot; secretary of state .

the court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of stop-and-search &quot; in the new york police department
on thursday , the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed the execution of a court order requiring changes in stop-and-search &quot; of the new york police department , and removed the judge from the case .
the second circuit united states court of appeals stated that the decisions of the judges Širy scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city .
in august , a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how he performed a street detention and interrogation .
the city appealed the decision and order corrective measures , including the requirement to appoint a supervisor to help police office to change practice and associated training program .
on thursday the court of appeal heard arguments on a motion to suspend the case .
the court of appeal stated that the disqualification of a judge because she had violated the code of conduct for united states judges and not posčitalas ′ with the need to avoid demonstrating bias , in part because of a series of interviews in mass media and official statements , containing a public response to the criticism of the court .
the judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , was referring to blacks and latin americans on the &quot; stop-and-search &quot; .
it has appointed an external auditor to oversee important developments , which include the reform of policies , training and control , and decided to start a pilot program to test the docking on the body of the camcorder in the police stations , where most of the detentions .
in august , new york came to a decision to discontinue the practice of storing the names and addresses of people to whom were halted after police verification .
debate on the appeal of the city should be held after march 14 , 2014 years .
the tactics of &quot; stop and search &quot; was criticized by many advocates for civil rights .
&quot; stop search &quot; has been practiced for several decades in one form or another , however , the number of documented stops has increased dramatically during the administration of mayor michael bloomberg , an independent , in 2011 , the absolute record in 684330 people , most of them blacks and latinos .
in 2004 , the four men , all members of national minorities , filed a lawsuit a class action .
supporters of the changes in the &quot; stop-and-search &quot; in the new york police department say these changes will put an end to the unfair practice , would form a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement this practice .
opponents argue that the changes will lower the morale of the police , not the crime rate will lead to an unnecessary waste of money and will not solve a global problem demanding conditions in police custody due to reducing the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade .
the judge noted that it does not stop the practice of &quot; stop-and-search &quot; , which is consistent with the constitution , but changes the way new york police stops people .
azarov has promised ukrainians the collapse of commodity prices after the signing of the association with the european union
ukrainian prime minister mykola azarov is convinced that prices will drop significantly in the country after the country signed the association agreement with the european union .
he said this in the course of communication with readers of its page on facebook &quot; .
i can definitely say that the prices are determined by many factors , which include , among others , and customs charges .
so , after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the free trade area , the level of customs duties on imports from the eu will suffer significantly .
and this would mean that prices have to fall .
&quot; it is with respect to the goods that come from the eu countries , &quot; wrote the prime minister .
as regards the other goods , the impact of the agreement on prices would not be so direct , it is indirect .
however , there should not be a price increase .
therefore , messages on billboards that recently quite a lot have appeared in our country , that the association with the eu is rising , this is not true , or more precisely to say-not at all , &quot; he said .
a rescue package of $ 325 million for health tasmania
the federal government has insisted that a rescue package of $ 325 million for a weakened health system in tasmania will be supplemented by conditions which guarantee that the state government does not spend money wasted .
federal health minister tanya plibersek , announced that the commonwealth is taking &quot; urgent measures &quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state , higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system .
funding decision for four years , was made after consultations with the government , an independent mp andrew wilkie in tasmania .
&quot; the government has proposed a package of emergency relief measures , which , we believe , solves specific problems facing the state , &quot; said ms. plibersek .
a $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million on a blitz campaign to planned operations .
2600 more operations , including orthopedic and cataract operations , will help bridge the gap .
there is also money for clinics taking sick without an appointment , in hobart and launceston , in order to improve the quality of care after a hospital , training medical professionals , mental health services and the introduction of systems of personal electronic health records in local hospitals .
&quot; this investment will go to the best doctors of the realization of the ideas about how to better help the healthcare system of tasmania , &quot; said ms. plibersek .
the minister insisted that the tasmanian government will operate under strict accountability and responsibility .
the state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive funds of the commonwealth , and a monthly report about where he spends the extra money .
a three-person commission to make sure that staff provide services as efficiently as possible and more efficient .
mr. wilkie said today that $ 325 million will decide nothing , &quot; if they don &apos;t follow the real reform that will put health care tasmania to more sustainable basis &quot; .
however , he praised the government for its response to his request for immediate assistance with which he first wrote to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i hope that a package of federal aid will contribute significantly to the conclusion that the state health care system from critical condition , &quot; said mr. wilkie .
according to the state government , the additional sampling procedure substantially offset recent reductions .
but federal opposition health spokesman peter dutton believes that today &apos;s announcement is &quot; a decision similar to lejkoplastyrû .
&quot; the reason we are here is that the labor government of throwing up $ 430 million from the health care system , &quot; he told abc tv .
when the state government raises nearly half a billion dollars , and the commonwealth is investing 300 million , you cannot pretend that this is good news .
mr. dutton asked ms. plibersek guarantee that every dollar of the rescue package will not be spent on more bureaucracy .
scream voter obama
i voted for president obama , twice sharing the hope for change
he said that obama has allowed republican obstructionism to nullify the commendable efforts .
obstructionism cannot justify the problems with the web site of the reformed health care system , obama &apos;s drone attack
a memoir of the 2008 obama campaign , are a painful reminder of what might be
nathaniel p . morris , a second-year student at harvard medical school .
i read terribly sad book these days .
i thought that this book will inspire me in times of discouragement in the second year of medical school and will renew in me a sense of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; , and it is a memoir of barack obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign year .
the evening when i finish writing reports for my patients and lie down in bed , this book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people , and could capture the spirit of the speech .
electoral victory was impressive , and the leading news programs did pause to reflect on this historical moment .
my classmates were weeping with joy , and my parents were saving all of the newspapers that they could find .
the white house had come a young team strategists , and the nation was ready for change .
at the time of obama &apos;s inauguration in 2008 , his level of support was 82 % .
then i close the book .
back in the present is a rude awakening , as pulling out of the dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember the days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory , a sad reminder of lost opportunities .
in the years since i first dropped his ballot , change indeed occurred .
this was something i could not even imagine .
i give obama credit for its large and varied achievements , from the enactment of the affordable care to the withdrawal of our troops from iraq , repeal of the rule &quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell , &quot; the killing of osama bin laden .
moreover , i believe that the party obstructionism is blocking too many attempts to move our country forward : immigration reform , a choice of public health and the closure of the base at guantanamo bay , among others .
but after countless times when i was on the side of the obama administration , protecting her in front of colleagues and peers , i have run out explanations that i can provide .
i reached a point of political desperation .
the obstructionism of the republicans could not explain the permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drones strikes on innocent children in other countries .
he could not explain the data collection about the private lives of americans by the national security agency or prosecution of whistleblowers reveal the misdeeds of the government .
he could not explain the murder of u.s. citizen anwar al-awlaki , without charge or trial , or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during presidential campaigns .
he could not justify the conclusions of the report , which stated that ongoing white house effort to silence the media , are &quot; the most aggressive ... since the nixon administration .
and lately he cannot justify the fact that you cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on medical care available .
i don &apos;t know that i expected .
whether was 18 years of age , i understand that it may run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it ?
it is obvious that the work of elective office is not a predictable action programme , as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and such random events like the battle in newtown .
however , all of the examples above i see that they have largely been a choice of the administration .
and that is what worries me the most .
i voted for obama in 2012 , but not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a clear and tough alternative , it seemed that he was not in a position to decide on their own policies or views .
i thought that in his second term , obama , freed from the pressure of future elections , live up to the expectations that we have for such a long time .
however , when this week , obama &apos;s rating dropped below 45 % , to return in the year 2008 by the book became much more difficult .
it makes me yearn for the many promises that evaporated .
this week i read that part of the book , which describes how clinton dealt obama a high-profile defeat in the primary elections in pennsylvania .
at a meeting to review the reasons for the failure , he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain true to their purpose .
&quot; i want us to return to our appeal , &quot; he said .
&quot; we have to remember who we are . &quot;
five years on , mr president , and i completely agree with you .
opinions expressed in this commentary are solely the views of natanièlû morris .
in egypt accept the oath of the first freely elected president
mohammed morsi takes the oath of office , but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of political struggle in egypt .
islamist mohammed morsi promised &quot; new egypt &quot; , when brought to the oath of office , becoming the first freely elected president , hosni mubarak , who was overthrown 16 months ago .
at his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court president also became the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy in egypt for about 60 years ago .
he took the oath before 18 judges in black cloaks in the courthouse on the banks of the nile , built in the style of an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we aspire to a better future , new egypt and the second republic , &quot; morsi said during the ceremony , shown live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life is absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said 60-year-old morsi , an engineer with the american education of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was a proscribed organization , serving as a target for hard action of successive governments .
the building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police , when the motorcade arrived to russia shortly after 11 a.m. local time .
only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court building to welcome the new president , and , in contrast to the presidential pomp of mubarak , traffic was stopped for only a short time to skip his convoy on the normally busy road linking the city center with its southern suburbs .
although the mursi were ridiculed as the &quot; spare tire &quot; neharizmatičnoe &quot; brothers &quot; , his personal prestige has grown dramatically since its victory and friday &apos;s speech , in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only islamists but also to all those who want to bring to fruition the uprising 2011 year against authoritarian mubarak .
&quot; today egypt is civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; said morsi , dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie , the judges in obšitom wood-panelled hall , where he took the oath of office .
morsi later went to the university of cairo , where he was to pronounce his inaugural speech .
an official reception was provided him with an army orchestra , to perform the national anthem , in which he stood on the stand &quot; at attention &quot; .
attended military commander field marshal hussein tantawi .
his arrival was greeted by the slogan &quot; army and people — one arm &quot; , chanted hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university .
founded in 1908 as a bastion of secularism , the university of cairo in the 1970 &apos; s became the stronghold of the islamist student groups .
mursi took a symbolic oath of office friday in tahrir square , where the revolt ends mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and promised to return the power of the president , which his title was stripped by the military council that took the case of the ousted leader .
but by agreeing to take the official oath of office before the court , and not in front of the parliament , as is usual , it is the will of the military , and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue .
it occurred at tahrir square was filled with theatrical populist gestures .
the school called for more focus on math , spelling and grammar
school english literature courses will require that students study at least one play by shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic poetry and modern british fiction since 1914 .
on the exam will also feature &quot; extracurricular texts &quot; , to encourage more extensive reading .
combined course of english literature and language will be cancelled .
from 2015 onwards , students will be required to pass a language exam , with the insistent recommendations of choice of english literature as a separate exam .
the education department should tomorrow to release new curricula for english and mathematics — the first subjects , subjected to a radical revision .
he will make changes in the other majors the following year .
separately , the regulator ofqual exams will submit the revised structure for the high school exams , with the new system of ratings and less coursework .
speaking of summer , education minister michael gove said there was &quot; broad consensus that we need to reform our system of examinations to return public confidence , insisting that school exams will be &quot; more complex , more ambitious and more stringent .
studies show that english schools are giving less time math ( 116 hours per year , or three hours per week during the quarter ) than in most countries .
for comparison-the australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year , and students in singapore are approximately 138 hours .
while the formal requirement to devote more time in the calendar math will not , coalition sources said large-scale school-leaving examination in mathematics , combined with an increased factor of rankings likely will serve as an incentive for giving schools additional training on the subject .
the curriculum more attention will be paid to the real-life challenges , including financial mathematics .
football-the cause of discord ?
in the state duma under the &quot; open platform &quot; politicians and experts have talked about how to maintain national peace in russia .
among the proposals made and such : ban football in the north caucasus , because from this game are some scandals and discord .
the speaker of the russian state duma chairman reminded about recent events in birûleve and said that to reduce the &quot; degrees of tension in society &quot; policy and media should be correct in the statements .
perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with vladimir zhirinovsky , who is one of the tv shows threatened to encircle the caucasus barbed wire , if there do not want to limit the birth rate .
all the speakers talked about measures to regulate migration in cis countries and on measures to harmonize the relations between the peoples of russia , that the attached discussion &apos; confusion .
maxim grigoriev said that the events in birûleve- &quot; modeling conflict , which could have been predicted , &quot; but &quot; with these questions we have meet too many people and institutions &quot; , and seven childminding babe without eye .
the concept of multiculturalism , which for a long time against migrants was europe , according to obŝestvennika , failed , and we must find a way .
historian linda placed great hope in the new unified history textbook .
&quot; still it is necessary to create a guide to the history of the culture of the peoples of the country , to schoolchildren in tatarstan , knew that the people live in dagestan , and vice versa , &quot; he said .
gennady zyuganov has proposed to criminalise &quot; calling for the dismemberment of russia : &quot; if the united states said on the radio that it is necessary to give alaska to russia , then you would be arrested and 20 years in prison ! &quot;
vladimir zhirinovsky tried very hard not to incite &quot; .
as usual , in all he accused journalists who make patients and acute national problems on the public discussion : &quot; in the heat of the controversy knows what to say ! &quot;
the leader of the &quot; united russia &quot; vladimir vasiliev immediately advised reporters to &quot; charter &quot; and agree to keep conversations on this topic gently , and then the same commitment can take over and policy .
we have about 30 laws governing migration , and the procedure in general , said mr. vasiliev .
as an example , he cited a law that holds regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace within their territories .
but lyudmila andričenko of delight over this law is not divided : there is no &quot; clear ideas about the adaptation of migrants on its mechanisms and limits .
therefore , actors will interpret differently the scope of these powers .
in addition , the municipalities have no expertise required to deal with such complex issues , no tools and methodological recommendations , which they could use , the center does not give ...
the head of the duma committee for nationalities gadžimet safaraliev proposed the creation of a special agency with the formidable name of &quot; homeland security &quot; dealing with issues of national policy .
but valery tishkov , who in 90-th years headed a similar office , subsequently removed , objected .
at the federal level is enough to have a special person , &quot; minister without portfolio &quot; , that could be , if that .
&quot; we go over the edge , shells exploded nearby , it is very important to members of different ethnic groups and religions together to oppose provocations , and should get a decent support , &quot; said the representative of the roc relations with society vsevolod chaplin .
no neutrality of the state with respect to dangerous ideologies , religious including be , in his opinion , should not .
here oleg nilov led off the discussion in an unexpected direction : &quot; more talented people than in chechnya or dagestan , another check for you , but their push did not in that way , the wrong way , &quot; he said .
&quot; not that way &quot; is the development of football , &quot; the soccer player beat the crowds , the flags burned , the stones throw each other comrades .
maybe we need a football ?
is there another sport-rugby is called ...
&quot; they will not be equal in the world in the sport ! &quot; -ardently talked spravoross .

in yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands of the distinguished representatives of the moscow club-while playing for his local club .

recognition of the national security agency increased the paranoia of corporations with respect to the state of surveillance
on a warm afternoon in late august , the german police helicopter flew low over the united states consulate in frankfurt , germany &apos;s financial capital .
on the instructions of the federal service for protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , germany &apos;s internal intelligence service , his task was to take a picture of the roof of the building mission of the united states , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
german media say that the bfv was hoping to detect listening devices , antennas and those actions have led to negotiations between the united states and the german foreign office in berlin .
james clapper , the director of national intelligence , united states , in september again pledged that the united states does not use foreign intelligence &quot; for theft of trade secrets by foreign companies for the benefit of american companies to boost their international competitiveness or to increase their profits .
but since edward snowden was a contract employee , razoblačitelem , began publishing its trove of secret intelligence , united states , european governments and business leaders no longer unsure of whether to trust the director .
reports that the national security agency united states followed the brazilian oil company petrobras and has access to the data stored in cloud services united states suppliers , including google and yahoo , have raised the corporate paranoia caused by the surveillance state to new heights .
the last straw was the news that telephone was bugged by chancellor angela merkel , perhaps about ten years .
if the most influential person in europe may become a target , then , of course , are potential targets and business leaders .
snowden made it obvious the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the united states and companies .
i think it is likely that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany should wake up , &quot; said oliver grûn , president of association bitmi , which represents small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies are convinced that the united states now are almost the same risk as china , in the field of industrial espionage and data theft , according to a study published in july the consulting agency ey .
all documents disclosed by mr. snoudenom , however , so far , there has been no evidence that the united states passed on trade secrets foreign companies with their own companies .
politicians expressed concern that the eu lacks certain features in the field of information technology and the internet , and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the united states .
businessmen skeptical of this .
someone in the german parliament says that we must create the german google .
i can just close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; this is not an option , &quot; said plattner , president gassot german company-business software provider sap .
if there is a need for a strong european it industry , it was not worth allowing it to die more than 20 years ago .
all are subsidized in germany : from coal to automobiles and farmers .
all but the it industry .
however , the scope and the technical development of united states espionage agencies gained thanks to the revelations that the snoudena were a shock to some companies that used to be thought that the biggest risk of surveillance is china .
a big shift taking place in the cloud , where the heads of european companies better understand that the data stored in the united states , are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a study conducted by the trade association of the cloud security alliance , about 10 percent of its non-u.s. parties have abandoned plans to use the facilities in the united states after the revelations about the american provider of cloud-based software for data mining prism .
jim snejb , one of the executive directors of sap , said : &quot; we see that consumers are asking a new question , which arose a year ago , namely : where are my data and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction &quot; .
many german executives contend that the final allegations-this is just a confirmation of what they already knew : the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets , and therefore , this information must be protected at all costs .
what is economic espionage , is not surprising .
he always had been .
&quot; it was a subject of debate for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy , &quot; says kurt bock , chief executive officer of basf chemical company .
americans spy on us commercial and industrial level , and we are also spies on them , because it &apos;s in our national interest to protect our businesses .
corporate leaders generally don &apos;t like to brag about those responses that they have taken , as this may give an advantage to the enemy .
in large companies has long been understood that take the free usb flash drive at the show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least imprudent .
ulrich hackenberg , member of the board of directors of auto company volkswagen , said that for many years the standard practice is to collect mobile phones before the meetings of the board , so they could not be used as a listening device .
the federal office for the protection of the german constitution encourages managers to consider the use of simple prepaid cell phones during a trip abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones .
prepaid cell phones are released later .
however , there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche .
&quot; small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access , &quot; warns the report bfv .
united states warn their own companies on economic espionage from other countries .
national intelligence summary of the united states in february moved to france , along with russia and israel in the second number of offenders involved in hacking for economic intelligence , after china , according to the washington post .
member of the board of directors of the prestigious german company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the french have the worst of all .
bernard skarsini , the former head of the french agency dcri domestic intelligence , reportedly said in an interview this month : the services are well aware that all countries , even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism , to spy on its allies . &quot;
los angeles international airport was evacuated because of a fire in one of the terminals .

the icac decoding telephone conversations are conversations in august and september 2007 , between mr. obaid , mr. tripodi and steve this , senior officer , ministry of ports that came in after work , under the leadership of mr. obeid in the department of fisheries .
&quot; whether the issue discussed during these telephone conversations , the issue of development policy a commercial lease ? &quot; asked assistant commissioner anthony wiley mr. tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; replied mr. tripodi . —
i can &apos;t recall what was discussed , but it was definitely not that .
definitely not between me and mr. obaid .

problems associated with the illegal migrants in the region though take away .

the kenyan press is outraged by the provocative act media
&quot; this is a terrible place , and there is a reason for the question : what can prevent the destruction by the independence of the judiciary in the future ? &quot; , said the newspaper , calling the law unconstitutional .
&quot; this law is very severe and punitive , and we reject it , &quot; said cyrus kamau , managing director of capital group is the parent company of the capitalfm , which includes one of the most respected in kenya , the independent radio stations and news site .
he said the new court for the media &quot; will always be biased , because it is a continuation of the government &quot; , and the content and advertising restrictions affect kenya &apos;s position in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president will listen to us , and we urge him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies , he said .
according to the star newspaper , the new law essentially would allow the government &quot; to take the media death grip &quot; , but the standard said that democracy and freedom of expression in kenya &quot; had received a serious blow , &quot; and criticized the bill as &quot; draconian &quot; .
the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen the national security after the september attacks by muslim terrorists in the westgate shopping centre .
the kenyan media have caused anger of the authorities by broadcasting recordings of surveillance cameras , where troops were sent to the place of attack allegedly robbing road shopping center .
reaction from police chief david kimajo became the call two journalists and official media for questioning , although the call was canceled after mass protests .
under the new law , publishers may be fined up to 20 million kenya shillings , and individual journalists — up to one million additional risk be &quot; excluded from the lists , that is , get a ban on receiving official journalistic accreditation .
the court also has the right to confiscate the property of the infringer , if the fine is not paid .
according to the daily nation , &quot; even one fine enough to paralyse the work of the majority of fm radio stations .
she also reported that these measures can have a devastating effect on the so-called &quot; vibrant blogosphere &quot; kenya .
politicians understand that by forcing the media silence , they can do whatever they want with impunity .
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote journalist nation mutuma matthew , describing the kenyan media as a key source of checks-and-balances in public life .
&quot; their own desolate country policy and return us to our hunting and gathering , &quot; he wrote .

investigators check information about child abuse in regina
29 october media published reports that the teacher of one of the city of biisk in the kindergartens for the purpose of correction had locked the child in the cellar .
investigators revealed that all of the circumstances and the legal assessment of the actions of the staff of the kindergarten .
after accusing durnovkusii evgeniya vasileva spoke
evgeniya vasileva , to the person that almost a year focused on media attention , so far have not commented , numerous publications in press as of theft in the defense ministry , and about her own relationships with ex-defence minister anatoly serdyukov , its poetry and the predilection for the valuable things .
however , 1 november another case &quot; orange &quot; broke the silence .
in an interview to life news vasilyev said : &quot; initially , of course , was exactly the same : pull out of me any negative information about the former secretary of defense . &quot;
was blackmail , that i should give evidence , otherwise i would be sent to prison .
today , the threats ceased .
then we go to court , will prove his innocence .
we are confident in the victory at 100 per cent .
the interviews suggest that , perhaps , the most touched words vasiliev , that it doesn &apos;t matter .
probably refers to the statement by the official representative of rf ic , vladimir markin , that is in the collection of paintings , which collected another case &quot; orange &quot; , there are fakes .
among the seized assets , there are a number of paintings that hostess , confident in their profound knowledge of art , acquired as the masterpieces of world art .
however , easel , assigned to investigators after his arrest , these paintings , found that they didn &apos;t have any artistic value and , quite simply , are cheap fakes , &quot; said markin in early october .
some paintings , stolen from the ministry of defence .
then finally admitted that they are from the ministry of defense is not stolen , and was told that i have a bad taste .
who has the right to discuss my taste , discussing some personal moments ?
in my opinion , it &apos;s just a mess , &quot; said vasilyeva .
the question is whether she &apos;s guilty or in one of the 12-minute charges against her criminal episodes , vasilyev said : &quot; of course not .
recognize at all .
moreover , there is no damage to the russian federation , referred to .
just introduce people astray , that &apos;s all .
in addition , in response to today &apos;s announcement , the rf ic vasileva refuses to examine the materials of the criminal case , the lawyer for a specific extra said he and his client &quot; does not give the investigator to get acquainted with the materials of the case &quot; .
that led to the revelations under house arrest is still obŝavšejsâ with the press ?
perhaps , as a woman she could not not respond to the accusation in bad taste ?
or are journalists &quot; komsomolka &quot; , who claimed a couple of days ago that she &quot; fell into even greater trans under house arrest &quot; because of the news of anatoly serdyukov , reconciliation with his wife and his return to the fold of the family ?
famous military &quot; kp &quot; viktor baranets , in his article &quot; serdyukov returned to his wife ? &quot; wrote : &quot; investigators do not exclude the possibility that after such a shock , it may become more communicative during interrogations . &quot;
previously some accusations of illegal vasilieva real estate defense took over .

transport minister baroness kramer noted that the project &quot; will bring together britain &quot; .
scotland &apos;s transport minister keith brown said he was &quot; excited &quot; by the prospect of working on a plan with the british government .
the first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between london and the west midlands .
when the second phase is completed , the line will be laid in manchester and leeds .
in june , the government has revised the estimated cost of the construction of a high-speed rail line between london and the north of england from £ 32,7 up to £ 42,6 billion .
the british government , which is negotiating with transport scotland , commissioned hs2 ltd to consider further improvements in throughput and reducing travel time for northern england and scotland .
this should include the opportunity to overcome the route from glasgow and edinburgh to london in three hours or less .
baroness kramer said : &quot; our goal for the hs2-create a truly national network , which will make the uk and its cities closer together . &quot;
we develop hs2 because benefits it will bring , are enormous .
without it , we will face a crisis of capacity in our railway network .
but it is also about urban transport link with each other ; 18 cities across the uk , including glasgow and edinburgh , will be featured by hs2 .
scottish secretary alistair carmichael added : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland .
on behalf of the scottish executive keith brown appealed to mr. carmichael &quot; unequivocally &quot; to support the inclusion of scotland in hs2 .
mr brown said : &quot; high speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to scotland , but also adds to the economic weight of the arguments for scotland high-speed rail across the uk &quot; .
therefore , we are pleased to work in partnership with the british government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in scotland , creating benefits for all and the continuation of the glasgow-edinburgh railway line , which the scottish government is already planning .
i look forward to reviewing the results of the study with british ministers next year and jointly decide on the next steps .

sony is counting on a lower annual profit
japanese electronics maker sony corp. , after the previous quarter with a net loss of $ 19.3 billion yen , or $ 197 million , reduced its profit forecast for the current fiscal year .
sony &apos;s results for the period july to september 2013 , have been more disappointing than expected , due to the fall in demand for televisions , cameras and personal computers manufactured by japanese automaker .
sony &apos;s television business , in the second quarter that brought the company &apos;s first three years of operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the period , again fell to 9.3 billion yen operating loss .
japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing hard times , especially due to lower demand for tvs .
and while competitors are trying to seek a way out of a difficult situation , sony continues to focus on the consumer segment .
for example , one of the main rivals sony , panasonic corporation , shifts the emphasis on industrial components : here the company &apos;s sales are growing rapidly , especially from the automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies .
as a result , by the end of the financial year which will end in march 2014 , sony expects to get 179 billion yen operating profit expected earlier against 230 billion yen .
however , according to thomson reuters , analysts had expected that this figure will be much higher and will reach 221 billion yen .
in an effort to emerge from the crisis , sony expands its product line .
in the middle of this month was announced the start of sales of &quot; smart &quot; hours of japanese corporation with several trendy features that will eliminate the need for 100 times a day to get out of the pocket .

the agency &quot; rosbalt &quot; was deprived of the status of the media for using foul language
31 october , moscow city court decided to annul the license of the agency &quot; rosbalt &quot; , writes the &quot; ribbon &quot; .
the deprivation of the status of media agency insisted the roskomnadzor systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media .
in the process , created a bad precedent : the court decided to close the media , effectively denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments .
what is the &quot; rosbalt &quot;
jsc &quot; rosbalt news agency &quot; was established in st. petersburg in 2000 .
in subsequent years , the agency has opened a second office in moscow and a number of regional units .
the agency also has offices in the countries of the former ussr .
since 2001 , the &quot; rosbalt &quot; was developed and operated as a federal information-analytical agency .
by the mid-2000 &apos; s , the agency included in the list of most recognizable private internet media in russia .
the &quot; rosbalt &quot; has always been pretty specific niche : the exclusive agency &apos;s publications were ( and still are ) a note with a reference to sources in law enforcement .
talk of the next edition of the force structures have continued throughout the existence of the agency .
while the &quot; rosbalt &quot; possessed an extensive database of resources in various departments , in favor of such assumptions was that the project was headed by natalia chaplin-wife of victor Čerkesova .
the role of Čaplinoj in the &quot; rosbaltom &quot; to the end is not clear : most often it is referred to as the &quot; project manager &quot; .
the director-general of the agency is to larisa afonina , editor-in-chief-nikolay ulyanov .
recently , the &quot; rosbalt &quot; was not in the rankings-no federal mass media citation , nor in the audience .
in october , the agency took 25 among the russian media on the sites attendance version liveinternet .
according to the same average daily audience of liveinternet , rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors ( up to 500 thousand hits ) , monthly-about 3 million unique visitors .
among the most popular materials for the last five months-notes on the helplessness of the kremlin &apos;s relations with ukraine , the death of the artist group &quot; korol i shut &quot; , riots in the capital birûleve .
&quot; rosbalt &quot; conflict with roskomnadzor has commenced in july 2013 , when the amendments to the law on mass media , prohibiting journalists using foul language .
the office has found no language in the two published on the agency website videos ( &quot; dzhigit from krasnodar &quot; and &quot; pussy riot desecrated oil rigs &quot; ) .
further , parties described in different ways .
roskomnadzor based on found footage &quot; rosbalt &quot; accused of flagrant and systematic violation of the law on mass media and petitioned the court to take away the agency &apos;s license .
in &quot; rosbalte &quot; said that claims offices are illegal : first , the commercials were not drafting materials , secondly , obscene words in them , and , thirdly , immediately after warning videos have been removed from the site .
agency representatives have filed a claim in magistrate &apos;s court-roscom and when october 22 , 2013 year moscow city court took action roscom , consideration of these complaints have continued .
but 25 of the justice of the peace ruled in favor of the &quot; rosbalt &quot; : chief editor nikolai ulyanov was found guilty of violation of the code of administrative offences and fined 20 thousand rubles-10 thousand for each video .
obviously , this is predrešilo and the outcome of the hearing in mosgorsude-if you do not believe that the outcome could be a foregone conclusion even earlier .
on october 31 , the court decided to annul the registration certificate of the &quot; rosbalt &quot; , effectively depriving the agency of media .
it cannot be said that the &quot; rosbalt &quot; during the standoff remained in solitude .
the agency supported the deputies of the state duma ( a statement addressed to the head of roscom alexander zharov 10 october signed 26 deputies ; the document was filed at the initiative of the communist party ) .
improper closure said the head of the russian union of journalists , vsevolod bogdanov , chairman of the moscow union of journalists pavel gusev , head of the presidential human rights council mikhail fedotov .
moreover , according to bogdanov , the leadership even provided him with roscom any guarantee that to revoke the licence deal will not come .
trial over &quot; rosbaltom &quot; revealed , under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be media outlet in russia today-the big question .

want glowing in the dark ice cream ?
a british entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first light in the darkness of the ice cream using a jellyfish .
charlie francis used the fluorescent properties of marine animals to develop a food .
he came to this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish , and convinced the scientists in china are chemically recreated glowing protein .
ice cream reacts with the language of who it eats by raising the ph level of the protein and causing it to glow .
chris said that because the ice cream starts to glow when reacting to the heat of the mouth , this means that the more you licks , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , the founder of the company on production of ice-cream &quot; lizni me , i am delicious , &quot; says : &quot; this is an incredible thing , but still at a very early stage in terms of production , so for £ 200 you get about 2 g of substance . &quot;
protein that we use in ice cream , reacts with your tongue at neutral ph .
so when your mouth is warm protein , this will increase the ph level and the ice cream will start to glow .
we tested it over the past few months , and it seemed that the ideal would be to introduce it in halloween , because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect .
this is , perhaps , the most expensive ice cream that i did , because the luminescence of the medusa is four times more expensive than gold .
so each ball costs me about £ 140 .
but it is quite pleasant to the taste .
pilot charlie company , based in bristol , is famous for its unusual flavors , including beer , cheese , beef and taste of gold leaf .
but his next creation should be even more ambitious .
he said : &quot; i really want to make invisible ice cream . &quot;
it is by definition impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream , but i think we will find a way to do it .
ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of medusa , synthesized by chinese scientists

the eu is preparing measures to support ukraine in case of economic pressure russia
the european union has a contingency plan to provide ukraine with gas , as well as to reach an agreement with the imf on an emergency loan if russia would take any action in response to the possible signing of the agreement establishing an association between the eu and ukraine at vilnius summit .
negotiations are underway with the imf stand-by loan , while another eu official , directly involved in the negotiations , added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future .
besides a potential loan from imf ukraine can gain 610 million euros from the european union itself .
analysts interviewed by reuters , doubts that ukraine and the imf are able to overcome long-standing differences on the terms of the financing .
do not believe in the possibility of reforms needed for assistance , and international rating agency s &amp; p , ponizivšee on friday ukraine &apos;s sovereign rating by one notch to &quot; a- &quot; from &quot; b &quot; .
eu representatives , however , say that the imf could show flexibility in terms of crediting , taking into account the circumstances of ukraine .
in addition to the country &apos;s financial support plan , the eu has a backup option to provide ukraine with gas supply , the bulk of which now comes from russia .
perhaps it will gas from the &quot; nord stream &quot; or reverse from slovakia .
the latter , according to officials , is the most possible and acceptable way if russia &quot; isolates &quot; .
analysts believe that the way to reverse the supply to ukraine can be used only for a few weeks and probably would result in a reduction of supply in other regions .
&quot; between eu and ukraine held talks on how to create favourable conditions so that ukraine could import gas from other sources , rather than from russia , or from the same source , but on other routes , &quot; the source added .

syria has destroyed chemical weapons equipment
syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities , recognized the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
this first stage of disarmament damascus completed the day before the deadline .
up to 1 november , syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary installations designed for the production of chemical warfare agents , reports the bbc .
the destruction of stocks of chemical warfare agents or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014 .
according to the opcw , the poisons are in sealed vaults .
international inspectors went to syria after being on the outskirts of damascus on august 21 in the chemical attack died , according to the united states , more than 1400 people .
the main task of the inspectors , it was not time to lose-so as not to let the syrian authorities to make more chemical weapons and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munition .
these manufacturing facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their fixes .
next milestone-mid november : by this time , the opcw and the syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances .
there are a lot of issues .
where they will be destroyed ?
who will provide the equipment ?
all syrian statements will be scrutinized by western intelligence services .
they will readily recommend new sites to the inspectors to check if there are grounds to suspect that damascus is not fully candid .
united states believe that the attack was carried out by regular troops .
syria and russia have insisted that it is the work of syrian rebels .
the international community demanded that the syrian leadership-in accordance with the agreement reached under the mediation of russia , destroy or make inoperable the capability to produce bombs , poisonous gases and liquids and to fill the shells .
now that this stage is passed , the next step would be to destroy existing chemical weapons by the syrian army .
it is expected that the arsenal might be more than 1000 tons of toxic nerve agents , mustard gas blister and other illicit chemicals stored in several different places .
for its destruction , opcw and the syrian authorities have agreed on a schedule to start action-this has biweekly .
head of the opcw field operations jerry smith told the bbc that his inspectors &quot; personally oversaw the destruction of equipment &quot; .
&quot; they have no possibility to further manufacturing or mixing of chemical weapons , &quot; he said .
in a statement , the opcw said that inspectors visited 21 out of 23 sites in syria and have seen that plants bombs and poisons either destroyed or destroyed .
the remaining two objects too dangerous to carry out an inspection there , it says , but the equipment was transported from and retrieved by the opcw .
according to smith , the destruction of infrastructure for production of chemical weapons was a &quot; particularly difficult &quot; because the work had to be in a situation of continuing conflict .
in early october , the opcw has received the nobel peace prize , however , according to smith , the time celebrate the inspectors have not yet found-they were too busy working .
george kerevan : gap with europe gives scotland a selection
another day , another to intimidate people : on independence .
this time we have warned that an independent scotland would have to join the pan-european area of free movement , as a condition of eu membership .
preform stories about passport control in berwick and the border with barbed wire along hadrian &apos;s wall .
however , the newspaper pointed to the strathclyde possible economic benefits from more free movement to the rest of europe , though — that is predictable does not appear in the headers .
no one also not pointed out that eu countries spend a lot of time trying to rotate its formal rules as they are convenient .
since scotland is not included in the schengen area , continued non-compliance will be a cheap concession to brussels instead of what he really wanted from the scots .
so it &apos;s not a worthy story .
and so old , that it has turned into a fossil : the first time i heard &quot; duck &quot; that &quot; independence is passport control , at least 40 years ago .
and yet there is an interesting point , lost in the retelling of old tales .
why an independent scotland should execute orders in europe ?
why change the yoke of london jarmo brussels , especially now ?
here &apos;s the real news : the great european postwar plan to unite europe finally stalled .
with the evrokrizisom project &quot; europe &quot; is officially dead .
throughout the european union parties opposed to the eu or for the abolition of the euro as the single currency gaining strength .
even in germany , the party of evroskeptikov &quot; alternative for germany is founded only this year — appeared out of nowhere and got nearly five million votes in the september federal election , thereby effectively cutting free democrats ( similar to our &quot; liberal democrats &quot; ) of the bundestag .
always there was internal opposition plan create a federal europe .
nevertheless , the current economic crisis was a turning point .
the austerity measures imposed by berlin and the european central bank , and the fetters imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency , have led many people to believe that the project &quot; europe &quot; has gone too far .
the euro crisis a little due to the fact that national governments operate at excessive budget deficits , this was true only for greece .
actually evrosistema has blocked its members on exchange rates , favorable for german exporters , is that german politicians are determined to preserve .
without the possibility of devaluation of the south europe turns out to be a disadvantage on production capabilities compared to germany .
the only thing saving tool is salary and cut back on government spending that is actively supported .
current problems of budget and currency worth a deeper problem of productive abilities .
as a result of a set of measures to &quot; green &quot; energy , embedded brussels , is a cipher , which means subsidies to french and german energy companies at the expense of the consumer , is a european industry pays twice as much electricity and is four times more for gas than in the united states .
the paralizuûŝe adverse price conditions , as we have seen in grangemouth .
no freezing wages in the world will not stop the crushing victory of cheap shale gas united states over the european petrochemical industry .
as a result of the riot is brewing , especially in france , once the most fervent supporter of the eu .
after the war the french political elite consider the eu as a way to control germany and put paris on the same level with washington .
but berlin no longer needs in paris as in the receipt of political legitimacy , and has already imposed its own economic policy of europe , leaving behind a devastated economy in distress .
the result is right , the eu opposed marine le pen &apos;s party &quot; national front &quot; had just won a critical by-election , dropping the ruling party the socialists into third place .
the &quot; front &quot; is now the most popular party in france with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning british laborers that you cannot assume that the split among right-wing automatically would be in favor of the left .
what does le pen with his newfound popularity among the french of the white working class ?
she wants to use the elections to the eu next year to create a bloc in the european parliament against the eu and against the single currency .
if — and it is very likely-minded party against the eu will receive support in these elections , such a block would be able to dominate for the first time in the european parliament .
here &apos;s my opinion : soon the growing sentiment against the eu and against a single currency in europe will merge together to destroy the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it is something of a vague &quot; ( sovereign ) nations , which like general de gaulle .
germany and several dependent economies can preserve the euro , but france and southern europe will restore their own currencies .
i assume that the united kingdom therefore dissociated itself from the project , hoping to get closer to the united states .
however , the growing interest of washington to the pacific ocean indicates the likelihood that the united kingdom will remain out in the cold atlantic .
where this leaves scotland ?
we can choose to become a region ( in effect ) a small england .
or we can defend their own economic interests , which means , among other things , send to berlin and brussels to the dogs .
i suspect that scotland could succeed within a free european agreement , provided that we will keep its currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in nefederal ′ noj europe .
otherwise , we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of norway and the preservation of our economic independence .
the scottish national party in scotland is — ironically — the most successful political movement in europe against austerity measures , with an impressive majority in the 2011 year due to objections to proposed spending cuts ( and implemented ) , the labour chancellor of the exchequer alistair darlingom and subsequently by the tories and liberal democrats .
scotland it would be ludicrous to now vote for independence , only to adopt austerity measures imposed by berlin and brussels .

early puberty : aging before
an african-american and latina girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white contemporaries , studies show .
physical changes do not mean that puberty close
there is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals
experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the triggers of early puberty
the trend to early sexual maturity is not as pronounced in boys
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
whether the mother scared if her daughter begin to form the rudiments of breast and pubic hair grow in 7 or 8 years old ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , children &apos;s endocrinologist dr. paul kaplovitc explained that these early physical changes are quite common among american girls and are the new norm .
&quot; i spend a lot of time reassuring parents — typically does not mean fast full sexual maturity , &quot; said kaplovitc .
obvious signs of development , such as the growing breasts , pubic and axillary hair and body odor , appear earlier in girls .
but it was only a small shift in age at menarche ( first menstruation ) over the past four decades .
in the united states , the average age was 12.5 years and decreased compared to 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; after the breast begins to develop , is at least two to three years before the menarche , said kaplovitc , who is also author of the book &quot; early puberty in girls : how to cope with this common problem .
time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress .
discussion on what constitutes the actual onset of puberty , but is considered &quot; premature &quot; , where breast augmentation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the growth of up to 8 years .
in most cases , the process slows down or stops , the pediatrician can monitor carefully .
more rapid progression may be used as a basis for analyses by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems , such as tumors or cysts .
there are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent a further consequence : premature aging bones , which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth into adulthood .
recommendations on drug or hormone therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , level of development , growth and emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplovitc careful with medications , but acknowledges that &quot; suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings , that they differed from contemporaries .
another big problem is clear : parents just don &apos;t want to have their very young daughters were menstruating .
&quot; they are worried about the risk of pregnancy , or even how they will cope with questions of hygiene , &quot; said kaplovitc .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman daughters which menstruation started in 10 years .
although there have been signs and we were talking about menstruation , she was not emotionally ready .
she came home from school upset and frightened that it first among their friends .
there are many theories about the causes of early-publicized sexual maturation .
however , there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
boys like girls-puberty earlier .
kaplovitc claims that premise , which has the greatest weight , is the obesity epidemic .
in 2001 , he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years , that relates the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty .
other evidence supports this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country of african american and latin american girls generally reach puberty earlier than their white contemporaries .
there are various explanations .
around the world in early puberty , apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes .
still a mystery : while the boys have facial hair and pubic hair appear at younger ages , the trend towards early sexual maturation full not so expressed , as in girls .
other doctors participating in conference , affirmed aap complexity of the topic .
the appearance of pimples and pubic hair can be found even in infants and toddlers .
&quot; we have to be careful about how we define true puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a children &apos;s endocrinologist at children &apos;s hospital gorieb in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk with your child .
&quot; this could mean earlier than expected , the conversation , &quot; explained kaplovitc .
if you keep calm , your child usually will respond well .
girls blossom early , need confirmation that even when it occurs too early , this process is a normal part of life .

rbs dismissed two currency traders
the royal bank of scotland suspended two traders in his subdivision on currency operations , according to two people familiar with the situation , which is further proof that global audit regulators alleged manipulation in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigation of the world &apos;s largest financial market , the daily turnover amounting to $ 5.3 trillion .
these two will be the first trader rbs staff locked out during the unfolding investigation , which echoes a scandal related to manipulations with the interbank rate of libor .
refusing to comment on the suspension , the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; our ongoing investigation into the matter is ongoing , and we fully cooperate with the fca and other regulators , the bank reports two weeks ago .
last month , a knowledgeable person said that rbs sent his e-mail and instant messages that are received and sent his former trader , the british regulatory body is the office for control of financial activities ( fca ) .
this trader , richard asher , retired from rbs in 2010 and , as far as is known , he was granted leave on his current post of head of the european spot currency trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramčandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , went on vacation this week , while matt gardiner , a former senior foreign exchange trader at barclays and ubs , was removed from the standard chartered bank this week .
none of these traders had not been charged with any violations .
im contact group , mr. asher included bankers from barclays and citigroup , according to insiders .
ubs announced this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after the swiss regulator finma said he was investigating alleged manipulation in the currency market in several swiss banks .
at least six regulatory agencies in the world — the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , fca , united states department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority is considering the claim that bankers had conspired to influence the currency market .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also launched internal checks or received requests for information from regulators , said a person familiar with the situation .
banks are viewing instant messages and e-mails over several years in finding cases of offences .
the news jolted traders checks in the area of activity , as in recent years , one of the largest sources of income trading divisions of investment banks this year , however , had difficulties in view of the low volatility of exchange reduces the opportunities for resellers .
some bankers have tried to play down the seriousness of the situation , saying that extensive and liquid foreign exchange market virtually impossible to manipulate , but older traders say it is not always true .
according to the senior trader , despite the huge amount of daily trades in the forex market , liquidity fragmentation between the different trading platforms and increased use of banks of their internal platforms means that you can start to have an impact on the market for one low price .
this news came on the same day as the bank credit suisse announced that it had dismissed one of its traders stock trading division of the london stock exchange this week , after the latter has caused losses of nearly 6 million dollars at the end of last year .
the bank shall immediately notify the relevant authorities and was cooperating with its regulators .
&quot; we are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter has been localized , &quot; said credit suisse .

john kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the united states dropped spying unsuitable far »
john kerry demonstrated the mitigation program tracking united states protection tactics , making the unprecedented recognition that , in some cases , the united states dropped spying unsuitable . &quot;
the secretary also admitted that he was guilty , along with barack obama , that was on autopilot at the time of high-profile revelations of edward snoudena on nsa spying activities .
the government of the united states have put the leak at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies .
speaking via video link on the open government conference in london , mr kerry said : &quot; there is no doubt that the president and i , as well as other members of the government actually took some occurring things on autopilot because this possibility already existed — and during the second world war , and in the very difficult years of the cold war , and , of course , sept . 11 .
he then became the first senior member of the government of the united states to recognize that espionage united states has gone too far , but stressed that no one &apos;s rights were not violated .
he said : &quot; in some cases , this has gone far. unsuitable
and the president is determined to shed light on the matter and explain to people , and now conducts a careful analysis to ensure that there was a feeling of abuse .
i assure you , the abuse of innocent people in the process .
mr. kerry insisted , however , that the nsa had acted in good faith and that its tracking operation saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we are in a new world where people are willing to blow up himself .
in the world there is radical extremism , reckless and determined to kill people and blow up people and attack the government .
and if you were able to intercept it , stop it before it happens ?
we actually prevented the crash planes , explosions and assassinations , because we were able to learn about these plans in advance .
meanwhile , us lawmakers will travel to europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged espionage united states abroad and to convince europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism exercise with the united states , said the chairman of the senate &apos;s subcommittee on european affairs on thursday .
connecticut state senator chris murphy said he spoke with members of the european parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to end its participation in the anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration with surveillance by the national security agency .
&quot; for the national security interests of the united states really important , the europeans were our supporters on our common anti-terrorist efforts , &quot; said democrat murphy , who works in the post of the first term and chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on european affairs , in an interview from washington .
and i &apos;m going to europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , despite their anger over the nsa program .
news that the nsa had collected phone call records of millions in europe have worsened relations with some allies of the united states , although the head of the agency , said this week that they were inaccurate and reflect the lack of metadata gathered allies and that they shared with the united states .
in other razoblačeniâh were released by the snoudenom documents showing that the nsa monitored mobile phone german chancellor angela merkel , as well as the phone numbers of about 34 other world leaders .
director of national intelligence james clapper defended the spying activities against allied as necessary and said it is a common thing on both sides .
amid this hoopla murphy said his office will visit members of congress , which is expected to be held this year and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers .
the names of other participating lawmakers should be announced in the coming days .
according to him , the visit is still under development .
although murphy said that the aim of the visit is to foster better relations , he said that some degree of &quot; rigidity of well-meaning &quot; will also be shown .

when i was a kid , halloween was magical .
us with her sister was allowed to eat sweets , and stay up late to masquerade for our district .
now i more resemble a miser .
i have not called in the last two years , handing out candy to her apartment and , most likely , won &apos;t this year .
however , statistics show that i am a white crow to halloween .
according to the national retail federation , most americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate halloween this year , and will spend a total of 6,9 billion on candy , costumes and decorations .
the only thing i wait every halloween is trending .
the national retail federation predicts that the costumes will take $ 1.2 billion of 6,9 billion spent .
this year , at the height of fashion sexy inanimate objects .
women no longer have to be a sexual women professions ; they can also be sexy food , such as pizza , hamburgers or battle .
as for men , i think we will see many zombies due to the &quot; walking dead &quot; , and i am sure that astronauts in the style of the group daft punk get in our tapes instagram this year .
according to google , costumes , looking for more often than not , is a zombie , batman , pirates and witches .

it is about 600 million pounds of chocolate candy , candy , hershey milk duds , chewy candy bars and twizzlers clark bar .

moreover , we &apos;ll buy and-let us not deceive ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during halloween .
the only thing we do not want to use , is the candy in the shape of corn kernels ; and yet , according to the national confectioners association , nearly 35 million pounds of them sold under halloween .
that &apos;s roughly 9 billion individual corn kernels .
it &apos;s a mystery that i have yet to unravel .
nothing expresses the essence of halloween as the haunted house .
they have great names , such as &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is this the prison ) , &quot; howl and scream and house of shock .
moreover , according to the society of america haunts , in america there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses , generating about $ 500 million in revenue , as well as the stunning pictures , where you &apos;re almost peed my pants , that your friend has posted on facebook , but you can &apos;t hide , and then the guy who you like , see this photo and leaves a comment like &quot; cool facial expression &quot; .

the owners of shops in singapore are doing well , while the middle class has difficulty
in a pawn shop in bendemir shopping centre in singapore džanani amirthalinga lays the golden bracelet , ring and earrings , to pay for his daughter &apos;s schooling .
&quot; my husband and i just bought a house so all my money is invested there , &quot; said ms. amirthalinga .
although she earns $ 3,000 ( $ 2400 ) s per month as an administrator and her husband works too , the monthly income of the family is not enough , &quot; she said .
indeed , demand in various parts of south-east asia , where household debt is rising is that valuemax , where it holds its deal this week was the third by the pawnshop , registered on the stock exchange of singapore .
loan against jewellery is not just a quick way to get money ( s $ 1300 in the case of ms. amirthalinga ) , and almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
typically , pawn shops in singapore are an effective annual interest rate at 17 % , just above the 15.4 % offered at united overseas bank , the local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .
but pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks .
that &apos;s why millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawn shops as families feel pressure because of the rising cost of living and rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt .
after five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis , and cheap credit , were aggravated by the propensity of free monetary policy in developed economies , families with low and middle income countries are turning to pawnbrokers to compensate for the reduction in earnings as slowing the growth of their economies .
this week , standard poor &apos; s , the rating agency &amp; , indicated an increase in household leverage , largely due to the growth of the mortgage , as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
it said that malaysia , thailand and singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia topped the list with 80 % of gdp , compared to 60 % in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand this week barely emerged from technical recession .
thursday &apos;s data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand .
&quot; the bottom line is that with rising prices , people in the middle and lower parts &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking for ways to supplement their income , where only will be able to , &quot; said song seng wun , economist at cimb , malaysia &apos;s bank .
record high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the rush with which people put their personal belongings , because they use the opportunity to get the money for their family .
about 70 percent of singapore &apos;s things planted in 200 lombard paragraphs city states are gold .
the people saying : « gold price looks good , let &apos;s lay the gold chain and get it back in the next month .
in thailand , the largest operator of pawnshops easymoney observed increase in the number of customers who use its office in recent months , down to 20 % .
growth of the lombardnom business is such that valuemax , operator of bendemire and 15 other in singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring malaysia , where he has four stores , but also outside of asia , too , says li ching jeah , executive director valuemax .
the company will finance the expansion of 60 per cent , from s $ 66 million raised this week as a result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of singapore .
while some lenders have caused fire because of high interest rates , ms. jeah says that the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other creditors , it also does not increase the debt directly .
the customers provide the items they already own , and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households , she says .
bet is gaining greater public recognition as a means to obtain a short-term secured funding .
the lombards were not only the categories of people who are in dire financial straits .
rich in singapore also use office valuemax , laying the gold bars or rolex watches , which can produce up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash .
we see clients from all walks of life .
they include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short periods for commercial projects or investments , or small businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties , &quot; said ms. jeah .
sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

&quot; after the media reported the ministry of finance of the united states make leps in checklists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal syndicate &apos; fraternal circle &apos; , we viewed all database , but this group is not found , &quot; the spokesman said .

black box you have in the car ?
while american designers roads trying to find money to repair a scattering system , highway , many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box , neatly presented on the dashboard of your car .
these devices that keep track of every motorist proezžaemuû mile and transmitting this information to officials , are at the center of controversial attempts to modernize the outdated system of financing america &apos;s highways by planners in washington and the state .
usually a boring motorway planning arena suddenly sparked intense debate and alliances .
libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government the right to use the small boxes to keep track of how many miles you &apos;ve travelled and even , perhaps , of where you pass them , and then use this information when writing tax bills .
the tea party movement in shock .
the american civil liberties union is also deeply concerned about and raises a number of questions about privacy .
and while congress has so far failed to agree to continue or not , several states are not going to wait .
they ponder how over the next decade , you can go to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive .
thousands of motorists have already taken on testing these black boxes , some of which have the function of satellite tracking .
is it really necessary for our country .
&quot; this is not an issue on which we could be the right choice , &quot; said hasan ihrata , executive director of the association of governments of southern california , which is preparing plans to start tracking state authorities , travelled in every california motorist , by 2025 .
there will be changes in the way we pay these taxes .
the technology is already there .
this need is compounded by the lack of funds from the government &apos;s fund for the construction of highways financed by taxes that americans pay at the gas station .
americans are not buying as much gasoline as before .
cars drive more miles per gallon .
the federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon , not increased already 20 years old .
politicians do not want to raise the tax even one cent at high prices for gasoline .
&quot; a tax on gasoline just can &apos;t save , &quot; said lee mannič , an expert on transportation policy at the university of minnesota .
in his state of recently installed 500 surveillance devices on cars for testing mileage payment system .
&quot; this is the best alternative in the long term , &quot; he said .
zanudy call it the mileage custom board .
not surprisingly , this idea has attracted urban liberals , because taxes would change the nature of the trips to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
planning authorities in california are looking at the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious targets set by the laws of the state to combat global warming .
however , rep. bill shuster ( r-pa ) , chairman of the transportation committee , said he , too , sees this as the most viable long-term alternatives .
supporters of free-market reason foundation is also delighted by the fact that will make the drivers pay for every mile .
&quot; it &apos;s not just a tax that would go into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president of political affairs reason .
people just pay for what they get .
this movement is also supported by two former ministers of transport of the united states , which in 2011 , called for congress to move toward a mileage payment .
united states senate approved last year a pilot project worth 90 million dollars , which would have involved approximately 10000 cars .
however , leaders of the house of representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns of rural legislators , representing voters who in everyday life often had to travel many miles to get to work or to the city .
several states and cities , however , go down that path alone .
the greatest enthusiasm evident in oregon , where for the biggest experiment in the country shall be 5000 drivers .
these drivers will soon be paying staff for the miles mileage instead of gasoline tax .
in nevada the pilot project has been completed .
in new york , he is seen .
il try it on a limited basis involving the trucks .
and i-95 coalition , which includes the transportation departments of 17 states of the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , exploring how they can make these changes .
this concept has not received universal acceptance .
in nevada , where approximately 50 cars of volunteers have been recently equipped with these devices , drivers were worried that the government could track every their step .
&quot; concern about the &quot; big brother &quot; and things like this is a big problem , &quot; said khan gave , head of strategy and performance management in the department of transportation of the state of nevada .
this was not what people wanted .
when the tests were going full speed , the american civil liberties union office in nevada warned on its website : &quot; it is not difficult to turn this device into the devices fully tracking &quot; .
there is no need to create a huge , cumbersome technology infrastructure , which will inevitably expand to store records of daily movements of individual citizens .
nevada is one of the few states where are the difficult quest for low-cost technology that would have allowed state authorities to post the car travelled in miles , but no information about the place and the time .
if you can do it , said khan , society will feel more relaxed .
search for this technology have led some agency staff to a small young company in california called the true mileage .
originally this company was not engaged in assisting in the collection of taxes in the state .
she sought to enter the growing market of auto insurance , in which drivers pay based on mileage .
but the devices , which they test , attract designers , because they do not use gps and provide a limited amount of information , periodically downloaded using a modem .
&quot; people will be more likely to do this if you do not track their speed and track their location , &quot; said ryan morrison , executive director of the true mileage .
it was some big errors in some of the pilot programs in the state .
there are far less expensive and less intrusive ways of doing it .
in oregon , the designers are experimenting with providing drivers with various options .
they can choose the device with or without gps .
or they might just give up , having decided instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles , which are all residents of the state .
in other places , hoping to sell the idea cautious public , causing the device to do more , not less .
new york transport officials sought to develop a nalogooblagaûŝee device that will also accept payment for parking meters , pay as &quot; sparks &quot; insurance and collect data on the rate of pool in real-time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams .
&quot; motorists will involve benefits that they offer , &quot; said urban design .
some designers of transport systems , however , think about whether all the talk of mileage payment just a distracting factor .
in urban transport commission in the san francisco bay area officials say congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the construction of highway trust fund by raising taxes on gasoline .
an additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgery , when all you have to do is to take aspirin , &quot; said randy rentšler , director of the commission on legislation and public relations .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and a lot of other things .
the pope will announce the first cardinals francis in february
father francis will place a new cardinals in the catholic church for the first time in his life on february 22 , the vatican announced thursday .
the cardinals are the higher clergy in the catholic church after the pope , and they elect popes , so that francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will be involved in selecting his successor .
there are currently 201 cardinal .
however , after reaching the age of 80 a cardinal he can no longer take part in the election of the pope is the prerogative of the 120 cardinal electors .
in announcing the news , vatican spokesman father federico lombardi said that prior to the ceremony , the sun will be a collection of all the current cardinals , known as a consistory .
&quot; dad francis decided to inform his decision to convene a consistory in february in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world , &quot; said lombardi .
jack valero , of the &quot; catholic vote &quot; said that by february , the number of cardinal electors may decrease .
he said he usually dad calling as many cardinals , as necessary , to bring the number of cardinal electors to 120 , as well as many cardinals over age 80 years , how much he likes .
consistory in next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of francis in march this year , according to valero .
at the moment there is a bias in favour of europe and particularly in favor of italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope appointed cardinals from other regions of the world in order to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
in south america live forty percent of catholics , but they represented a negligible number of cardinals .
it will also be the first selected the cardinals since the formation of the council of cardinals francis — a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the church .
in the past , dad decided independently .
&quot; now , francis chose the eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said that &quot; it is possible &quot; that francis would turn to the cardinals for advice .
but we have not been in this situation before-all this for us for the first time .
valero said the pope usually erected in the post of cardinal bishops of large parishes , but francis &apos; full of surprises — so we don &apos;t know whom he will name .

tax for foreign property owners , the london bubble bursts
the treasury has complied with the preliminary assessment of the measures on capital gains tax , but is awaiting a final decision from mr. osbourne , in the budget of the 2012 year introduced rate of state fee in the amount of 7 % for homes costing more than £ 2 million and annual payments for customers who choose to own houses in the partnership , and not as individuals .
currently stamp duty for residential real estate in the city of westminster , kensington and chelsea , which stood at 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 financial year already exceeds the total for northern ireland , wales , scotland , north-east , north-west , yorkshire and hamberu combined .
mr cook said : &quot; after the increase of the registration fee on expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against evasion is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued , irrespective of the impact outdated municipal tax system &quot; .
&quot; but this move may cause some foreign investors are reluctant to buy a property in london or the current owners don &apos;t want to sell it , &quot; he added .
the cost of a first-class real estate-top 5-10 % of the market for housing costs — in the affluent southwest london &apos;s zone , which stretches from fulham , wimbledon has grown to a record 11.8 percent over the past year .
according to the research company savills , prices in central london have continued to show steady growth of 5.6 % in annual terms , but they are overshadowed by actively developing the &quot; domestic market &quot; with a surge in prices in the south west , in the north ( 7.4 % ) and in the east ( 6.5 % ) the city .
a regular meeting of the association of machine-builders of the tyumen region was held on the basis of Âlutorovskogo of the automobile plant .
the event was the presentation of the new line on manufacture of electric welding tubes from stainless steel .
according to the commercial director of the company in 2011 , gribanov denis , with the advent of the new owner of a marketing study to examine the market for steel structures in the tyumen region .
it turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of welded pipes per month .
after that it was decided to change the profile of the plant and the installation of the equipment for their production .
this year shipped more than 7 thousand tons of production .
investments in plant amounted to more than 120 million usd-lei , said denis gribanov .
in october launched a new mill , that allows to increase the range .
are manufactured at the plant as a shallow profile pipe , which is used for tep-personal , small forms of construction and furniture industries , and large-for the construction industry .
we plan to produce 50 thousand tons of production per year , that would be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the tyumen region .
despite the transition to the next activity , number of employees in the company not reduced-now she is 157 people in plans for the purchase of new equipment to increase staff more than 50 workers .
the company is retraining and the necessary experts are chosen from existing .
in the future it is planned to introduce a new slitting plant up to five millimetres thick steel that will lower the cost of production , as well as another mill , with production of pipes up to 47 meters per minute .
by the end of 2014 , the company will launch tubes that are used in housing and communal services .
the administration seeks to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the tyumen region in this production .
deputy director , department of investment policy of leonid ostroumov , referring to the leaders of the industry , advised to pay more attention to the modernization of the machine-building enterprises .
the aim and form of state support for the industry , which includes reimbursement of interest rates on credits on the purchase of new equipment and the cost of the lease .
this year the goal to allocate 150 million , two thirds of this amount has already been spent .
the last commission , which will review the subsidy contracts , accepts documents from enterprises to 15 november .
in addition , the budget shall be reimbursed the costs of participation of local producers in international markets .
next year &apos;s budget provides $ 150 million that can be used for compensation payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment .
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs , 3 million-for energy savings programs .
decreased to 72 millions rubles of the reimbursement of the ordered and paid for the equipment , which is in the south of tyumen region for oil and gas complex .
according to leonid ostroumova , this form of support will cease as the motif of its introduction was the compensation tax for mineral extraction , which oil companies pay to the regional budget .
at present , they do not become direct subsidy and consumable commitments in the region .
in view of this , the government considers a priority area direct support to industry , rather than financing them through the oil industry .
assistance budget will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace .
many business leaders have expressed concern about the situation in relations with oil companies .
a benefit for the equipment purchased is a competitive advantage to industry in the south of tyumen oblast , and its abolition will be difficult to compete on price with the average band russia where more than cheap labor .
in addition , the question was unclear with the continuity of the new owner of tnk-bp , rosneft , which is not yet places orders for tyumen .
agreement on implementation of the uvat expires in 2013 , and the application for its renewal .
at present , enterprises of the south region , specializing on equipment for the oil and gas sector , cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year .
the question remains open , whether taxes from oil produced in the uvat area of oil in the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner .

syria has destroyed their means of making chemical weapons , says monitoring group
syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas , said on thursday the international monitoring group , while fierce fighting raged in the north of the country , close to one of the objects , which are believed to toxic substances are stored .
also on thursday , the syrian group of activists declared that more than 120000 people were killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago .
a statement by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons was made one day before
november 1 deadline set by the organization based in the hague to damascus destroyed or did not have all the means of production of chemical weapons and tools to mix chemicals with poison gas and fill them with ammunition .
completion of the initial phase is essentially destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons of damascus by mid-2014 .
destruction of equipment means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
however , damascus has yet to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles .
the country is believed to have about 1000 metric tons of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin .
this statement was made during heavy fighting on thursday in the town of safira , in which , according to experts , is producing chemical weapons , as well as the location of its storage , according to britain-based syrian human rights protection centre .

according to the united nations from 25 july , 100000 died in the conflict since march 2011 .
since then , this number has not been updated .
the conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country .
few weeks government forces battled rebel safire in , many of them linked to al-qaeda groups .
the center said that on thursday there were casualties on both sides , but did not cite specific figures .
the fighting underscored the threat facing chemical weapons inspectors , spurred by the short time-frame of its mission to save syria from toxic arsenal , in the midst of the ongoing civil war .
in a statement issued by the opcw , which works in close cooperation with the united nations , said that her team was &quot; now satisfied that she checked and saw all of the alleged syria destroyed critical equipment and equipment for mixing / filling .
she added that &quot; no further inspection activities is currently not planned .
earlier this week , inspectors announced that they have completed the first round of testing , visiting 21 of 23 items claimed by damascus .
they have not been able to visit two locations for security reasons , said the inspectors .
on thursday , the opcw said that both places were , according to a statement from syria , &quot; abandoned and ... items of chemical weapons in them , were moved to other alleged locations that were tested .
could not immediately determine whether the object in the safire , one of the two places that the opcw inspectors were unable to visit .
syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , due to be approved next month by the executive committee of the opcw .
&quot; i salute the courage and bravery you have all demonstrated in the most challenging mission ever undertaken by the organization , &quot; said general manager ahmet Üzümcü amg in comments published by the opcw .

post : obama &apos;s campaign headquarters had an exception biden in favor of hillary clinton
according to the new york times , the closest advisers of president barack obama secretly considering replacing vice president joe biden , hillary clinton , candidate in the electoral list of 2012 year .
this discovery is the brightest sensation of all anticipated book from mark halperin and john hajlemanna of campaign 2012 year rates doubled : game change , 2012 &quot; .
the times has obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported thursday night that the president &apos;s close associates held &quot; extensive research with focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011 , to evaluate whether the exclusion biden help raise the dwindling hopes for obama &apos;s re-election .
according to political observer , the times , jonathan martin , the book provides a detailed description of attempts by high-ranking officials of the electoral staff and the white house , the former white house chief of staff , bill daley , to assess what effect the vote will have on the appointment of former secretary of state clinton as vice president .
possible replacement was secret , carefully guarded at the chicago campaign headquarters and in the oval office .
only six of the president &apos;s closest advisers — including daly , the former head of the obama campaign headquarters of jim messina and former senior white house advisers david axelrod and david pluffa — knew that replacement is discussed .
the book &quot; rates doubled asserts that daley was the initiator attempts to replace biden , despite their &quot; close personal relationship &quot; , but ultimately rejected that step , when data showed that adding clinton to the electoral list is not a &quot; will improve significantly the chances of obama . &quot;
in an interview with martin daly confirmed that the administration really had considered the possibility of replacing biden clinton .
&quot; i am actively advocated the consideration of a variety of things , and this was one of them , &quot; said the daily newspaper .
you must remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape , so we thought : &quot; oh my god , what do we do ? &quot;
although daley has described the study as &quot; the necessary checks , &quot; martin told cnn &apos;s anderson cooper , representative of the campaign headquarters a lot invested in the study of whether this move will bring dividends on voting .
« campaign headquarters not to spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups , if they do not take something seriously , &quot; said martin in the ak 360 .
it was unclear , however , whether obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacing .
martin told cnn that he asked daley , did his then boss of the shuffle .
while daley and said he did not think that the president was &quot; aware of &quot; possible replacement , former chief of staff , acknowledged that , &quot; possible &quot; , obama knew .
martin added that &quot; the rate doubled &quot; does not give a clear answer to the question whether the results reached political sensing to obama &apos;s desk .
cooper asked martin whether he seriously believes that obama did not know about the study exclude biden from the electoral list .
&quot; maybe , &quot; said martin .
head of the disciplinary committee of the rfu arthur grigoryants said that &quot; kuban &quot; was fined 500 rubles , the home of football correspondent &quot; se &quot; by philippe papenkov .
such sanctions against the krasnodar club applied for burning the flag of dagestan fans at the podium during a home match of round 14 vs anzhi .
at the meeting were representatives of both clubs , people from the russian premier league .
we have researched all available material .
the nepravometnoe behavior of the spectators &quot; kuban &quot; was fined 500 rubles .
legislative bans forced the russians to drink less beer
russian brewers bad mood .
according to their estimates , consumption of beer in the country next year will stay at the same level , and this is the best .
although originally expected growth of business .
after all , this year is shaping up for them failed : sales fell 7 percent .
all told , the head of one of the largest breweries in the country , the president of the council of the union of russian brewers isaac scheps at the iii annual conference of adam smith institute &quot; fmcg in russia &quot; , which has just concluded in moscow .
it discussed the state regulation of the market .
from 2008 to 2012 years the russian beer market has declined by 18 per cent , because in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in the production and sale of beer-drink with a little alcohol , told listeners scheps .
no country in the world has such a hard limit of the beer market , the unexpected introduction of more and more illogical bans , which are supposedly fighting alcohol abuse .
brewer complained that many legislative bans to reduce the level of alcohol abuse , had special effects , however , are all the new initiatives .
all the more painful by producers of beer injected this year slapped a ban on selling alcohol at kiosks .
&quot; we lost 35 million consumers , &quot; said isaac scheps .
the next year the brewers two predictions .
optimistic-the one mentioned by scheps : the sale of drink will remain at the same level .
pessimistic-drop even at 2-3 per cent .
to maintain their profits , businessmen are forced to move away from the varieties , designed for the mass market , in the &quot; premium &quot; class : beers will be less , but it will cost more .
meanwhile , the radical implications of declining sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight .
&quot; according to my observation , the level of the disease alcoholism remains at about the same level , said physician-narcologist abdullah .
however , increased the proportion of patients who use surrogates of spirits , as well as those who are &quot; hooked &quot; on spirit-based tonics like &quot; jaguar &quot; , whereas ten years ago dominated the &quot; pub &quot; alcoholism .
what will the construction of tcu in moscow
every year city authorities promised to arrange more transport hubs ( tpu ) .
until 2020 , to be introduced in build 255 tpu .
the project has , in fact , was our correspondent .
a couple of months ago &quot; smolenskaya &quot; metro arbatsko-pokrovskaya line began building the fence .
the inscription read , that is a transfer site transportation installation .
it was all very strange , as the &quot; smolensk &quot; no land transport stops and therefore you cannot change .
to reach the nearest trolley stop on the garden ring , one must overcome some 130 meters , including ground moving through karmanickij pereulok .
we now have the &quot; smolensk &quot; almost all finished .
faded flower stall , dismantled the stand for newspapers , and asphalt pavement was replaced before the entrance .
that &apos;s the whole hub .
freight interchange sites are planar and capital , explains in the press-service of the department of transportation .
capital of tcu .
a planar construction of car parks , suggest withdrawal of trade objects , preventing the movement of passengers , creating small structures and landscaping .
actually , not even tpu planar transport workers , and professional blagoustroiteli from the department of master of the city of moscow .
transport hub is not necessarily a complicated design , explains the director of the institute of transport economics and transport policy at the higher school of economics mikhail blinkin .
sometimes a roof over their heads and boards , automate break bells about arrival time .
here , for example , yasenevo metro have recently opened a completely full plane hub .
let without canopies , but with &quot; sniffing &quot; parking and signage indicating when the bus .
but in the race for the number of officials write in tpu whatever you don &apos;t really need .
in 2011 , the city had planned to build all in all 151 site , 59 of them with capital project .
now the plans are up to the year 2020 up to 255 tpu .
one hundred and fifty of them promise to pass this year .
although the city has a program of development of tpu , not designated any qualitative criteria , -said alexander morozov , co-chairman of the public association &quot; the city and transport &quot; .
report on the number of objects , but the quality of transplants in each of them often deteriorates .
criteria , the expert believes that there should be two : first-time reduction , secondly-convenience .
first of all the possibility to change the mode of transport , under the rain .
in moscow in the regeneration of tpu sometimes goes exactly the opposite .
a striking example of the underground &quot; vdnkh &quot; .
before suburban buses with the yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the all-russia exhibition centre .
now they stop was moved to the opposite side of the street-astronauts .
further , much further from the monorail , but closer to homes .
the gift that the residents did not like the bus terminal under windows and complained to all possible agencies .
with capital of tcu in moscow somehow does not immediately need .
the first of them began to build five years ago at metro &quot; planernaya &quot; .
the project was supposed to be a model .
and really is an example of how the hub , given to investors , turning into a hackneyed emporium .
no , there are platforms for buses , carport , to avoid going on the subway in the rain , and three floors of parking .
however , himkinskim no. 202 and no. trolley 203 in moscow have not fundamentally tpu .
as others moved away from metro .
but trade more space left .
only one clothing store , 32 and in general have almost everything from pet supplies to a car dealership .
well in fact , suddenly the bus passengers will need to buy a new car in the driveway ?
when are building major tpu , somehow always turns out shopping center .
recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of the car park decided to give away the market .
now on the third floor of the tpu &quot; planernaya &quot; marked on the floor of the parking spaces is brisk trade .
vegetables , spices , chinese jeans , nerusskaâ speech and the guards , viciously poglâdyvaûŝie to our photographer .
hub finally turned into a bazaar .
the thing that used to have a metro &quot; planernaya &quot; was , but it was demolished .
and in the prefecture of merchants donated and allowed to that site has parking .
anyway because of the high prices there are always empty .
the most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place. a new planar tpu .
this castling .
at metro &quot; kaluga &quot; distance approach from lobby metro bus was 50 metres , -says alexander morozov .
after the construction of the shopping center , supposedly tpu , the distance was increased to 170 meters .
to board the bus , you must go through the entire mall .
after 10 : 0 pm , when it is closed to avoid it .
however , construction on &quot; planernaya &quot; and &quot; kaluga &quot; will soon be flowers .
in mid-september , town-planning-land commission city council approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital tpu .
four of them will be 25-story , not counting two or three underground storeys .
the main monster will rise from underground &quot; tushino &quot; , there will be thousands of 418.7. meters square .
representatives of the directorate of the russian railways , railway stations are responsible for the construction of the subway , already have tpu told reporters : in the future-there will be shops , hotels and apartments .
the officials insist that the multilevel parking zai-mut between one third and one half of the square .
take for example the &quot; folk &quot; garages .
say , a garage for 258 cars , which recently built on international street , has an area of 8015 sq.ft. meters .
means for parking for thousands of cars from 2.6 &quot; petrovsko-her &quot; will need about 80 thousand &quot; squares &quot; .
it &apos;s less than a third of the huge things that you are going to build there .
let one or two floors will go on all sorts of platforms for buses .
remains at least 150 thousand square meters. feet of commercial real estate .
and this , for just a moment , almost two gum .
if the capital of tcu at stations and stations built by railway workers , the remaining area will master builders were .
they also promised that there will be a lot of &quot; functional purpose of objects , &quot; including hotels , offices and even gyms .
by the way , in the department of property of the city of moscow , recently told reporters that developed a draft decree , according to which investors can apply for a plot for tcu officials directly .
without any contests .
because , they say , that the transportation issues for the city is the priority .
tpu is ideal , for example , &quot; harvard &quot; in boston or &quot; spadajna &quot; in toronto , said alexander morozov .
there &apos;s trolleys and trams go underground to the subway and distance approach from the car to the tram is just 50 metres away , without going outside .
around no ugly trade .
but moscow officials throws in the extreme .
either nothing will build or too otgrohaem 25 floors with offices and apartments .
oil dropped in price to $ 96 a barrel .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , when worries about the education of large stockpiles eclipsed a message showing that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector of china is gaining momentum .
the benchmark grade of crude oil in the united states the december delivery fell to 14 cents , and its price was $ 96,24 per barrel by late morning european time in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange .
on thursday , the contract fell to 39 cents , which in total amounted to drop prices for october to 5.8 percent .

bombardier profit declines with the fall of deliveries and the number of orders for airplanes
bombardier inc . , a canadian manufacturer of planes and trains , reported thursday a net profit of 15 per cent under the influence of reduced the number of orders and delivery of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division .
located in montreal , the company bombardier also has not published any data on flight tests of its new cseries aircraft and provided no new information on whether implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of aircraft into commercial operation by next september .
after the first flight of the prototype aircraft took place about a month and a half ago , he was still only three times , raising questions about whether stage of testing on schedule .
the results fell short of expectations and led to the fall of shares by more than 8 percent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , an analyst with national bank financial , lowered on thursday its assessment from &quot; higher than market average &quot; to &quot; than market average because of the belief that the growth of shares is restricted in the next quarter or two .
&quot; although the decline in the supply of aircraft was in generally predictable , we are certainly disappointed by the profit figures of the transport department , &quot; said doerksen in the stock market .
we believe that bombardier will have new orders to the cseries as the flight test program .
however , if in the coming months will not be announced new orders , we assume that the market will become more sceptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the cseries aircraft family will win a place in the lower price segment of the market , where it is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first prototype of the aircraft was presented in march and flew for the first time in september after months of delay .
however , solid orders for the cseries has so far not too much is 177 , because potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify claims about fuel efficiency and potential profitability of the new liner .
there are a total of 403 of the order and agreement with 15 customers and operators .
chief executive officer pierre beaudoin was sure that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 solid orders to the moment when the first plane to be launched into commercial operation .
on thursday , the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward according to plan .
the test model of the aircraft does not remain on earth longer than expected , &quot; said beaudoin during a conference call , adding that the aircraft were planned downtime ground testing , and software updates .
all manufacturers plan to test in different ways .
we decided to conduct the first flight and make a break for updates , so we did .
this will happen during the flight test program .
the second of five test samples must take flight in the coming weeks and the rest would soon follow him , as reported by the company .
still , analysts are skeptical about the announcement that the first client will be able to proceed with the cseries aircraft operation through the 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier said that it estimates the launch date and will provide an update in the next few months .
&quot; the slow pace of flight tests-although , apparently , and matches the internal graphics bombardier-reinforces our view that commissioning would be moved to the first quarter of the year 2015 , &quot; said doerksen .
performance in the third quarter , 30 september , bombardier &apos;s net income fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , last year .
adjusted earnings per share remained the same-9 cents .
gross income declined slightly , from $ 4.1 billion to $ 4.2 .
analysts had expected profit of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $ 4,56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from the previous year to 57 .
the total number of orders has fallen from 83 to 26 aircraft .
aerospace division order backlog amounted to usd 32.9 billion at 30 september , not losing since december 31 .
&quot; in the aerospace field results correspond to our objectives , but a small number of orders and general market conditions have become an embarrassment factor , &quot; said beaudoin .
gross revenue of aviakosmičeskomu in fell to 13 per cent , to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest manufacturer of trains , said that the gross revenue in this sector increased by nearly 11 per cent , to $ 2.1 billion .
order backlog in the transport business unit amounted to $ 32,6 billion on sept . 30 , slightly higher than the 31 december .
income was negatively affected by transport problems with the execution of several large contracts .
management stated that in the fourth quarter will be a new development plan .
shares of bombardier , who also announced that google &apos;s chief financial officer patrick pichette will join the board of directors , fell 8.5 percent to p $ 4,83 on trades in the middle of the day on thursday .

two members of the ymca accused of sexual crimes before charges against jonathan lord , as the royal commission
two members of the ymca were accused nsw sexual crimes against children before bringing charges in 2011 against professional child-care facilities in karingbahe jonathan lord , told the royal commission on sexual abuse of children .
but in the introductory statement , the commission said that it &quot; has never had to deal with cases of child sexual abuse within their organizations .
chief executive philippe hèjra asked on one occasion , when an employee of the ymca was accused of crimes related to child pornography , and on another occasion , when the gym instructor in caringbah ymca hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under its supervision , in 1991 .
mr. hare said gail furness , a lawyer , providing assistance to the commission , that he was aware of the case but did not know about the second .
he acknowledged that the ymca in the introductory speech to the commission also allowed the inaccuracy , asserting that there were external checks of the ymca , have accepted that the ymca is in the forefront to ensure the safety of children . &quot;
submitted to the commission the evidence suggest that the ymca was notified that it had received a second from the end of the four possible ratings quality audit , performed by the education department and communities in august this year .
mr. hare , who joined the ymca when he was 21 years , admitted that he and subordinate leaders made a blunder by hiring the lord , and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the personnel of their obligations with respect to the allegations of violations of security policies .
earlier this year lord has been convicted of sex crimes against boys 12 within two years of its work at the ymca .
he was jailed for at least six years .
but mr. hare has rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics ymca prevented employees to report violations of the lord in the safety of children .
employees testified that they observed violations , including that the lord was alone with the children , personally wooed them , planted them at the knees , said he likes one of them and let them play to their mobile phone .
daniel brontë , which was under the leadership of lord and asked him to teach her children because she was concerned about his behavior , that was jackie barnat , manager , child care branch of the ymca in karingbahe , who was the head of the lord , &quot; the very frightening and often hard-to-reach &quot; .
the executive director said that he does not accept the explanation of the officers that he was embarrassed to report the situation to its parent leaders .
rather , he said , their friendship with lord has diverted them from the thought of having to report it .
mr. hare said he presented to the council the ymca of new south wales , its view that lesson for the organization of the &quot; incident with jonathan lord &quot; not &quot; providing information &quot; on the part of employees , and the board agreed with him .
mr hare stated that the decision to force employees to sign a confidentiality agreement soon after the accusations were made by the director of the ymca child care liam wheatley .
he said it was intended to prevent corruption of evidence but &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
ymca of new south wales was not safe for kids organization while working in it jonathan lord during the period 2009-2011 , told the commission on child abuse expert professor stephen griffith of the university of smolboun .
he said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , selection , coaching , training and monitoring .
the hearing adjourned until 20 december .
a screen adaptation of guillaume nicla novel denis diderot boasts exceptional setting and historical details , but it is also heavier than perceived , than should have been .
the film , which is set in france in 1760 &apos; s , tells a grim story of susanna , a young noblewoman , sent to the monastery of his family .
when she begins to rebel , she experiences an extreme cruelty at the hands of the international migrants day-mother and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others .
the film never descends to vulgarity or sensationalism-and that &apos;s the problem .
because of its great solemnity the narrative risks becoming a test like vlasânicy and for the audience .

ben grinmen : tenth anniversary of the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
it is safe to say that new york is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america almost a century ago : entertainer frank fay , who was master of ceremonies at the palace theatre on broadway , started telling jokes directly to the public in the conversational manner .
innovation fay eventually was picked up by other , more recently , the new york comedy festival .
created and sponsored by caroline hirsch , the founder of stand-up comedy club carolines , the festival celebrates this year its tenth anniversary , with over sixty shows in small clubs and theaters .
&quot; most of these started at headliners of the carolines , and then achieved more success , reaching the point where they are too famous to be in the club , &quot; said hirsch .
we have created this festival as a way to continue to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes performances of wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill mara , as well as the stand-up for heroes &quot; is an annual musical-comedy benefit concert for military veterans in madison square garden , where there will be , among others , bruce springsteen , jon stewart , roger waters , and bill cosby .
with the expansion of the festival has expanded and the world of comedy .
few comedians participating in the festival this year , have gained in popularity in non-traditional way , such as through a show on small television channels like comedy central , fx , and spike .
nick kroll got known for actor in a comedy series on little-known cable channel ( deliberate skabreznaâ &quot; league of the fxx on &quot; fantasy football ) , and now leads his own sketch show on comedy central .
jenny slate joined the cast of &quot; saturday night live &quot; and &quot; parks and recreation &quot; , but most of all she is known for a series of viral spots &quot; marseille-shell boots &quot; .
and kroll , and slate , like other young comedians with a distinctive style ( surreal pessimistic anthony džeselnik , crafty , focused on racial topics kamau bell ) , is the result of a decentralized world of american comedy .
one of the highlights of the festival will be an interview with david steinberg with larry david .
steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian , but later became a successful director in television and film , as well as the unofficial historian of comedy .
from 2005 to 2007 he was the host of the show on tv land called sit down comedy with david steinberg .
the meeting will be held in the hall of the town hall in midtown manhattan .
&quot; this city is certainly a central element of the work of larry , &quot; said steinberg .
he told me that he sometimes come here walking on any street between the two houses and thinks : &quot; if i stay completely out of money , maybe i &apos;ll live here . &quot;
