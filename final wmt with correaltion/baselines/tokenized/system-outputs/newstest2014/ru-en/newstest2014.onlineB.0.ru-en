anger over the verdict to the organizers of the terrorist attack in bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 victims of the bombing in bali in 2002 , reacted angrily to the verdict last of the conspirators , who appeared before the court and stated that umar patek to be shot .

it can be released for 15 years if he gets parole .
45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of ​ ​ kuta , in which 202 people were killed , including 88 australians , and wounded dozens more .
he was also found guilty on several other terrorism-related charges , including a wave of bombings of churches across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors demanded life sentences , though they might insist that the man nicknamed &quot; bomber &quot; for his reputation as a master for the production of explosive devices , should be sentenced to death .
this decision aggravated the painful memories of perth mother june cortina , who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters jane and jenny in the attack , effected patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago .
fighting back tears , she said patek was to be sentenced to death .
&quot; i really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys .
he must be brought before a firing squad - said ms. cortina aap .
- i have to live every day knowing that i will no longer grandchildren and i do not see my daughters . &quot;
club &quot; sari &quot; was destroyed when it was powered by a massive explosive device planted in a van parked outside , just after 11 pm oct. 12 , 2002 .
peter hughes was in the bar , &quot; paddy &quot; , where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier .
after the attack it for a month in a coma and &quot; died &quot; three times , being connected to a life support system .
mr. hughes said that patek should share the fate of the other three members of the terrorist cell &quot; jemaah islamiyah &quot; , responsible for the carnage - amrozi , imam samudra and muhlasa who were executed four years ago .
indeed , this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone .
to save his life , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
get 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded hundreds - it &apos;s not much .
patek is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in bali , appeared before the court .
he was hiding for nearly ten years , but eventually was arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where u.s. forces killed a former leader of &quot; al-qaeda &quot; osama bin laden less than four months later .
during the trial , an fbi agent showed that intelligence indicated : patek was in pakistan to meet with bin laden in an attempt to restore the connection between terrorist groups in south-east asia and &quot; al qaeda . &quot;
&quot; he did not give up , &quot; - said ms. cortina .
until recently , he was not sorry about how much grief he caused others .
the sentence was passed on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack , which will be celebrated later this year in bali and australia .
&quot; this year will be a lot of tears , &quot; - says ms. cortina .
patek can still appeal their sentence .

manufacturers jets feuding over the width of the seat at stake in big orders
between the leading aircraft manufacturers bitter dispute broke out over the width of the tourist class seats on long haul flights , setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the dubai air show this month .
the dispute revolves around the width of the seat provided on long-haul economy class passengers , whose interests are not always in the spotlight of the airlines , while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in establishing the effectiveness of the latest aircraft , the proposed airbus sas and boeing co .
airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of not less than 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in the salons of economy class , but its main u.s. rival boeing says it should solve the airline .
the debate is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of larger and larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul aircraft , and on november 17-21 event expected to potentially record orders .
the layout of the rear of the plane - especially the sitting down 9 or 10 people in a row - is central to the statements about the cost-effectiveness of new projects &quot; mini-jumbo jet . &quot;
boeing says its new 777x will accommodate 406 people , based on the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width , placed at 10 in a row .
airbus says that competing version of its a350 will carry in economy class seats on the 350 width of 18 inches , located at 9 in a row .
giants aircraft often trade blows on technical issues through advertising in the trade press .
now airbus is drawn directly to the public before the air show in dubai , where 777x , is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders .
she recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing financiers slide showing three people in the restaurant , pressed against each other , titled &quot; would you agree to that ? &quot;
« boeing offers long-haul flights on the seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft , &quot; - said the head of john leahy , airbus sales .
with the change of diet people gain weight , but the airplane seat is not fundamentally changed .
between the beginning of 1970 , when the widebody boeing 747 sets the standard for modern long-distance travel , and the turn of the century the average weight of american men aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent , according to u.s. department of health .
waistline of the average american male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches , according to statistics the u.s. health service .
airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept seats 1950s , when the average waistline of those who recently called &quot; reactive public &quot; was already .
airbus says it has ordered a study showing that the extra inch in width seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent .
boeing disputes the figures airbus size seat and says that producers should not interfere in the decisions about how to find a balance between the airlines fares and amenities .
according to her , studies show that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat .
&quot; all it really boils down to giving airlines the choice and opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed , &quot; - said the expert boeing &apos;s kent craver salons .
they do not want us to decide for them that will bring them profits .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers question is to increase the space on the sides , but for suppliers is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits .
during the dispute is worth the race for orders for the aircraft , valued at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of the u.s. and european exports .
as first reported in july , reuters , seating arrangement - this is what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets .
as airbus , boeing and claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engined models in comparison with the market leader in this segment , 365-seat boeing 777-300er .
boeing claimed characteristics are based in part on a comparison of 10-777x series include the original 9-seater layout series of constructive solutions 777 .
profit in the unit cost decreases as compared to 10-seater layout , currently in use .
&quot; the reason that boeing does this is to cram more seats and make your aircraft more competitive with our development , &quot; - said kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort airbus in europe .
on the other hand , analysts say lounges with full 10-seater series for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangement , which can go hand in hand with lower rates .
&quot; seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for commuters , but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the proposal airbus due to the threat from the 777-th model , &quot; - said the salon stylist mary kirby , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing do not supply the chair , but offer supplier directory from which airlines can select .
traveling the world sellers jets even carry with them a tape measure to check the competing plan .
praising comfort , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very compact layout salon for low cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus a350 offers a 10-seat rows , but says she still has not sold it .
until recently airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons offering wider of the aisle on some of its aircraft .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft , experts say , its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to &quot; take off &quot; , but may divert attention from the wave of selling model 777x .

total subsidies from the budget of the region receive 187 of 288 settlements .
in 2013 , 187 of the 288 settlements receive subsidies from the regional budget .
the share of subsidies in the budget revenues 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 % , and 83 - one hundred percent subsidy .
within the budgetary provision of the regional budget is sent about 25 billion rubles , &quot; - said olejnikov .
vice-governor said that only three towns - mytishch odintsovo and pushkin - budget revenues of over 1 billion rubles for 2013 .

security concerns in mozambique is growing due to the conflict influential people
under looks down on them statue samora machel , president and founder of mozambique , thousands of people gathered in the center of maputo , to chant slogans of peace in one of the few demonstrations here .
&quot; we want to return the world , we want stability , &quot; - said vanessa de sousa , executive director of the investment company .
fearing for the future of their country , she changed her business suit on a t-shirt decorated with the words &quot; we demand security &quot; in portuguese , and joined the crowd on thursday at the metropolitan independence square .
within two weeks , there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and renamo - it &apos;s one of the most violent clashes since the truce for more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once known rebel movement , which was supported by the white government of rhodesia first , and then the south african government of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country .
after the armistice in 1992 it became the opposition party .
analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again slide into full-scale conflict , but recent events have made the crowd of foreign investors and locals .
the stakes are high for the fast-growing economy , since the discovery of vast offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could bring more than $ 50 billion in investment over the next few years by companies such as rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko of the u.s. .
the ruling party frelimo , the leading political force in 1975 , and the party renamo accuse each other creates tension .
renamo party argues that the government has become the instigator of recent clashes by attacking its members in sofala province , the traditional stronghold of renamo , on october 17 .
attacks on former rebels then exacerbated when government troops attacked the base and tried to kill renamo afonso dhlakamu - leader of the group , told the financial times fernando mazang representative renamo .
the government blames renamo in initiating clashes , accusing the party in the attack on the soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to allay fears of instability .
guebuza said the afp , the french news agency on wednesday that mr. dhlakama felt a &quot; loser &quot; , who wanted to use &quot; all that was left of his forces to try to prove that it can impose its own solutions to the government . &quot;
how frelimo and renamo insist that they want to avoid war .
however , concerns rose after reports that mazang said the refusal of renamo peace agreement in 1992 .
he told financial times , that meant non-compliance with the agreement frelimo party .
&quot; our goal - to return to negotiations , but in all seriousness , &quot; - said mazang .
previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tensions that intensified clashes series this year .
&quot; these are two powerful men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , faced foreheads &quot; - said joseph hanlon , open university lecturer and expert on mozambique .
none of them is not a good negotiator , and none of them are not ready to make the necessary concessions .
renamo party that tries to achieve electoral reforms , has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted this as an attempt to pressure weakened the movement to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the government .
the proportion of votes for renamo reduced since 1992 , while the new party - the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) , which was founded by former renamo member , is expected to improve their performance in these elections .
mr. mazang said that mr. guebuza , who must resign next year , when his second term , wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he does not want to multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he did not want to leave the presidency , &quot; - said mazang .
it is unclear to the possibilities that renamo , but she has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and vehicles to the key motorway leading from north to south .
most of the clashes took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometers north of maputo , beira but includes - port to mining companies , including rio tinto and vale , used to export coal .
in june , rio has suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after the renamo threatened attack on the railway .
mazang was evasive when asked about that , repeat the renamo this threat .
renamo party wanted to &quot; warn the international community that the case in mozambique are not going well , &quot; - said mazang .
instability has increased dissatisfaction with the government , and many people are also concerned about corruption and the slow pace of development and recently frequent kidnappings , says fernando lima , head of an independent media company mediacoop .
&quot; people think that the responsibility for the country &apos;s future lies with the government and the president , who must find a solution to these problems , &quot; - he says .
omar sultuan , demonstrator , said that people just want stability .
&quot; nobody cares nor renamo or frelimo , they just want the resumption of peace , they want free access to roads , &quot; - he said .
terms of use of electronic devices on aircraft in australia yet remain in force
australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing , despite the measures taken in the united states to mitigate the rules relating to these devices .
u.s. federal aviation administration allowed u.s. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books , watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing , provided that they remain in &quot; flight mode &quot; .
passengers can already do it during the main part of the flight , but many annoying that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing .
australian carriers consider this decision by requesting from the u.s. airlines to spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements , but have indicated that they do not plan to in the near future to change their procedures .
the office of civil aviation safety authority also noted that they are considering this statement , but stressed that the restrictions on use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight is still operating in australia .
&quot; managing the safety of civil aviation currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes , &quot; - said it .
this issue is governed by rules that require carriers to enforce security at any time , and from the passengers - to follow safety rules , which they are told crew members .
company virgin , which had already discussed with the office of civil aviation safety increased use of on-board entertainment system with its wi-fi , was not against change , but stated that it will follow the instructions of the controller .
&quot; we would welcome consideration by the office of civil aviation safety issue to permit the use of electronic devices , because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that she ( airborne wireless entertainment system ) are on our aircraft , &quot; - said the spokesman .
qantas said it would adhere to the currently effective regulations .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices can not be used during takeoff and landing , and soon we are not going to change it , &quot; - she said .
resolution of the faa applies to u.s. airlines .
nevertheless , we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers , and we will certainly scrutinize faa decision and the reasons behind it .

statistics russian siloviki group &quot; fraternal circle &quot; to which washington has ranked singer grigory leps , does not appear .
as noted by &quot; interfax &quot; in russian law enforcement , after the media reported on the introduction of the u.s. treasury grigory leps in checklists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal syndicate &quot; fraternal circle &quot; were checked all databases , but such a grouping was found .
dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called &quot; russian mafia &quot; , which allegedly operates abroad , believe in the power structures .
&quot; even in the title - &apos; fraternal circle &apos; , there is a certain element of mystery , an allusion to a secret lodge .
&quot; all this is very similar to the pr campaign , &quot; - said the agency interlocutor .
the u.s. treasury department announced on oct. 31 on entering into their checklists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal syndicate &quot; fraternal circle &quot; arthur badalian gregory lepsveridze vadim lalin , sergei moskalenko , jacob rybalsky and igor shlykova .

scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog associated with her ​ ​ mood .
earlier studies have shown that happy dogs wag their tails to the right ( from the perspective of a dog ) , while anxious dogs wagging their tails predominantly in the left side .
but now scientists say that the other members of the canine may notice these subtle differences in tail wagging and respond to them .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the university of trent , said : &quot; it is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain in different ways involved in the formation of motivators that cause positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we tried to look at this and other species .
he added that , just as in humans , dogs right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa , and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs respond to versatile povilivaniya tails of other dogs , the researchers observed the animals , when they watched movies about other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior .
probably , soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes sent in one direction , and sometimes - in other
vallortigara professor said : &quot; we showed a video with dogs dogs - or naturalistic version or silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors , and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and the tail to send more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw that otherwise nothing expresses the dog moves the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the tail wagging the dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but when they noticed that the tail tended predominantly left ( again in terms of the tail wagging the dog ) , their heartbeat quickening and they looked alarmed .
vallortigara professor said he does not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these motions .
in fact , he believes that dogs have learned from experience what kind of movements they should worry about and what - no .
he says : &quot; if there is a number of meetings with other dogs and often wagging their tail to one side due to the more friendly behavior , and the right side gives less friendly behavior , the dog reacts to this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that these results may give owners , veterinarians , trainers and a deeper understanding of their animal emotions .
expert in dog behavior , john bradshaw , a visiting fellow at the university of bristol veterinary school , said that it was not the first study to check whether the value for dogs left and right sides .
last year , a group of scientists from the university of lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if looking at an aggressive dog , and right when looking at a pretty dog .
and in other scientific work of the university of victoria in canada , he wrote : &quot; dogs often approached the dog-robot , wagging her tail when directed to the left rather than the right , instead of getting uptight - the opposite behavior with respect to the italian investigation . &quot;
he said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not fully perceived the animals in the movies or robotic dogs as dogs .
might be useful study of how dogs respond to these dogs , he said .
&quot; while the various mammals there is ample evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes , many details have yet to clarify , and dogs are no exception , &quot; - he said .
however , given the ease with which may be registered in their behavior , probably , soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes sent in one direction , and sometimes - in another .
is the elite of europe to do business with england ?
business for britain campaign was launched in april with the obligation to collect business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs uk want to see in the relationship with the eu .
to this end , we booked the largest and most comprehensive survey of british business leaders , asking them to express their thoughts about the uk and the eu business .
company yougov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a broad cross section of business in the uk by size , sector and region .
survey findings will be a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for opportunities to export outside of europe , focusing on countries that are modernizing and grow , while eu countries are at a standstill .
they want the government gave priority to the new trade relations with countries such as china , india and brazil , rather than wasting time on a long and difficult process of reforming the eu institutions entangled .
when asked about their views on specific policy issues , from antitrust laws to control product , the majority of business leaders believed that controlling these core competencies must be returned to westminster .
general dissatisfaction with the present single market , and business representatives have stated that the costs of regulation from brussels now outweigh the advantages of being in a shopping district in europe - have agreed with this , even 40 percent of large enterprises , traditionally the most pro-european of all companies .
last and most tellingly - our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants britain pursued a policy of treaty change and relations with the eu based on trade and not on politics .
this result , which was observed among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups , shows that business insist on a &quot; significant change &quot; , which returns the powers back to the uk .
the stakes are high - reaching changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the uk provide 16 percent shift in voting for it to stay in the eu .
at the prime minister should be no doubt : this poll shows that british business support his plan renegotiation uk membership in the eu .
it also shows that a business expects revision lead to a significant shift in this balance of forces back towards the uk .
best conditions for british business possible and are becoming increasingly necessary to the extent that the eurozone as embarking on the path of closer economic and financial union .
priority should be given jobs and economic growth in the uk and , as the results of our survey , for business it means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of brussels .

in siberia , it is not necessary to be vegan : greenhouse tomato soup will not replace
why vegetarianism is not fit to live in siberia , figuring ria novosti .
people completely abandon animal products should not live in siberia .
here they do not move the winter without loss of health and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them , according to respondents before the day vegan novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors .
drink liters of oil
veganism , when they refuse not only from meat and fish , but also on the milk , honey , eggs , becoming fashionable lifestyle .
however , dietitians believe that in novosibirsk and other cities in siberia to adhere to such strict rules in the diet , at least , would be unprofitable for health .
complete rejection of animal products is harmful .
in animal protein contains essential amino acids , which are very difficult to compensate for the plant .
it is necessary to include in the diet even milk or eggs &quot; - sure nutritionist marina god .
she cites the example of fish containing essential fatty acid omega-3 .
the richest oil them - flax .
&quot; to consume it in quantities necessary for a person , you need to drink liters ! &quot; - says nutritionist .
doctors believe that the inhabitants of siberia special attention should be paid to the diet in winter .
in this season especially vegetarianism questioned .
in the context of the realities of our high demands for food .
to keep warm , you need higher calorie content .
&quot; if a person limits himself to animal products , respectively , of the caloric he nedobiraet &quot; - says the expert .
agree dietician olga pozniak .
she adds that imported fruits and vegetables - not an option .
man eat better mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born .
the genetic code is set for the best uptake and digestion of these products .
and in the winter people do not want to chew cucumber and hot soup or something else posytnee &quot; - explains his position doctor .
according to her , the fact that there are vegans truly useful variety of cereals , grains , legumes , local vegetables , apples , remaining in the winter , frozen berries .
but this , clearly , is not enough for a healthy diet .
according to a gastroenterologist claudia arifulin , siberians organisms in sufficient levels of vitamins only from mid-august to mid-september .
full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions , when the temperature can change over night at 30 degrees and there is snow in may , inexpedient .
body need energy for life , and this is primarily fat , &quot; - says the physician .
doctors say that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women .
children grow up , they need a building material , including in the form of amino acids .
and adhering to vegetarianism , we give them defective .
pregnant also need extra protein , vitamins and trace elements in the menu .
&quot; veganki their underserved &quot; - sure god .
arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever you like , &quot; play toys that wants to . &quot;
he has already formed body , skeleton , organs .
and the children still need to be fed to the full .
if parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids , choosing him what he will eat , it &apos;s just a violation of children &apos;s rights .
&quot; the lack of certain substances for brain development , vision , bones , tomorrow will not restore , &quot; - she says .
all the interviewed health professionals agree on the low quality of winter grown in greenhouses and imported fruits and vegetables .
what to bring us and grown in greenhouses , contains fewer micronutrients necessary for us than ( grown ) in the open field .
&quot; the quality of products is not &quot; - says god .
arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards .
sometimes the producers &apos; desire to gather more crop damage the quality .
&quot; apples turn brown at the cut cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy , and tasteless tomatoes nearomatnye &quot; - gives examples of a doctor , adding that they likely are crammed with an excessive amount of fertilizer .
and are not suppliers of vitamins and fiber .
disagree zavlaboratoriey siberian physico-technical institute of agrarian problems , candidate of agricultural sciences vera petruk .
she says that with the right approach and compliance with all standards and requirements in greenhouses is possible to grow high-grade vegetables .
if you are trying to kick out more per square meter , of course , and will be watered more often overfeed plants and fertilizers .
for example , when too much nitrogen fertilizer , tomatoes are growing rapidly , they are large , but watery and savory &quot; - she explains , adding that the issue of quality in the first place depends on the conscience of the manufacturer .
russia is the struggle for urban pollution cars
attempts to solve the traffic problems of large cities were observed in most cities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century .
as a rule , it was either on their reconstruction and expansion of highways , or about trying to reduce the demand for car trips , the number of vehicles and the time of their use .
widely known example of singapore , where we have introduced strict quotas increase the number of private cars , and right to acquire bought at auctions .
its price can be two to three times the price of the car .
european cities , including london , have introduced a fee for entering the city center .
in germany , for example in hamburg and stuttgart , introduced the so-called green zones , where vehicles are allowed to enter only with a certain ekoklassom also used high quality fuels ( including biofuels or electric vehicles ) .
environmental protection agency in beijing , for example , adopted in 2012 , &quot; five-year plan for clean air &quot; total cost of about 250 billion yuan ( $ 40 billion ) .
as told &quot; kommersant &quot; director control vehicle pollution municipal bureau of environmental protection beijing kunsheng lee , the main purpose of five - reduction of air pollutants leading to 20-35 % by 2017 , growth in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million ( now 5 , 2,000,000 ) , as well as an increase of not more than 5 % of fuel used in the calculation
according to the agency , now vehicles in beijing is responsible for 22.5 % of the total air pollution .
among the main measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport , as well as the imposition of additional taxes on car owners .
among other things , the city measures &quot; green five year plan &quot; include accelerated compared to the rest of the country transition to european standards of fuel , the introduction of local eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuel , the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the central part of the city , a ban on the use of outdated vehicles ( except order
among automotive innovation beijing ban also applies to all private vehicles on the movement within the fifth ring road ( total capital of china six ) one day a week ( the relevant information contained in the license plate of the vehicle ) , as well as the issuance of license plates for cars on lottery basis ( for example , in 2011 ,
according to the current state program &quot; environment for 2012-2020 &quot; , the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 ( in 2012 there were 138 ) .
according to the ministry of the environment , in 2011 , &quot; mobile sources &quot; accounted for 41 % of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities .
in moscow , for example , emissions from cars is ten times the industry , and in st. petersburg - nine times .
in russia , until just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulations cars on city streets .
director of the institute of transport economics and transport policy hse mikhail blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips - it obviously unpopular , they can be accepted by the society only if they are completely universal .
in the case of moscow there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet , where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory influence - official and personal cars and automobiles &quot; privileged &quot; users , the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand ( about 5 % of the total fleet
recently urbanists of ecom center in st. petersburg , prepared the study , which analyzed the balance between the urban areas of residential buildings , pavement area and the number of vehicles .
key research findings : the city center is provided with roads twice less than the required majority of motorists and residents in the center , do not use cars every day , leaving them for a long time in parking lots or in the streets .
as a result , proposed not to build parking and storage of vehicles , not to expand , and reduce roadway ( so that the streets became more friendly for pedestrians ) , and restrict the use of personal transport and accommodation within the boundaries of the buffer zone of the historic center ( common area about 3212 ha , covering a number of

bvelle and his team spend almost every weekend , taking hundreds of patients
in this west african country doctors not so much - just one 5000 people
vote here or via your mobile device
dr. georges bvelle - one of the 10 main characters cnn in 2013 .
you can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters , so he became a hero of the year cnn .
this person will receive $ 250,000 to continue his outstanding work .
for 21 years , george bvelle saw his father back to life again and fell unconscious , wandering the hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him .
dzhamef bvelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near yaounde , capital of cameroon .
at first he was just a broken arm , but emerged infection had spread to the brain and caused a hematoma , which reminded him of himself until his death .
&quot; in cameroon , there was no neurosurgeons , - said george bvelle .
if we had money , we would have brought it out of cameroon .
instead bvelle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment they can get .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy - bvelle said .
- you can leave the house at 5 am , come running to the hospital to be first , but you &apos;re not the first .
patients very much .
some may die because they have to wait .
the situation has not changed much since then , as the father bvelle died in 2002 .
according to the world health organization in cameroon is only one doctor per 5,000 people .
for comparison , the ratio in the united states - one doctor per 413 people .
and even if cameroonians could see a doctor , many of them it would not be affordable .
two out of five people in this country live in poverty , and nearly three-quarters of health spending in it are private .
&quot; their only problem is poverty - said bvelle .
- and because of poverty , they can not enjoy your life . &quot;
seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his countrymen , bvelle was determined to do something about it .
in the past , dr. georges bvelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free transactions .
he became a doctor and running a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of yaounde .
he also founded the non-profit organization ascovime , which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people crowd into vans , tied to the roofs of medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit the village in need of assistance .
they are not always lucky .
more than once they had to push the car through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they are met , as these heroes : the celebration with songs and dances and the best facilities , which can only offer local residents .
free medical care in these villages is indeed cause for celebration , and bvelle his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning the team begins to take hundreds of patients .
&quot; we take 500 people on each trip , &quot; - said bvelle .
they come from all around within 60 kilometers from the village , and they come on foot .
each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services .
many people receiving treatment for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and diseases , sexually transmitted diseases .
others may get crutches donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents required for schools that many poor families simply can not afford .
in the evening , the brigade conducts a simple operation under local anesthesia .
transactions are usually held in the school building , municipality , or in the house , after the procedure , patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person .
using a generator for lighting operating and sanitizing equipment bvelle and its volunteers work to early sunday morning .
this backbreaking pace , but teams usually purposefulness help maintain rural musicians .
&quot; they all night beating the drums , so we were up and continued to work &quot; , - said bvelle .
on sunday , members of the team are sent back to the city , tired but proud of their work .
this group , consisting of cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students , 700 free transactions conducted over the past year , and they know that their help can make a huge difference for those they help .
one man explained that he received free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again .
&quot; this will change the future for me and my family , &quot; - said the man .
in addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon bvelle also works nights at private medical clinics around yaounde .
it is this second job , he said , provides 60 % of the funding for its non-profit organization , the remaining funds shall be covered by private donations .
&quot; i do not even know when he sleeps , &quot; - said katie o &apos;malley , a medical student second year drexel university in philadelphia , a volunteer group bvelle .
he was always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization to be able to continue these campaigns .
for future doctors and nurses , such as o &apos;malley coming from the u.s. and europe to join bvelle in carrying out its tasks , it is an opportunity to practice , they would never get at home .
&quot; we were able to assist in operations , where we helped to remove blood stains or tools to keep the doctor bvelle &quot; - said o &apos;malley .
as a sophomore , you &apos;d never get such an opportunity in america .
student volunteers themselves usually pay for their own travel to cameroon , often arriving with donated medicines .
but on arrival in yaounde their food , transportation and training will cover bvelle .
&quot; he is a hero , no doubt , &quot; - said o &apos;malley .
he gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the people of cameroon indefinitely .
for bvelle almost constant workload is not an ordeal .
helping others live a happy life , to fulfill this promise to his father - that &apos;s what brings him great joy .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy when i do this work - said bvelle .
- and i think about my father .

for the &quot; russian mafia &quot; in the united states finally stuck a new name - &quot; fraternal circle &quot;
this week &apos;s black list &quot; russian mafia &quot; in america is filled with new names and four companies .
the u.s. treasury introduced a &quot; fraternal circle &quot; three representatives of russia , two uzbek citizens and israelis .
one of the russians was the famous singer grigory leps , which the u.s. suspected of carrying money to members of the group .
overall , the u.s. blacklisted 22 people involved in the &quot; brotherly circle &quot; , and six affiliated organizations .
nevertheless , many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization actually exists .
&quot; statement of &apos; bratsk circle &apos; is more like an attempt to unite the disparate criminal groups , &quot; - said earlier expert on organized crime and professor at new york university mark galeotti .
according to him , &quot; fraternal circle &quot; reflects the popular perception of &quot; russian mafia . &quot;
&quot; i never met anyone in the russian law enforcement agencies or elsewhere who would confirm the existence of a criminal organization &quot; - quoted mr. galeotti american research center corruption and organized crime .
with mr. galeotti agree and professor at george mason university liz shelley .
&quot; if they work together , it &apos;s more like a criminal network , but not the organization &quot; - leads her words centre for research on corruption and organized crime .
in the middle of last year , mark galeotti , suggested that &quot; fraternal circle &quot; brings together increasingly close russian kingpin aslan usoyan known as grandpa hassan .
crime boss was killed in january of this year .
thus , the activity of lasha shushanashvili kalashova and zechariah , added to the list in 2012 , was closely associated with santa hassan and another participant list temuri mirzoyev accounted santa hassan nephew .
nevertheless , mr. galeotti notes that some personality and have no relation to usoyan .
according to him , all of them combined more general financial and criminal interests , such as the supply of drugs from afghanistan .
meanwhile , the scandal surrounding inclusion in &quot; fraternal circle &quot; grigory leps - the favorite singer of russian president vladimir putin - attracted the attention of the kremlin .
naturally , we hope to receive from our american colleagues partners more detailed information , in connection with which the decision was made , why it is made ​ ​ in such lists , - said the spokesman , dmitry peskov , the head of state .
in any case he ( leps ) is a russian citizen .
as well as the interests of all citizens of the russian federation , its interests will be protected .

snowden can interrogate russia
former u.s. intelligence officer edward snowden , likely will not travel outside of russia to testify in cases of tapping of telephone conversations with german chancellor angela merkel .
according to &quot; interfax &quot; on friday , a source familiar with the situation , american can answer the questions of the attorney general of germany in writing or in person in russia .
check out edward snowden beyond russia is practically excluded .
&quot; in this case , he will lose refugee status may be granted to washington countries - u.s. allies &quot; - a spokesman said .
&quot; however , in principle , the attorney general &apos;s office of germany could send their representatives to the russian federation or to submit written questions snowden , &quot; - said the source , adding that the issue should be worked out at the interstate level .
earlier , the german bundestag deputy hans-christian strebel said that edward snowden ready to testify in the case of wiretapping u.s. intelligence talks german chancellor .
snowden ready to testify german law enforcement authorities either in moscow or in germany .
ex-cia officer hinted that he knows a lot .
despite the fact that the u.s. nsa has blocked all his movements , snowden ready to come to germany .
however , for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival , &quot; - said strebel channel euronews .
snowden &apos;s lawyer anatoly kucherena , commenting on the source of &quot; interfax &quot; , said his client may cooperate with german investigators , but when and how - will solve itself .
u.s. citizen edward snowden , who worked for the national security agency ( nsa ) and the u.s. cia , fled to hong kong in may 2013 , then released information about secret operations of u.s. intelligence by spying on the internet .
snowden flew through moscow transit , but could not leave the airport because his passport revoked , u.s. authorities charged him in absentia serious charges , and the beginning of august remained in the transit area of ​ ​ the airport &quot; sheremetyevo &quot; .
on august snowden received a document to grant him temporary asylum in russia for a year and on the same day , left the &quot; sheremetyevo &quot; .
yesterday an american lawyer anatoly kucherena said his client got a job in &quot; a major russian company . &quot;
about nsa spying for angela merkel last week told german media .
according to journalists , telephone calls chancellor americans began to listen to in 2002 .
tracking station was allegedly at the u.s. embassy in berlin .
german authorities after the publication of these data indicated that the surveillance of merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of germany .

some of them are not experienced riders , and people looking for excitement , adventure and access to world-class events .
we are pleased to offer this way , in partnership with land rover and msa , and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines rally in the uk and abroad , as well as prepare the participants for the rigors and realities of the rally-raid .

children need to learn the myths and legends as &quot; lifestyle model , &quot; says the author .
tales of the torah could show that &quot; brute force can not defeat a sophisticated ruse &quot; , and arthurian legends show how important it is to have a dream .
saying that many of the myths will be &quot; too wild , too scandalous , and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools , &quot; crossley-holland stands for &quot; careful selection &quot; of suitable age texts .
&quot; i think it &apos;s wonderful that in america , myths and folklore are already part of education , &quot; - he said .
i advocated the introduction of a training program for twenty years .
he added that &quot; excessive moralizing &quot; the authors and teachers &apos; discourages interest &quot; in children , and the basic idea of &quot; sublimated &quot; in fascinating history .
crossley-holland , who translated the &quot; beowulf &quot; with the anglo-saxon language , and also wrote &quot; collection of norwegian myths &quot; for the penguin and &quot; british folk tales , &quot; said : &quot; you , of course , may be the intention , but you &apos;d better keep them to yourself . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between adult author writing for adults , and adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope .
not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending , but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil .
and it should be sublimated ; disclosed through history , and not clearly articulated .
the old principle : show , not tell .
goldman sachs warned of the risks for the russian economy
goldman sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver of economic growth in the fragile russian - consumption .
this is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass redundancies .
our main concern now - not that growth has slowed , but rather the structure of this growth .
recently , it is due entirely to consumption , which is almost never lowers the speed , &quot; - said the chief economist at goldman sachs in russia clemens grafe , representing the investment bank last quarterly report on the russian economy .
now the nominal wage growth in russia - about 10 % .
with inflation of 6 % , it will provide future consumer demand around the current level , expect to goldman sachs .
but russian companies profitability falls , therefore , most likely , they will be engaged in optimizing staff costs .
today , we see a significant increase in the share of wages in gdp : if wages are rising by 10 % , the gdp - only 2 % - said mr. box .
company experienced a decline in profitability .
if it does not grow , it could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment .
not to raise salaries russian business can not commented barclays capital chief economist for russia and cis vladimir pantyushin .
unemployment vblizi historical minimumov , competition rabotnikov vыsokaya .
to entice employees by or keep current , employers have to raise wages .
consumption in russia and supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit .
according to mr. earl , because of the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country , this type of lending has not .
&quot; uses for the growth of consumer credit economy , we have not seen any money do not disagree on the economy , and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments &quot; , - said the economist .
but the problem lies elsewhere - in the goldman sachs expect growth delay on unsecured loans .
they take mostly poor people who have nothing to offer as collateral .
interest on such loans are high .
as a result , they often do not return , &quot; - said mr. box .
therefore , the second threat to economic growth in russia - a possible crisis of payments on unsecured loans .
hse director of the banking institute vasily solodkov already sees signs of impending banking crisis .
small credit institutions without access to cheap resources , which have state-owned banks were forced to raise funds from the public at high interest rates .
in response , state-owned banks on the warpath , and began to cut lending rates - continues economist .
small credit institutions may not grant loans under the same interest , otherwise they will have negative interest margin .
if state-owned banks will not abandon dumping russia threatens full banking crisis , says vasily solodkov .
deprivation of licenses of some banks in recent weeks economist believes a harbinger of mass collapse .
&quot; sami state banks with such a situation is not right : the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis &quot; - warns the head of the institute .
but consumption growth will slow and without payments crisis , it is believed in the investment bank - due to the failure of the indexation of salaries of civil servants and military embedded within the current version of the draft budget .
partially shot consumption is mitigated by freezing tariffs of natural monopolies ( and , consequently , lower inflation ) .
but only partially : if the investment will not grow ( and prerequisites for this yet - see reference ) , consumption growth is still slow , sure goldman sachs .
vladimir pantyushin of barclays capital sees no prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios .
&quot; the main risk - it &apos;s still a drop in oil prices , &quot; - he says .
according to him , russia &apos;s economy will start to decline in oil prices below $ 90 . / bbl .
at goldman sachs also noted that the central bank has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy .
there is a paradox : inflation fell , and banks have to raise rates .
this may mean that they did not believe the central bank announced the transition to inflation targeting &quot; - said clemens grafe .
the interest rate policy of the central bank at market rates does not affect only affects the interbank lending rates .
&quot; for the cb is the collapse of all hope &quot; - praised clemens grafe .
money received in auctions cb banks use for not lending to the economy , and to manage their liquidity
once reduced rate , immediately changing exchange rate , which means that means trying to get away in speculation against the ruble .
&quot; sooner or later , the central bank will understand that this strategy does not work &quot; , - said mr. earl and recalled that keep the ruble &quot; free floating &quot; state plans by the end of 2015 .
but will either have to do it sooner or raise the key rate securities ( 5.5 % ) , he said .
according to his estimates , the ruble is now artificially inflated by 10 % .
ruble is only one way - to weaken , - the expert concludes .
but if the central bank be sown in financiers any doubt that the elimination of the exchange rate band - it &apos;s not part of a policy to weaken the ruble , it can bring down much stronger ruble .
snowden agreed to testify about tapping merkel
bundestag deputy hans-christian strebel moscow met with edward snowden .
during the meeting discussed whether snowden to be questioned as a witness in the case of attorney general of germany about possible phone tapping german chancellor spetssltsuzhbami usa .
snowden expressed readiness to provide the necessary evidence .
meeting could take place either in moscow or in germany .
he made ​ ​ it clear - said hans-christian strebel , - he knows a lot .
and despite the fact that the national security agency , led by keith alexander has blocked all his movements , snowden ready to come to germany .
but first , we need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival . .
meanwhile , u.s. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding spyware usa .
senate intelligence committee yesterday approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of u.s. intelligence agencies e .
faa : &quot; air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes ( but do not call from a mobile phone ) &quot;
airline passengers to use their electronic devices during the flight to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music , but do not talk on cell phones - according to a long-awaited new guidelines released thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect that changes will occur immediately .
how quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline , said faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
airlines will have to show the faa as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for flight crew members and rules laying devices to comply with the new guidelines .
faa stated that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .
delta and jetblue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the plan we could endorse the increased use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; - said the faa .
currently , passengers are required to turn their smartphones , tablets and other devices , as soon as the plane door closes .
they do not have to restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain did not give &quot; good &quot; .
passengers are required to turn off their device again when the plane is reduced to landing , and not include them until the plane is on the ground .
in accordance with the new guidelines , the airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off , landing and taxiing , the faa said .
most of the new aircraft and other aircraft , modified so that passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria .
laura gleyding , president of the association of professional flight attendant , welcomed these changes .
&quot; after the new policy will be implemented successfully ( and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this ) , it will be a win-win , &quot; - said gleyding .
we frankly feel tired &quot; duty to school &quot; when it comes to this issue .
but the connection to the internet for surfing , exchange e-mails , text messages or downloading data will still be smoking at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet , the agency reported .
passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices in airplane mode .
so , still no &quot; words with friends &quot; - an intelligent online games , in which the actor alec baldwin played on her smartphone in 2011 , when there was a sensational case : the actor was removed from an american airlines airplane for refusing to turn off the device at the time when the plane was at the gate .
a heavier devices such as laptops , still need to be laid in the luggage compartment , as they may injure someone if they fly around the cabin .
calls from a mobile phone in flight will also still banned .
regulatory authority for phone calls belong federal communications commission , not the faa .
faa may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
last month , mark rosenker of the national transportation safety board , a national expert on transportation safety cbs news , said that cell phones are still considered risky .
&quot; cell phones - it really is a problem , not only because they can potentially cause interference to navigation devices , but we know thanks to the fcc that they can interfere with cell towers , when the plane is in the air &quot; - said rosenker .
industry advisory committee created the faa to study the issue , recommended last month that the government has allowed wider use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years , increasing pressure on the faa to weaken the restrictions on their use .
reviews taki how senator democrat enabled shtata missuri klэr makkaskil , utverzhdaюt , chto äë threatened net veskih reasons svяzannыh bezopasnostью village .
compliance with the restrictions is also becoming more difficult to achieve , since the use of devices become ubiquitous .
some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their devices .
faa beginning to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment , when passengers began to carry fm-radio - high-tech gadgets that time .
new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft , but they also developed and approved by the faa , as resistant to electronic interference .
airlines offer passengers the use of wi-fi at the cruising altitude for several years .
aircraft modified for wi-fi-systems are also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices emit radio signals usually much lower power than previous generation devices .
devices for reading electronic books , for example , emit only minimal signals when flipping pages .
but the signals become more powerful when the device is charged or send data .
among those who sought to mitigate the restrictions on use of electronic devices by passengers , was the company amazon.com .
in 2011 , representatives of a loaded airliner their devices for reading electronic books kindle and flew it to check for problems , but have not found them .
members of the advisory committee , the faa expressed mixed feelings about that , is there any risk of the use of the devices .
douglas kidd of the national association of passengers stated that he considers interference from real devices , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only isolated reports of pilots , confirming that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of these posts are very old .
nevertheless , the committee recommended that the faa allowed pilots to require passengers to turn off the device during instrument landings in low visibility conditions .
a group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes , calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that passenger comfort is not inconsistent with the safety and security &quot; - said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
vilnius moscow suspects in an attempt to defame the lithuanian president
russia intends to implement information provocations against senior officials of lithuania and the eastern partnership countries - such statement agency bns made ​ ​ in the department of state security of the republic ( dgb ) .
information published on this portal delfi .
according to the announcement , moscow intends to &quot; specify &quot; lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the russian state archive , which relate to the facts of the biography of the lithuanian leader .
according to intelligence agencies , preparation of information attack leads department analysis of public management processes of russian presidential administration for interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries .
structure headed by eugene umerenkov , not once visited lithuania and took part in the congress of people &apos;s party of lithuania .
also a party to the alleged transaction is an employee of the department of smirnov .
according to the secret service , smirnov undercover scientific work until the end of 2012 came regularly in lithuania and in contact with local politicians , political scientists and media representatives .
smirnov now banned from entering the country .
lithuanian president grybauskaite eve stated that he knows about her upcoming informatake .
in her opinion , the main reason is the successful chairmanship of the council of lithuania in the european union and &quot; the pursuit of the country toward energy independence &quot;
lithuanian leader previously has repeatedly criticized the actions of the russian authorities .
so she claimed that the kremlin to lithuania are &quot; insufficiently respectful . &quot;
furthermore , grybauskaite accused the russian leader vladimir putin nomination to lithuania &quot; alone requirements . &quot;
recall that in september cps suspended imports lithuanian &quot; molochki &quot; in russia .
reported that the quality of the product does not meet sanitary-epidemiological norms .
then the leader of lithuania stated that if russia does not remove the ban , the government should prepare an appeal to the wto .
new anti-smoking vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
scientists have developed anti-nicotine vaccine , which could deprive the process of cigarette smoking pleasure .
one dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .
further tests prior to testing in humans , which can take several years , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college in new york said that the first results are encouraging .
&quot; we hope that this strategy is the use of the vaccine may finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit , having tried all the methods available on the market today , but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern &quot; - said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the production of anti-smoking antibodies .
virus selectively infects liver cells , which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies .
antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the blood , neutralizing them before they reach the brain while preventing nicotine smoker strike .
in tests , the vaccinated mice , which subsequently gave nicotine , continued their normal activities .
and mice that were not given the vaccine , &quot; relaxed &quot; , and it is an indication that nicotine reached their brains - say researchers .
Эти эксперименты описаны в журнале science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .
to maintain a high level of antibodies , injections should have been done so often that they were expensive and impractical .
but the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories .
professor crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe , it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette , preventing nicotine addiction .
but more likely it will be used by smokers to quit smoking .
&quot; they will know that if they start smoking again , they do not get pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine , and it can help them get rid of this habit , &quot; - he said .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but cautioned that more research is needed .

frontier airlines will charge you for ručnuû i bet
frontier airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for what they are carrying hand luggage on board their flight .
frontier airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 per cabin and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although their announcement on wednesday was that passengers can keep the whole jar .
the new fee applies to carry-on bags in the overhead storage compartments so small bags placed under the seat , will remain free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 if traveling will pay only once at the gate .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos;malley said that the fee of $ 100 to take care of passengers should make payment in advance .
&quot; we do not want to charge for it , &quot; - she said .
airlines started charging for the first and second bag , rent luggage in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid these fees , stuffed as much as they can , in hand luggage placed in overhead storage compartments , which is why in these compartments is often not enough space .
charges - one of the ways to get passengers to carry less on board .
o &apos;malley said that this new collection is not really for the sake of earning money .
the fact that the most loyal customers of frontier declare that find a place in the overhead storage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult .
passengers who buy tickets on the airline will not have to pay .
this means that one of the passengers in the queue at the exit for the flight frontier may be able to carry the bag for free , while the next passenger in the queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag .
o &apos;malley said that the change in procedures on the website and check-in counters frontier is intended to ensure that passengers are aware of the collection before they get to the gate .
new frontier collection for hand luggage will not start until the summer charged , although no date has been set .
passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges , but airlines love them .
they argue that the baggage handling costs money , and passengers who need this service should pay for it .
many on wall street believe adding baggage fees a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the costs of the flights after several years of losses .
but most of them do not touch fees for carry-on luggage .
spirit airlines inc. introduced first collection for hand luggage three years ago , and another discounter allegiant air later followed suit .
the only other airline with such a collection is hungarian wizz air , said airline consultant jay sorensen , who closely monitors the additional fees .
according to his assessment in a report dated december 2011 , the fee for carry-on luggage brings spirit $ 50 million per year .
sorensen , a former executive at midwest airlines , recently flew flight spirit , and he was wondering what he finds at the gate , where passengers will face an unusual collection of spirit in your hand luggage .
&quot; the process was the smoothest landing of those that i have seen in my career in the airlines , &quot; - he said .
i expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the appearance of a fight at the gate .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and the landing was fast . &quot;
frontier also follows the spirit against fee of $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice can keep the whole jar and topping up the coffee will be provided free of charge .
it will continue to distribute free water .
us airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 , but withdrew from the seven months after the passengers began to complain and no other major airline has not followed suit .
frontier initiative on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers buy tickets directly from the airlines - it is a last resort to attract customers to your website .
airlines pay online ticket sellers such as orbitz , from $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
this gave impetus to all airlines encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them and not to go to the online travel agency .
however , frontier has gone farthest in this area .
in september , she started to give half the bonus frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency .
on wednesday it had cut the number of miles a premium of up to 25 percent of the miles traveled .
so , a trip of 1,000 miles with frontier , purchased from an online travel agency , would yield 250 miles .
in addition , passengers can choose their place in advance only if they buy tickets directly from frontier .
at frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of denver , but her business is reduced and becomes unprofitable .
revenues declined by 9 percent , and flight capabilities decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released wednesday by the parent company republic airways holdings inc .

putin was impunity for his friend assad
and now - the news from overseas , namely - from syria , where , as we know today , israel struck the russian-made missiles , which reportedly meant &quot; hezbollah &quot; .
today syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy their november 1 chemical weapons .
this was done within the framework of an agreement reached with the mediation of russia , and not to allow the u.s. military operation to which they have approached this summer .
more details about the weapons and that all this mean for the syrian president , tell our chief international correspondent richard engel .
washington said that the assad regime will be punished for it .
more than 1,400 civilians , including hundreds of children , were killed in august of poison gas .
and it &apos;s punishment .
but not in the form of american bombing , but in the form of the transaction , which gave each assad - vladimir putin .
syria abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year .
and today - an important milestone .
a team of international experts reported that syria withdrew from the alleged failure factories producing chemical weapons .
longer-term and arduous task - is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it .
as we understand it , is about a thousand tons .
previously , washington said assad days are numbered .
i believe assad must go .
the question is not whether it will happen , and when it happens .
he is no longer legitimate and must leave .
but assad remains .

parents of intersex children can choose &quot; indeterminate sex &quot;
germany became the first european country to recognize the third gender in children born with external genitalia intermediate type .
newborns will no longer necessarily ascribe a male or female .
the new law does not require parents to call a half of these children , allowing parents to specify sex as &quot; indeterminate &quot; or &quot; unspecified &quot; in their birth certificates .
purpose of the law was to take pressure off parents who can take hasty decisions on the operation of assigning gender to infants and to fight against discrimination of intersex people .
one intersexual people , according to bbc , said many years later : &quot; i am not a man and not a woman . &quot;
i will remain established doctors quilt with bruises and scars .
approximately one out of two thousand children born each year , is neither boy nor girl .
they intersexuality , one of about 60 medical conditions that fall under the diagnosis of &quot; violation of sexual development &quot; - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testes ) or unusually developed , vulva .
wallis simpson was probably intersexual .
gender identity is still poorly understood , but most experts in the u.s. say that if sex can not be determined , it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of children before surgery , if it happens at all .
new york psychiatrist , dr. jack drescher , who specializes in gender identity issues , said that the new german law &quot; sounds like a good idea . &quot;
intersex children create an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have a life-threatening disorders that require surgery , but most children do not have them , &quot; - he said .
you can assign the floor without surgery and then see how personality develops .
the science of how a child develops any gender identity , not too accurate .
nobody can answer questions about why this is happening .
it &apos;s like a mystery as to why people are homosexual .
report sent to the european commission in 2011 , describes intersex people as distinguished from transsexual or transgender because their condition does not refer to gender , but to their biological structure that does not correspond exclusively male or female , as is typical for both simultaneously or not typical for any
these characteristics may occur in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , distribution of hair , breast and body ; primary sexual characteristics , such as the reproductive organs and genitals , or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment , as well as the level of harassment , violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp .
australia and nepal have allowed adults to put male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; in its official documents .
in june , 52-year-old australian resident norrie may-welby was the first person in the world , recognized as &quot; asexual &quot; , defended in court the right to maintain an &quot; indeterminate &quot; sex status for life .
according to the ministry of the interior , german passports to be used in the designation of the third addition to the m and f - x , that is intersexual .
in neighboring france gender issues still cause controversy , according to the news release on the channel france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of lawmakers from france , pronounced this catholic country , signed a petition for exemption &quot; gender theory &quot; from school textbooks .
american website catholic online also disagreed with german law , writing that &quot; in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state , where the floor is a matter of choice , and sexual activity - no , we turn two pillars of civilization . &quot;
one mother of a newborn baby from maryland also reported the website baby zone , that she would prefer to set the floor for children at birth .
&quot; raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , &quot; - she said the website for parents .
children need stability and confidence .
historically , children born with male and female sex organs , called hermaphrodites - on behalf of the beautiful greek god who possessed the characteristics of both sexes .
and just ten years ago the medical community sees gender as a sheet , which can all be erased , and then again to draw .
but now many disputed ethical grounds for surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice , not knowing how the child will be assigned to the perceived gender when he grows up .
&quot; in the middle of the xx century it was called &quot; urgent psychiatric case &quot; , &quot; - said drescher .
when these children were born , you do not call a psychiatrist - you call the surgeon .
the dominant theory of how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type was proposed by dr. john money of johns hopkins university , who believed that gender can be easily altered .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that environmental cues , including social - how parents raise their child - interact with genes and hormones child , determining whether a person will consider yourself a man or woman .
but in one case in 1966 , known as &quot; john / joan &quot; , his theories have come under question .
he advised the boy &apos;s parents , whose penis was damaged during circumcision negligent , completely neutered child , also removing his testicles , and raise him as a girl .
&quot; mani presented a case as a successful example of the transition , but it was not so &quot; - said drescher .
when he was about 15 years old , he again became a boy and a married woman .
but at age 38 , he committed suicide .
drescher said that now some doctors still &quot; apply this model . &quot;
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , people who survive these sex-change operations , declared themselves &quot; dissatisfied with the result . &quot;
such was the case of jim bruce , 36-year-old writer from montana , who was born with male chromosomes xy , but the genitals of an intermediate type .
the doctors could not determine exactly whether he has had a large clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he would never be able to live &quot; normal life &quot; men .
therefore , shortly after his birth in 1976 , the external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed bruce , and he was raised as a girl .
he was given female hormones at age 12 .
&quot; i knew i was not a girl , &quot; - he told abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was very difficult to ask questions .
at age 18 , he was granted a vaginoplasty .
but being depressed and realizing that something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
what he learned was terrible .
i was sterilized at birth , and no one ever told me about it .
bruce was born with impaired sexual development which did not give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of the genitals .
after learning the truth , he again became a man , receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts .
operation made ​ ​ him sterile .
today he advocates for others in an organization called the interface project , trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality .
but anne temar-mattis , executive director of the california bar association advocates for informed choice , concerned that german law &quot; to encourage labeling and stigma . &quot;
&quot; many activists are concerned that german law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child &quot; unspecified sex &quot; , &quot; - she said .
we are afraid that it will facilitate the intervention .
we believe that it is better to assign a male or a female , and then wait .
but we have not seen how this law will manifest itself , so all we can do - is to speculate .
temar-mattis said her organization supported the australian law because &quot; it allows adults to make a choice in favor of a third sex . &quot;
&quot; grown men should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex &quot; , - she says .
german law assumes its assignment at birth .
this battle , in which young children should not enter at this stage .
when they grow up , they will be able to make decisions about your own body .
but dr. arlene baratz , mammolog radiologist from pittsburgh , who has a daughter with impaired sexual development which helps hundreds of other people in the support group , said that the german law &quot; support &quot; of both parents and children .
baratz daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but she is a violation of sexual development called &quot; syndrome complete androgen insensitivity . &quot;
since its androgen receptors are not working properly , kathy developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and ovaries .
now , at 29 years old , married to cathy and extends residency in child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
despite the fact that she is infertile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy .
&quot; the law gives parents time to not make hasty decisions themselves , &quot; - said baratz .
it gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation , as well as the time interval before they write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; .
in this case , you are right - to raise a child , like a child .
you have a wonderful child , and you feel joy .
we need not hurry to do surgery , which is irreversible .
&quot; it allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents , because they do not feel like doing the right thing , &quot; - she said .
eventually the child decide what floor with him or her more comfortable - and it &apos;s wonderful .
it gives children the opportunity to decide on their own .

the court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of &quot; stop-and-search &quot; in the new york police department
on thursday , the court of appeal suspended the federal district court order requiring changes in the &quot; stop-and-search &quot; new york police department , and the judge dismissed the case .
court of appeals for the second circuit united states stated that the decisions of judge shira scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal lodged by the city .
in august , a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it executes the program on street detention and interrogation .
city appealed her decision and decisions on corrective measures , including the requirement to appoint a supervisor to help the police station to change working practices and associated training program .
on thursday , the court of appeals heard oral arguments on a motion to suspend the case .
the court of appeal stated the need for disqualification of a judge because it violated the code of conduct for united states judges and has not considered the need to avoid bias demonstrations , partly due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court .
the judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly referring to blacks and latinos under the &quot; stop-and-search . &quot;
she appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes , which include policy reforms , training and supervision , and also decided to launch a pilot program to test video cameras fixed on the body in those police stations , where the majority of detentions .
in august , new york came to the decision to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people to whom the case was terminated after a police check .
the debate on the appeal of the city should be held after march 14 , 2014 .
the tactic of &quot; stop and search &quot; criticized a variety of civil rights lawyers .
&quot; stop-search &quot; has been practiced for decades in one form or another , but the number of documented stops sharply increased during the administration of an independent mayor michael bloomberg , reaching in 2011 the absolute record of 684 330 people , most of them blacks and hispanics .
in 2004 , four people , all - representatives of national minorities , sued a class action lawsuit .
supporters of the changes in the &quot; stop-and-search &quot; in the new york police department said that these changes will put an end to unfair practices will form a more reliable and efficient police service and may affect how other police departments implement this practice .
opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police and not the crime rate would lead to an unnecessary waste of money and will not solve the global problem more difficult conditions due to the reduction in the number of police officers on several thousand over the last decade .
the judge noted that it does not stop the practice of &quot; stop-and-search &quot; , which corresponds to the constitution , however , changes the way in which the new york police stop people .
azarov promised ukrainians a collapse in prices for goods after the signing of association with the european union
prime minister mykola azarov is convinced that prices will fall significantly in the country after country will sign an association agreement with the european union .
he said this during a dialogue with readers of your page on &quot; facebook . &quot;
i can definitely say that prices are determined by many factors , among which are , inter alia , and customs duties .
so , after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions of the free trade area , the level of customs duties on imports from the eu will be significantly reduced .
and it will mean that prices should decrease .
&quot; so much for the goods that come from the eu , &quot; - wrote azarov .
as for other products , the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct , it is indirect .
but , nevertheless , there is also not to be price increases .
therefore , messages on billboards , which recently appeared in a lot of our country , that the association with the eu - is the rise in prices , it is not so , or to be more precise to say - not so &quot; - summed azarov .
rescue package of $ 325 million for the health of tasmania
the federal government insists that the rescue package of $ 325 million for the weakened health system will be complemented by tasmania stringent conditions which guarantee that the state government will not spend money for nothing .
federal health minister tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth takes &quot; urgent measures &quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of this island state , higher levels of chronic disease and the limitations of the system .
decision on funding for four years was made after consultation with the government of independent mp andrew wilkie tasmania .
&quot; the government has offered a package of emergency rescue measures , which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state , &quot; - said today ms plibersek .
package of $ 325 million includes $ 31 million blitz campaign to elective surgery .
another 2,600 operations , including orthopedic and cataract surgery , will help bridge the gap .
there is also money for clinics that accept patients without appointment in hobart and launceston , to improve the quality of care after a hospital , training of health professionals , mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments will be made ​ ​ by the best doctors realization of ideas about how best to help the health care system of tasmania , &quot; - said ms plibersek .
the minister insisted that the tasmanian government will operate in strict accountability and responsibility .
staff will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to obtain funds of the commonwealth , and to report monthly on how much he spends these additional funds .
will set up a commission of three members , to ensure that staff can provide services as efficiently and effectively .
mr wilkie said today that $ 325 million will not solve anything , &quot; unless they are followed by genuine reform , which will put the tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis . &quot;
nevertheless , he praised the government for its response to the request for emergency assistance , which he first addressed to the prime minister in early may .
&quot; i hope that the package of federal aid will contribute significantly to the conclusion of the health system in this state of the critical state , &quot; - said mr. wilkie .
according to the state government , these additional sampling procedures largely offset recent reductions .
but the federal opposition representative for health peter dutton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; solution similar bandaids . &quot;
&quot; the reason we are here is that the state labor government threw $ 430 million from the health care system , &quot; - he said broadcaster abc tv .
when the state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars , and the commonwealth is investing 300 million , we can not pretend that this is good news .
mr. dutton asked ms. plibersek ensure that none of the dollar rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy .
crick desperate voter obamы
i voted for president obama twice , sharing the hope for the possibility of changes
he says that obama allowed republicans obstructionism negate commendable efforts .
obstructionism does not excuse the problems with the web site obama reformed health care system , attack drones
a memoir of the obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could be
nathaniel p. morris - a second year student at harvard medical school .
i read the book terribly sad these days .
i thought that this book will inspire me in times of discouragement in the second year of medical school and revive in me a sense of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; and that a memoir of the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
evening when i finish writing reports on my patients and go to bed , this book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people , and performances could be dazzled .
the electoral victory was impressive , and the leading news programs did pause to reflect on this historic moment .
my classmates wept for joy , and my parents took care of all the newspapers that they could find .
in the white house had to come a young team of strategists , and people were ready for change .
during obama took office in 2008 , his support level was 82 % .
then i close the book .
back in the present , is a rude awakening , as pulling out of a dream .
hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of the missed opportunities .
in the years since , as i lowered my first ballot , the changes actually occurred .
it was then that i even could not imagine .
i give obama credit for his large and varied achievements , from the enactment of affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from iraq , canceling rules of &quot; do not ask , do not tell &quot; , the assassination of osama bin laden .
moreover , i believe that the party &apos;s obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move our country forward immigration reform , a choice of public health and the closure of the base in guantanamo bay , among others .
but after countless times when i found myself on the side of the obama administration , protecting her in front of colleagues and peers , i ran out of explanations that i can provide .
i reached the point of political desperation .
republican obstructionism can not explain the permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drone attacks on innocent children in other countries .
he can not explain the data collection on the privacy of americans national security agency or harassment of whistleblowers disclosing government misconduct .
he can not explain the killing of u.s. citizen anwar al-awlaki without a trial or failure limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaign .
he can not justify the conclusions of the report , which says that the white house exerted efforts to silence the media , are &quot; the most aggressive ... since the days of the nixon administration . &quot;
and lately he can not justify what you can not develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on access to care .
i do not know that i have to be expected .
should i was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership can contradict political campaigns that precede it ?
clearly , the work of elective office is not predictable action program , as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and random events such as the massacre in newtown .
nevertheless , all these examples i have outlined above it is clear that they were largely the administration &apos;s own choice .
and this is what bothers me the most .
again , i voted for obama in 2012 , but not because i was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy .
mitt romney was an obscure and rough alternative , it seemed that he was not able to decide on their own policies or views .
i figured that in his second term obama , freed from the pressure of future elections meet the expectations that we have heard for such a long time .
however , when this week obama &apos;s rating has fallen below 45 % , back in 2008 through this book has become much harder .
it makes me yearn for the many promises that have disappeared .
this week i read that part of the book , which describes how clinton dealt a resounding defeat obama in the primary election in pennsylvania .
at a meeting on the review of the failure , he told his staff that they should return to normal and to remain faithful to its purpose .
&quot; i want us to return our attractiveness , - he said .
- we must remember who we are . &quot;
five years have passed , mr. president , and i quite agree with you .
expressed in this commentary are solely opinions nathaniel morris .
in egypt , takes the oath first freely elected president
mohammed mursi takes the oath , but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in egypt .
islamists mohamed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; when brought oath , becoming the first freely elected president , succeeding hosni mubarak , who was ousted 16 months ago .
at his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , mursi also became the first freely elected president of the islamic arab world and the fifth head of state in egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago .
he took the oath before the 18 judges in black robes at the courthouse on the banks of the nile , which was built in the style of an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; - said mursi during the ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , &quot; - said mursi , 60-year-old engineer with the american form of the &quot; muslim brotherhood &quot; , a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization , which served as a target for tough action successive
the building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when mursi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 am local time .
only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president , and , unlike the presidential pomp mubarak era , the traffic was stopped for a short time to let his motorcade on normally busy road connecting the city center with its southern suburbs .
although derided as mursi neharizmatichnoe &quot; spare tire &quot; , &quot; brothers &quot; , his personal prestige has grown dramatically since its victory and friday performances , in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only islamists , but also all those who want to complete the work uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian mubarak .
&quot; today , egypt is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state &quot; , - said mursi , dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie , the judges in the wood-paneled room , where he took the oath .
mursi later went to cairo university , where he was to deliver his inaugural address .
he was given an official reception with military orchestra played the national anthem , during which he stood at &quot; attention . &quot;
attended military leader field marshal hussein tantawi .
his arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot; the army and the people - one hand &quot; , which chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university .
founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , cairo university in the 1970s became a stronghold of islamist student groups .
mursi took a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , the birthplace of the uprising that ended mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and promised to return the powers of the president , which was deprived of his post of the military council , who took the case from the deposed leader .
but by agreeing to take the official oath before the court , and not in front of parliament , as is customary , he does the will of the military , and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue .
it morsi in tahrir square was filled with theatrical populist gestures .
schools urged to pay more attention to math , spelling and grammar
school of english literature courses will require that students have studied at least one shakespeare play , a novel xix century romantic poetry and contemporary british fiction since 1914 .
at the exam will also feature &quot; extracurricular texts &quot; to encourage more extensive reading .
joint course of english literature and language will be canceled .
from 2015 , students will be required to take the final exam in a separate language , with strong recommendations selection of english literature as a separate exam .
the department of education should release tomorrow a new curriculum for english and mathematics - the first subjects subjected to a radical revision .
he will make changes in other essential supplies next year .
separate regulatory body in the field of exams ofqual present a revised structure of final exams of high school , with a new system of values ​ ​ and a smaller volume of coursework .
speaking summer , education minister michael gove said he was &quot; a broad consensus that we need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence , &quot; insisting that the school final examinations will be &quot; more complex , more ambitious and more stringent . &quot;
studies show that english schools devote less time mathematics ( 116 hours per year , or three hours per week during the quarter ) than in most countries .
for comparison - australian schools give on average 143 hours per year , and students in singapore engaged in about 138 hours .
although the formal requirement to spend more time in the schedule is not mathematics , coalition sources said that large-scale school final exams in mathematics combined with improved efficiency ratings in the table are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional training on this subject .
the curriculum will focus more on &quot; real-life problems &quot; , including financial mathematics .
football - reason for discord ?
in the state duma in the &quot; open platform &quot; policy experts talked about how to maintain national peace in russia .
among the proposals was made and such : ban football in the north caucasus because of this game - some scandals and discord .
speaker sergei naryshkin reminded of the recent events in biryulyovo and said to reduce &quot; the degree of tension in society &quot; politicians and the media must be correct in his statements .
perhaps he had in mind the recent scandal with vladimir zhirinovsky , who is one of the television threatened to encircle the caucasus barbed wire , if there do not want to limit births ...
all the speakers talked about the measures to regulate migration from the cis countries , and measures to harmonize relations between the nations of russia , which gave discussions confusion .
maxim grigoriev said that the events in biryulyovo - &quot; conflict model that could predict , &quot; but &quot; for these issues we meet too many people and authorities &quot; , as too many cooks spoil the broth .
the concept of multiculturalism , which has long practiced in europe against migrants , according to volunteers , failed , and should look his way .
historian yury petrov laid great hopes on the new unified history textbook .
&quot; still it is necessary to create a manual on the cultural history of the peoples of the country to students in tatarstan know what kind of people live in dagestan , and vice versa , &quot; - he said .
gennady zyuganov proposed to criminalize &quot; appeals to the dismemberment of russia &quot; : &quot; if the u.s. said on the radio that we must pay russia to alaska , then you will be arrested and will be given 20 years in prison ! &quot;
vladimir zhirinovsky tried very hard &quot; not to inflame . &quot;
as usual , in all he accused journalists who make patients and acute national problems on the public debate : &quot; in the heat of debate , you never know what can we say ! &quot;
the leader of the faction &quot; united russia &quot; vladimir vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude &quot; charter &quot; and agree to conduct discussions on this subject carefully , and then the same obligations can take over and policy .
we made ​ ​ about 30 laws that regulate migration , and order in the whole set , said mr. vasilyev .
as an example , he cited a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory .
but lyudmila andrichenko enthusiasm over this law has not divided : there is no &quot; clear idea of ​ ​ what the adaptation of migrants , its mechanisms and limits .
hence , the subjects will be treated differently scope of these powers .
in addition , municipalities have no training needed to address these complex issues , no money , and guidelines , which they could use , the center does not give them ...
head of the duma committee on nationalities gadzhimet safaraliev proposed to establish a special agency with a formidable name of &quot; homeland security &quot; , which would deal with issues of national policy .
but valery tishkov , who in the 90s led a similar agency abolished later opposed .
enough to have a federal special person , &quot; minister without portfolio &quot; , which could be had , if that .
&quot; we go over the edge , torn shells nearby , very important people of different ethnicities and religions stand together against provocations , and this work should get decent information support &quot; , - said the representative of the russian orthodox church relations society vsevolod chaplin .
no neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies , including religious , to be , in his opinion , it should not .
here oleg nilov led discussion in unexpected direction : &quot; more talented people than in chechnya or dagestan , still need to look for , but they are pushing the wrong way , the wrong way , &quot; - he said .
&quot; not that way &quot; - the development of football : &quot; what football player beat the whole crowd , the flags of the harness , the comrades stones throw of each other ...
maybe we do not need a football ?

recognition of the national security agency reinforce paranoia corporations regarding public surveillance
a warm afternoon in late august , the german police helicopter flew low over the u.s. consulate in frankfurt , germany &apos;s financial capital .
according to the instructions of the federal service protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , germany &apos;s domestic intelligence service , his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building representation from the u.s. , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
german media say bfv hoped to detect antenna listening devices , and these actions have resulted in negotiations between the u.s. and the german foreign office in berlin .
james clapper , director of national intelligence , in september again assured that the united states does not use the foreign intelligence &quot; for theft of trade secrets by foreign companies in the interests of u.s. companies to increase their international competitiveness and increase their profits . &quot;
but since edward snowden - a contract employee , became whistleblower - began to publish his treasury u.s. intelligence secrets , european governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to trust the director &apos;s word .
reports that the u.s. national security agency monitored the brazilian oil company petrobras and gained access to the data stored in cloud services providers in united states , including google and yahoo , corporations raised paranoia caused by shadowing the state to new heights .
the last straw was the news that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone was tapped , perhaps about ten years .
if the most influential person in europe can become a target , of course , are potential targets , and business leaders .
snowden made ​ ​ evident by intensive cooperation between intelligence agencies and u.s. companies .
i think it is likely that these data are used to mutual benefit .
&quot; germany needs to wake up , &quot; - says oliver gruen , president of association bitmi , which represents small and medium-sized it-companies in germany .
german companies are convinced that the united states now represent nearly the same risk as china in the field of industrial espionage and data theft , according to a study published in july by consulting agency ey .
all documents disclosed by mr. snowden , however , still there was no evidence that the united states passed trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians expressed concern that the eu lacks certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the internet , and suggested that he should try to reduce their dependence on the u.s ..
businessmen are skeptical about this .
someone in the german parliament says that we need to create a german google .
i can just close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; this is not an option , &quot; - says plattner gass , president of the german supplier of business software sap .
if there is a need for a strong european it-industry , should not have let her die more than 20 years ago .
all subsidized in germany : from coal to cars and farmers .
all except it-industry .
nevertheless , coverage and technical development agencies espionage u.s. revelations made ​ ​ famous by snowden , came as a shock to some of the companies that had previously thought that the greatest risk of surveillance is china .
major shift occurs in cloud technologies , where the leaders of european companies better realize that the data stored in the u.s. are in the same jurisdiction , and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a study conducted by the trade association cloud security alliance , about 10 percent of its non-us participants abandoned plans to use the services of the us-based provider of cloud after the exposure of the u.s. program for data mining prism .
sneyb jim , one of the executive directors of sap , said : &quot; we see that consumers ask a new question , which did not arise a year ago , namely : where is my data stored and whether you can ensure that they remain physically in this jurisdiction . &quot;
many german leaders argue that the latest reports - it &apos;s just a confirmation of what they already knew : the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets , and therefore , these data should be protected at all costs .
what happens economic espionage - is not surprising .
he always had a place .
&quot; it was a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy , &quot; - said kurt bock , ceo of chemical company basf .
americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level , and we also spy on them , because it is in our national interest - to protect our businesses .
corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about those responses that they have taken , as it may provide an advantage to the enemy .
large companies have long been assimilated the idea that stick to take a free exhibition or leave the laptop unattended in a hotel room - it is at least imprudent .
ulrich hackenberg , member of the board of directors carmaker audi , said that for many years it is standard practice - to collect mobile phones before the meetings of the board , that they can not be used as listening devices .
federal protection service of the german constitution recommends that ceos consider using simple prepaid cell phones during a trip abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones .
prepaid cell phones are thrown out later .
nevertheless , there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are leaders in the world market in its particular niche .
&quot; small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access &quot; - warns in a report bfv .
u.s. warns their own company on economic espionage from other countries .
updated u.s. national intelligence in february put france with russia and israel in the second series of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence , after china , according to the washington post .
member of the board of directors of the prestigious german company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the worst of all the french . &quot;
skarsini bernard , the former head of the french domestic intelligence agency dcri , reportedly said in an interview this month : &quot; services are well aware that all countries , even when they work together in the fight against terrorism , spying on its allies . &quot;

reaction of the police chief david became kimayo call two journalists and media officer for questioning , even though the call was canceled after mass protests media .

after accusations of bad taste yevgenia vasilyeva spoke
yevgenia vasilyeva , to the person that almost a year riveted attention of the media , still never commented numerous publications in the press as of embezzlement in the ministry of defense , and for her personally - a relationship with former defense minister anatoly serdyukov , her poetry and passion to valuable things .
however , on november 1 supernumerary case &quot; oboronservis &quot; broke the silence .
in an interview with life news vasilyeva said : &quot; initially , of course , was exactly one task : to pull me out of any negative information against the former minister of defense . &quot;
was blackmail for what i should give testimony , or i go to jail .
to date , these threats stopped .
next we go to court , will prove his innocence .
in the victory , we believe 100 percent .
in this interview , we can conclude that , perhaps , the most vasilyev touched words that she does not matter tasteful .
probably refers to the spokesperson sc vladimir markin that the collection of paintings , which collects business supernumerary &quot; oboronservis &quot; , showed a fake .
among the seized property has a series of pictures that hostess , being confident in his deep knowledge of art , acquired as the masterpieces of world art .
however art expertise , appointed investigators after his arrest these paintings , found that they have no artistic value and , quite simply , are cheap imitations , &quot; - said markin in early october .
some paintings stolen from the ministry of defence ...
later still admitted that they are not stolen from the ministry of defense , while told me bad taste .
who has the right to discuss my taste , discuss some personal moments ?
in my opinion , it &apos;s just a mess , &quot; - said vasilyev .
in this case the question of whether she admits guilt in at least one of the 12 charges against her criminal episodes , vasilyeva said : &quot; of course not .
recognize nothing at all .
moreover , there is no damage to the russian federation in question .
simply enter people into error , that &apos;s all .
in addition , in response to today &apos;s announcement rf ic that vasileva evades study materials of the criminal case , the lawyer supernumerary said that he and his client &quot; does not give the investigator familiar with the case . &quot;
what was the reason to the revelations under house arrest vasilyeva , still do not talk to the press ?
perhaps as a woman she could not help but respond to the accusation of bad taste ?
or the right of journalists &quot; komsomolskaya pravda &quot; , asserted a few days ago that she &quot; fell into a trance even more under house arrest &quot; because of the news of reconciliation with his wife of anatoly serdyukov and his return to the bosom of the family ?
known military commentator &quot; kp &quot; victor baranez in his article &quot; serdyukov returned to his wife ? &quot; wrote : &quot; investigators do not rule out that after such a shock , it may become more talkative during interrogations . &quot;
earlier vasilyeva some charges in the illegal sale of real estate mod took over .

eser offers equated to extremism insult patriotic feelings
legislative protection for patriotic feelings of the citizens of russia against provocations and insults &quot; fair russia &quot; offers an insult to equate patriotism for extremist activities and punish it by five years in prison .
according to the newspaper &quot; izvestia &quot; , such amendments to the legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the duma committee on energy oleg mikheev , have been sent for opinion to the supreme court and the government .

as pointed out by mikheyev , in domestic law have sanctions for abuse of formal features of state power - the flag and coat of arms .
at the same time , according to the mp , the protection of russians , whose feelings may be hurt and insult to the state symbols , and other manifestations of disrespect for our country , worked in the russian legislation is not enough .
as an example , he cites the unfolding each year on the eve of victory day controversy when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the ussr in the fight against the nazis .
on the eve of the main public holiday - victory day may 9 - year unfolds real orgy .
practicing wit and &quot; alternative view &quot; on the story , some publicists reach arguments that , say , what a pity that the germans did not win the cultural wild soviet union !
i think this is unacceptable in a country where pride in the history remains the main &quot; spiritual clamp of &quot; nation &quot; - outraged oleg mikheev .
in addition , according to mikheev , patriotic people in russia much more than religious , however , the law punishes insult to the feelings of believers , and to insult the patriotic feelings can almost with impunity .

while serving as a state duma deputy from the &quot; apple &quot; , he developed a law regulating the pmc .
council should vote for op compounds pmc 43 regions of the country .
1,800 vacancies claim thousands less willing , and in ingushetia and kabardino-balkaria contests failed to organize because of the lack of candidates .
eta promises to organize extension dialing for vacancies .
pmc moscow - one of the few commissions with the competition , despite the fact that in the new structure will be 40 instead of 20 participants .
according borscheva , in the current metropolitan commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces , but in the version that is on the ballot in the op , the ratio changed to 17 to 23 .
in the metropolitan commission wanted to get 30 defenders .
but in the new composition can re-enter the representative &quot; combat brotherhood &quot; vyacheslav kalinin .
he was a member of three years , the pmc , but never visited the prisoners .
borschev believes that the security forces , appointing its chairman of the pmc will be able to do the work of human rights defenders unbearable , so defenders do not exclude the collective output of the commission .
according to them , the promotion of a member of the security forces coordinate onc anton tsvetkov , who heads the &quot; officers of russia &quot; - an organization defending the interests of law enforcement agencies .
&quot; i do not eat babies for breakfast &quot; , - told rbc daily anton tsvetkov .
he denies that any lobbying promotion lists and said that is not going to prevent human rights defenders to visit arrested oppositionists .
according to tsvetkov , he was not even interested , in what is now my vote in the op .
promulgation borschev information he considers a form of pressure .
possible success of defenders - planned change in leadership chelyabinsk pmc .
her former executives get suspended because of last year &apos;s unrest kopeyskoye .
in the public chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners .
but pmc rostov-on-don can move from human rights to security officials .
new lists of &quot; disappeared &quot; human rights-chairman of the local committee , but it turned out to be one of his opponents , despite the fact that in may 2013 the federal public chamber excluded it for unethical behavior .
moscow and rostov lists commissions borschev believes &quot; revenge for kopejsk . &quot;
hope tolokonnikova revelations did not affect pmc mordovia , which is considered &quot; power &quot; : the new composition of wanted to get only one human rights activist , and she did not even receive documents for the competition .
councilman eta nikolai svanidze told rbc daily , that he voted against the proposed list , as it disturbs the situation in moscow and rostov-on-don .

shrouded in secret national security agency said friday evening that the cessation of their site for a few hours caused the technical glitch , not hackers , as stated in the network .
« nsa.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; - said the intelligence agency in an official email .
problem will be solved tonight .
statements that outage was caused by a distributed attack like &quot; denial of service » &#91; ddos &#93; , are incorrect .
earlier tonight on-line monitoring system servers notified the nsa &apos;s not working at least six hours and the site is still available to some users .
earlier , the nsa told abc news , that the internal network of secret agency &quot; not &quot; has been hacked .
no classified information is not in danger , a spokesman .
at least one online group of hackers activists stated that it is responsible for the decommissioning of the site nsa using ddos-attack .
ddos-attacks designed to overwhelm the targeted website traffic as servers are not overloaded and the site does not fail .
relatively simple tactic hackers and attacks are not designed to penetrate into the internal network of the target system .
previously , the super-secret nsa , once earned the nickname &quot; no such agency &quot; appeared in recent months in the public eye and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically - all a reaction to the nsa &apos;s secret files stolen from agency and published by the former disappointed

gazprom ceo alexei miller said that the pipeline in bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
construction of the pipeline &quot; south stream &quot; in bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in europe , the head of gazprom .
&quot; today is a milestone event happened : the construction of the bulgarian section of the pipeline &quot; south stream &quot; , the most large-scale and important project in europe &quot; , - said chairman of gazprom , alexei miller , said in a statement on thursday .
this project is a key element of energy security of the european continent .
&quot; south stream &quot; is intended to diversify export routes for russia through europe .
contract dispute between gazprom and its partners in ukraine , which is a large part of the gas destined for europe russia raises the level of risk for conventional routes , officials say .
miller said that a direct connection with bulgaria , a member of the european union means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries , eliminated &quot; forever . &quot;
bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the &quot; south stream &quot; at a reduced price , as soon as in 2015 , the entire project will work .
gazprom said that construction should begin in other countries located further along the route of the pipeline by the end of the year .
annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
agency &quot; rosbalt &quot; deprived of the status of mass media for swearing
october 31 moscow city court ruled to invalidate the license of registration agency &quot; rosbalt &quot; - wrote &quot; tape &quot; .
lishenii status of media agencies insisted roskomnadzor - for sistematicheskie and grubыe law violations against the media .
during the process was created bad precedent : the court found it possible to close the media , in fact denying the right to publish anti arguments .
what is &quot; rosbalt &quot;
jsc &quot; rosbalt news agency &quot; was established in st. petersburg in 2000 .
in subsequent years , the agency opened a second headquarters in new york and a number of regional offices .
also , the agency has representative offices in countries of the former ussr .
since 2001 , &quot; rosbalt &quot; developed and functioned as a federal information-analytical agency .
by the mid-2000s , the agency included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in russia .
thus &quot; rosbalt &quot; always held a rather specific niche : the kernel exclusive agency publications were ( and still make ) notes , citing sources in law enforcement .
talk about proximity to power structures editions continued throughout the existence of the agency .
along with the fact that &quot; rosbalt &quot; possessed extensive database sources in various departments , in favor of such assumptions is the fact that the project was headed by natalia chaplin - wife of viktor cherkesov .
the role of chaplin in the &quot; rosbalt &quot; is not completely clear : most often it is called &quot; project manager &quot; .
director general of the agency is larisa afonina , editor in chief - nikolai ulyanov .
recently &quot; rosbalt &quot; did not appear in the rankings of federal media - either on the citation or audience .
in october , the agency took 25 th place in the ranking of websites are visited by russian media version liveinternet .
according to the same liveinternet , average audience rosbalt.ru site is about 150 million unique visitors ( up to 500 thousand views ) , monthly - about three million unique visitors .
among the most popular materials for the last five months - notes on the helplessness of the kremlin in its relations with ukraine , the death of lead singer of &quot; the king and the clown &quot; , riots in the capital biryulyovo .
conflict &quot; rosbalta &quot; with roscomnadzor began in july 2013 when , amendments to the media law , ban journalists obscenities .
office finds forbidden language in two published on the agency website videos ( &quot; horseman of krasnodar &quot; and &quot; pussy riot desecrated oil rigs &quot; ) .
further side describe differently .
roscomnadzor based on the detected video blamed &quot; rosbalt &quot; in gross and systematic violation of the media law and asked the court to deprive the agency license .
in &quot; rosbalt &quot; stated that the agency claims are illegal : first , the rollers were not editorial content , and secondly , swear words in them were masked , and , thirdly , immediately after the warning videos were removed from the site .
representatives of the agency appealed claims roskomnadzora in the magistrate &apos;s court - and when october 22 , 2013 the moscow city court has accepted the lawsuit roskomnadzora , consideration of these complaints still pending .
however , the 25th day of the magistrate decided not in favor of &quot; rosbalt &quot; : chief editor nikolai ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and fined 20,000 rubles - 10 thousand for each movie .
obviously , it prejudge the outcome of the moscow city court hearing - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could be a foregone conclusion even earlier .
october 31 the court decided to annul the certificate of registration &quot; rosbalt &quot; , effectively blocking media agency status .
can not say that &quot; rosbalt &quot; during this confrontation remained alone .
agency supported by deputies of the state duma ( application to the head of alexander zharov roskomnadzora october 10 signed by 26 deputies , the document was served on the initiative of the communist party ) .
about illegality closing publication stated head of the union of journalists of russia vsevolod bogdanov , chairman of the moscow union of journalists and pavel gusev , head of the presidential council on human rights mikhail fedotov .
moreover , according to bogdanov , guide roskomnadzora even gave him some assurance that the revocation of the license before it will not come .
the trial of &quot; rosbalt &quot; showed : under whose jurisdiction be safer media in russia today - the big question .
gene speech proved stimulant synapse formation
scientists at the johns hopkins university school of medicine and mount sinai discovered protein , through which &quot; speech gene &quot; foxp2 performs its function , stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons .
the research is published in science , online magazine you can read the summary .
foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to the speech .
establish its role succeeded in 2001 by the discovery of the family of the few people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes do not even understand each other .
scientists have found that family members were disrupted gene foxp2 , but how it performs its function remained unknown .
the new biological study showed that at least part of its functions as a stimulator foxp2 performs formation of new synapses in brain regions associated with the production of speech .
he accomplishes this through another gene , srpx2 .
the latter was observed as a result of search factors which stimulate synapse formation .
srpx2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors , with only its activity viyaet foxp2 .
what really affects srpx2 vocalizations , scientists confirmed in experiments on mice .
when animal gene activity was artificially reduced , they are less screaming in the separation from the mother .
if the activity of the gene was reduced , restored and published frequency sounds .
earlier in mice has also been demonstrated touch with vocalization of the foxp2 .
animals that received a copy of the human gene , squeaking and actively at a lower frequency than the conventional mouse .
until now , however , scientists do not know whether work related foxp2 and , accordingly , they managed srpx2 purely &quot; mechanical &quot; properties education sounds or thinner processes .

glowing in the dark want ice cream ?
british entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first ice cream glows in the dark with the help of a jellyfish .
charlie francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop a glowing food .
he came to this idea after reading a scientific article on jellyfish , and convinced scientists in china chemically recreate glowing protein .
ice cream reacts with the language of him who eats , increasing the ph of the protein and causing it to glow .
chris said that , as the ice cream begins to glow when reacting to the heat of the mouth , it means that the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of ice cream &quot; lick me , i &apos;m delicious , &quot; says : &quot; it &apos;s an incredible thing , but still at a very early stage , when it comes to production , so for £ 200 you get about 2 g of the substance . &quot;
protein , which we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral ph .
therefore , when your mouth is warm white , it will raise the ph level and ice cream will begin to glow .
we tested it in the past few months , and it seemed that would be perfect to submit it to halloween , because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect .
this is probably the most expensive ice cream from those that i did , because jellyfish luminescence four times more expensive than gold .
so that each ball cost me about £ 140 .
but it is quite pleasant to the taste .
experimental charlie company , located in bristol , famous for its unusual flavors , including beer , cheese , beef and the taste of gold leaf .
but his next creation should be more ambitious .
he said : &quot; i really want to develop the invisible ice cream . &quot;
it is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up the ice cream , but i think we &apos;ll find a way to do it .
ice cream uses fluorescent properties jellyfish synthesized by chinese scientists

analysts believe that this method of reverse gas supplies to ukraine may be used only for a few weeks , and will likely lead to a decrease in shipments to other regions .
&quot; between the eu and the ukrainians held talks on how to create favorable conditions for ukraine could import gas from other sources and not from russia , or from the same source , but other routes , &quot; - said the source told reuters .

syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
syria had destroyed all the declared capacity for the production of chemical weapons , recognized organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
this first stage of disarmament damascus completed the day before the deadline .
before november 1 , syria had destroyed industrial and other ancillary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use , reports bbc bbc .
destruction of stockpiles of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components to be completed by mid-2014 .
according to the opcw , currently toxic chemicals are in sealed vaults .
international inspectors went to syria after the outskirts of damascus on august 21 during a chemical attack were killed , according to the united states , more than 1,400 people .
the main task of the inspectors was no time to lose - not to allow the syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and weaponization .
these production facilities will now be closely watched to prevent their repair .
the next milestone - mid-november , by this time the opcw and the syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances .
there are many questions .
where will they be destroyed ?
who will provide for this equipment ?
all applications will be carefully syrian checked by western intelligence agencies .
they readily advise inspectors new objects to check if there are grounds to suspect that damascus is not completely honest .
the united states believes that the shooting was carried out by regular troops .
syria and russia insist that it is the handiwork of the syrian rebels .
the world community demanded that the syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of russia , - destroy or rendered unusable all the capacity to produce shells , poisonous gases and liquids and for filling shells these substances .
now , when this stage is complete , the next step should be the elimination of an existing chemical weapons in the syrian army .
it is assumed that in this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents , blister agents mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different places .
to destroy it is necessary that the opcw and the syrian authorities agreed on a timetable for the start of action - it is given two weeks .
head of field operations opcw jerry smith told the bbc bbc that his inspectors &quot; personally oversaw the destruction of equipment . &quot;
&quot; now they have no possibility to further production or mixing of chemical weapons &quot; , - he said .
in a statement , the opcw said that inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in syria and made sure that the factories producing shells and toxic substances either destroyed or made ​ ​ unusable .
the remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out inspection there , says the document , but the equipment was transported from there and checked by experts of the opcw .
according to smith , the destruction of infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was &quot; particularly uneasy &quot; because work had in the context of the ongoing conflict .
in early october , the opcw has received the nobel peace prize , but , according to smith , it is time to celebrate the inspectors had not yet found - they were too busy working .
george kerewan : the gap with europe gives scots choice
another day , another horror story about independence .
at this time , we are warned that an independent scotland would have to join the pan-european area of free movement as a condition for eu membership .
comes the turn of stories about the passport control at berwick and the border with barbed wire along hadrian &apos;s wall .
however , strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of freer movement to the rest of europe , though - predictably - it does not appear in the headlines .
and no one has pointed out that the eu member states spend a lot of time trying to turn their formal rules as it suits them .
because scotland is now not part of the schengen zone , continued non-compliance will be cheap concession to brussels instead of what he really wanted from the scots .
so it &apos;s not a worthwhile story .
and so old that it has become a fossil : the first time i heard &quot; duck &quot; that &quot; independence means passport control , &quot; at least 40 years ago .
yet there is an interesting point , lost in the retelling of old tales .
why does an independent scotland should execute orders in europe ?
why change the yoke yoke london brussels , especially now ?
that &apos;s true european news : the great postwar plan to unify europe finally stalled .
with the euro crisis project &quot; europe &quot; is officially dead .
throughout the european union parties opposed to the abolition of the eu or the euro as the single currency gaining strength .
even in germany eurosceptic party &quot; alternative for germany &quot; - founded only this year - came out of nowhere and got almost five million votes in september &apos;s federal elections , thus essentially displacing &quot; free democrats &quot; ( the analogue of our &apos; liberal democracy &apos; ) of the bundestag .
there has always been internal opposition plan creating a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis was a turning point .
the austerity measures introduced by berlin and the european central bank , and the shackles imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency , have led many people to believe that the project &quot; europe &quot; has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for greece .
in fact , the eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates , favorable for german exporters - that german politicians and want to keep .
without the possibility of devaluation is in southern europe in advance disadvantage manufacturing capabilities in comparison with germany .
the only recourse - to cut down salaries and public spending that is actively supported by berlin .
for current budget problems and currency worth a deeper problem of productive capacities in europe .
as a result , a set of measures to &quot; green &quot; energy embedded brussels - code meaning subsidizing french and german energy companies at the expense of the consumer - the european industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the u.s ..
this paralyzing adverse price conditions , as we have seen in grangemouth .
no freezing wages in the world will not stop a landslide of cheap shale gas on the u.s. european petrochemical industry .
as a result of brewing rebellion , especially in france , once the most ardent supporter of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite views the eu as a way to control germany and paris put on a par with washington .
but berlin is no longer needed in paris as a means to gain political legitimacy , and has imposed its own economic policy to europe , leaving a devastated economy of france in distress .
result - generally against the eu party marine le pen &quot; national front &quot; has just won the crucial by-election , the ruling party of socialists dropping to third place .
&quot; front &quot; is now the most popular party in france , with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning by the british labour party that can not proceed on the assumption that the split among the right automatically affect in favor of the left .
what makes le pen with his newfound popularity among french white working class ?
she wants to use the elections to the eu next year to create a block in the european parliament against the eu and against the single currency .
if - and it is very likely - the party opposed to the eu will be supported in this election , the first time such a unit can occupy a dominant position in the european parliament .
here &apos;s my take : soon growing sentiment against the eu and against the single currency in europe will merge together to destroy the euro .
eu will not disappear , but it will again be a bit vague &quot; europe ( sovereign ) nations &quot; that appealed to general de gaulle .
germany and several dependents economies may save the euro , but france and southern europe to restore their own currencies .
i guess britain is distancing itself from the project , hoping to get closer to the united states .
nevertheless , the growing interest of washington to the pacific ocean indicates the likelihood that the uk will remain unattended in the cold atlantic .
in what position does that leave scotland ?
we can choose to become the region ( in fact ) little england .
or we can to protect their own economic interests , which means , among other things , send berlin and brussels to hell .
i suspect that scotland will be able to succeed as part of a free european agreement provided that we keep its currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider the possibility of repetition of the experience of norway and the preservation of our economic independence .
the government of the scottish national party in scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful political movement in europe directed against austerity measures , which received an impressive majority in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by the labour chancellor of the exchequer
scotland would be absurd now to vote for independence only to accept austerity measures imposed by berlin and brussels .

early puberty : before aging
african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts , research shows .
physical changes do not mean that puberty close
there is no evidence that the blame hormones or other chemicals
experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge - journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
should the mother scared if her daughter begin to form the beginnings of breast and pubic hair to grow at 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , fla . , children &apos;s endocrinologist dr. paul kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among american women and are the new norm .
&quot; i spend a lot of time reassuring parents - usually it does not mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity , &quot; - said kaplovitts .
obvious signs of development , such as growing breasts , pubic and axillary hair and body odor , appear earlier in girls .
but there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche ( first menstruation ) over the past four decades .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , and decreased compared to 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; once the breasts begin to develop , passes through at least two or three years before menarche , &quot; - said kaplovitts , who is also author of the book &quot; early puberty in girls : how to deal with this common problem . &quot;
time - the most accurate test of how puberty will progress .
there is debate about what is the actual onset of puberty , but it is &quot; premature &quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years .
in most cases , the process will stop or slow down - this is what the pediatrician may monitor carefully .
more rapid progression can serve as a basis for analysis by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts .
there are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence : premature aging of the bones , which ultimately can lead to stunted growth and low growth into adulthood .
recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy based on the child &apos;s age , level of development , growth and emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplovitts careful with medications , but acknowledges that &quot; the suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of the girls that they are different from peers . &quot;
another big problem is clear : parents just do not want to have their very young daughters were menstruating .
&quot; they are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will cope with health issues , &quot; - said kaplovitts .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; - says one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10 .
although there were signs and we talked about menstruation , she was not emotionally ready .
she came home from school frightened and upset by the fact that she was the first among his friends .
there are many theories about the causes publicized early puberty .
nevertheless , there is no consistent evidence that the blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual promises in the media .
the boys - like girls - puberty occurs earlier .
kaplovitts argues that the premise , which is the most significant - is the epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 , he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years , which relates the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty .
other evidence supports this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .
there are various explanations .
worldwide , precocious puberty , appear to affect all from the economic climate conditions and to the genes .
another mystery : although boys facial hair and pubic hair appear at a younger age , the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
other physicians participating in the conference aap , confirmed the complexity of the subject .
acne and pubic hair found even in infants and toddlers .
&quot; we must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty , &quot; - said dr. lawrence silverman , children &apos;s endocrinologist at children &apos;s hospital in gorieb morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk to your child .
&quot; this could mean an earlier than expected , the conversation &quot; - explained kaplovitts .
if you keep quiet , your child will usually respond well .
girls who blossom early , you need to confirm that even when it comes ahead of this process is a normal part of life .

rbs dismisses two currency traders
royal bank of scotland was suspended two traders work in his unit on foreign currency transactions , according to two people familiar with the situation , which is another proof that the global review of regulators alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world &apos;s largest financial market , the daily turnover is $ 5.3 trillion .
these two are the first members of the trader rbs , excluded in the unfolding investigation , which resonates with the scandal involving the manipulation of the interbank rate libor .
declined to comment on the suspension , the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; our ongoing investigation of this issue is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with the fca and our other regulators &quot; - the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , the knowledgeable person said that rbs gave an e-mail and instant messages he received and sent his former trader , uk regulators - office for monitoring financial activity ( fca ) .
this trader , richard asher , left rbs in 2010 and as far as we know , he granted leave his current post of the head of european currency spot trading in jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading in citi , went on vacation this week , while matt gardiner , a former senior currency trader at barclays and ubs , was removed from his standard chartered bank this week .
none of these traders was not accused of any wrongdoing .
contact group instant messaging mr. asher included bankers from barclays and citigroup , according to knowledgeable people .
ubs bank reported this week that he had taken action against some of its employees after the swiss regulator finma said he investigates alleged manipulation in the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six regulatory agencies in the world - the european commission , finma , swiss competition authority weko , fca , the u.s. justice department and the hong kong monetary authority - consider allegations that bankers colluded to influence the currency market .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also naca interior inspections or received queries about providing information with side reguliruûŝih organov , say znakomyi with situaciej people .
banks viewed instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of offenses .
news on inspections rocked traders in the sphere of activity is , in recent years one of the largest sources of income trading desks of investment banks , which this year , however , ran into difficulties because the low volatility of exchange reduces the opportunities for resellers .
some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation , saying that extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market is practically impossible to manipulate , but the older traders say that this is not always true .
according to a senior trader , despite the huge volume of daily trading on the currency market , the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and wider use by banks of their internal platforms &quot; means that you can start to have an impact on the market for a very small price . &quot;
this news came on the same day when the bank credit suisse announced that fired one of its traders of stock trading on the london stock exchange this week , after he had caused a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank shall promptly notify the relevant authorities and is working with its regulators .
&quot; we are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue could be located , &quot; - said credit suisse .

john kerry said in his unprecedented recognition that the u.s. espionage &quot; went far unsuitable &quot;
john kerry demonstrated mitigation tactics protection programs monitor u.s. by making unprecedented recognition that in some cases the u.s. espionage &quot; unsuitable went away . &quot;
the secretary also admitted that he was guilty , along with barack obama , that was &quot; on autopilot &quot; during the generation of loud denunciations of edward snowden nsa spying activities .
these leaks have put the u.s. government in the center of the diplomatic scandal with its allies .
speaking by video link on open government conference in london , mr kerry said : &quot; there is no doubt that the president and i , as well as other members of the government actually adopted some things happening on autopilot , because such a possibility already existed - and during world war ii , and in very difficult years of the cold war , and , of course , 11
then he became the first high-ranking member of the u.s. government to recognize that the u.s. espionage has gone too far , but stressed that no one &apos;s rights were not violated .
he said : &quot; in some cases , this has gone far unsuitable .
and the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain to the people , and now conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one had the feeling of abuse .
i assure you , the abuse of innocent people in the process no . &quot;
mr. kerry insisted , however , that the nsa acted in good faith and that the tracking operation saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we are in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up .
in the world there is a radical extremism , reckless and determined to kill people , blow up people and attack the government .

meanwhile , u.s. lawmakers will head to europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged espionage u.s. and abroad to convince europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with u.s. anti-terrorist measures , said the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs on thursday .
connecticut sen. chris murphy said he spoke with members of the european parliament and others this week and is concerned about threats to stop their participation in anti-terrorist organizations out of frustration due to the surveillance conducted by the national security agency .

news that the nsa has collected millions of records of telephone conversations in europe worsened relations with some u.s. allies , even though the agency &apos;s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata that is collected by the allies , and they shared with the united states .
in other revelations cited snowden released documents showing that the nsa monitored the mobile phone with german chancellor angela merkel , as well as phones about 34 other world leaders .
director of national intelligence james clapper defended espionage activities against the allies as a necessary and said that it is quite common on both sides .

names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days .
according to him , the trip program is still under development .
although murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to promote the improvement of relations , he said , that some degree of &quot; rigidity intentioned &quot; will also be manifested .
he said that european leaders need to be honest with his people in what spyware they have used for many years .
&quot; while we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities &quot; - said murphy .

when i was a kid , halloween was magical .
me and my sister were allowed to eat sweets , do not stay up late and go to masquerade parties for our district .
now i &apos;m more like a miser .
i was not called in the past two years to distribute candy in his apartment and likely will not this year .
however , statistics show that i &apos;m the black sheep in regard to halloween .
according to the national retail federation , the majority of americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate halloween this year , and will spend a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes and decorations .
the only thing i &apos;m waiting every halloween - this trend .
the national retail federation predicts that for the costumes will take $ 1.2 billion from $ 6.9 billion spent
this year , at the height of fashion sexy inanimate objects .
women no longer have to be a representative of sexual professions , they can also be sexy food , such as pizza , burgers or carrots .
as for men , i think we will see a lot of zombies due to the &quot; walking dead &quot; and i &apos;m sure the astronauts in the style of the group daft punk get into our tape instagram this year .
according to google , the costumes , who are looking increasingly likely - it &apos;s zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach .
we dressed up our dogs in the past year and , to my surprise , we were not the only ones .
moreover , according to the national retail federation , americans will spend this year , $ 330 million on costumes for pets .
this means a lot of funny dogs hot dogs .
when it comes to sweets , we do not trifle .
americans spend on their $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the company nielsen .
it is about 600 million pounds of chocolate hershey , candy , candy milk duds , twizzlers candy and chewing bars clark bar .
according to the u.s. department of commerce , this is great news for the 41 million children demanding candy , which were ready to conquer our neighborhoods .
moreover , we buy and - not kid ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during halloween .
the only thing we do not want to use - is in the form of candy corn kernels , and yet , according to the national confectioners association , nearly 35 million pounds sold under their halloween .
that &apos;s roughly 9 billion individual kernels of corn .
it is a mystery that i have yet to unravel .
there is nothing that expresses the essence of halloween as a haunted house .
they have great names , such as &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is a real prison ) , &quot; howl and cry &quot; and &quot; house of shock . &quot;
moreover , according to the society america haunts , in america there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses , generating nearly $ 500 million in revenue , as well as those stunning photographs , where you almost peed that your friend posted on facebook , and you can not remove and then the guy that you like , see this photo and leave a comment like &quot; cool facial expression . &quot;
and finally , let &apos;s talk about pumpkins .
charlie brown introduced us to the great pumpkin , when we were kids , and carving jack lamp - it &apos;s like christmas tree decoration , what do we do with childhood .
luckily for us , the fashion for baby in a pumpkin began only last year thanks to pinterest , so that most of us grew up , carving pumpkins these , rather than sitting in them .
according to the u.s. census bureau , this year americans will spend about $ 106 million on a pumpkin .
lamp jack slowly drying on your porch , probably came from illinois , who raised this year , 542 million pounds of pumpkins .
if you want the job more difficult , visit tim and susan metisdon in napa california and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds .

the owners of pawnshops in singapore is doing well , while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
in a pawn shop in a shopping mall in singapore bendemir janani amirthalinga lays the golden bracelet , ring and earrings to pay for his daughter &apos;s schooling .
&quot; my husband and i just bought a house , so that all my money is invested there , &quot; - says ms. amirthalinga .
although she earns s $ 3,000 ( $ 2,400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband also works , the monthly income of the family is not enough , she says .
indeed , the demand in various parts of southeast asia - where the amount of household debt grows - is that valuemax , where she spends her deal this week became the third pawnshop registered in the stock exchange of singapore .
loan against jewelry - it &apos;s not just a quick way to get money ( s $ 1,300 in the case of ms. amirthalinga ) , but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
usually pawn shops in singapore accrue effective annual interest rate of 17 % - just above the 15.4 % offered by the department of united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in the same mall .
however , pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can provide loans faster than banks .
why millions of people across the region are turning to pawn shops as families feel the pressure due to the increased cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt .
after five years of steady growth following the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fueled free monetary policy in developed economies , families with low and middle income countries are turning to pawn shops to compensate for reduced revenues as slowing the growth of their economies .
this week , standard &amp; poor &apos;s , the rating agency , has indicated an increase in family leverage , mainly due to rising mortgage as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
it stated that malaysia , thailand and singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia topped the list with 80 % of gdp , compared with 60 % in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week just came out of a technical recession .
on thursday , data showed continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand .
&quot; the bottom line is that with rising prices people in the middle and lower part &#91; of the income scale &#93; will look for ways to supplement their income , where only can &quot; - said song seng wun , an economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the haste with which people are pawning their belongings , as they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations .
in singapore , about 70 % of the things pledged 200 lombard city-state points are gold products .
people say , &quot; the price of gold looks good , let &apos;s lay a gold chain grandma and get it back next month . &quot;
in thailand , the largest operator of pawnshops easymoney observed increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months , up to 20 % .
growth in lombard business is that valuemax , operator offices in bendemire and 15 others like it in singapore , plans to expand not only in neighboring malaysia , where it has four stores , but also outside of asia too , says yeah lee ching , executive director valuemax .
the company will finance the expansion , using 60 percent of s $ 66 million raised this week as a result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of singapore .
while some lenders have caused the fire of criticism because of high interest rates , ms. yeah says pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not increase the debt itself .
&quot; customers are laying items that they already have , and the monetization of personal assets do not increase household debt , &quot; - she says .
mortgage gaining wider public recognition as a means of short-term secured financing .
and while pawnshops enjoy not only the categories of people who are in dire financial straits .
rich in singapore branch also use valuemax , laying gold bullion or watches rolex , which can produce up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash .
we see clients from all walks of life .
&quot; they include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period for commercial projects or investments , or small businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties , &quot; - says ms. yeah .
sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

black box in your car ?
while american designers roads trying to find money to repair crumbling highway system , many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box , the additionally neatly on the dashboard of your car .
these devices that keep track of every mile passing motorists and transmit this information to officials at the center of controversial attempts to modernize the outdated system of financing of motorways america undertaken by planners and washington state .
usually boring arena planning highways suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances .
libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying the government to provide the right to use small boxes to keep track of the amount of miles we pass you , and maybe even where you drive through them - and then use this information in the preparation of tax bills .
tea party movement in shock .
american civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy .
and although congress still can not agree whether to continue or not , several states are not going to wait .
they ponder how in the next decade can go to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road , which they pass .
thousands of motorists have already taken to test these black boxes , some of which have the function of satellite tracking .
is it really necessary for our country .
&quot; this is not an issue on which we may be the right choice , &quot; - said ihrata hassan , executive director of the government of southern california , which is preparing plans to start tracking the state authorities miles , passing each motorist california , in 2025 .
there will be changes in how we pay these taxes .
technology for this already .
the necessity of this is compounded by a lack of funds from government funds highway construction , financed by taxes that americans pay at the gas station .
americans do not buy as much gasoline as before .
cars drive more miles per gallon .
sam federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon , have not been raised for 20 years .
politicians do not want to raise taxes even one cent at high gasoline prices .
&quot; the gas tax is simply impossible to save , &quot; - said mannich lee , an expert on transportation policy at the university of minnesota .
in his state was recently installed on 500 vehicles tracking devices for system testing pomilnoy payment .
&quot; this is the best alternative in the long term &quot; , - he said .
nerds call it pomilnoy user fee .
not surprisingly , this idea attracts urban liberals , since that tax can change the nature of travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
planning agencies in california are looking at this system in the development of strategies to achieve the targets set ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming .
however , rep. bill shuster ( r. , pa . ) , chairman of the house transportation committee , said he , too , considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative .
proponents of the free market in the fund « reason » also delighted by the fact that force drivers to pay for every mile .
&quot; this is not just a tax that will go into a black hole , &quot; - said adrian moore , vice president of political affairs reason .
people just pay for what they get .
this movement is also supported by two former transport ministers of the u.s. , which in 2011 called on congress to move towards pomilnoy payment .
the u.s. senate approved last year pilot project worth $ 90 million , which would be attended by about 10,000 cars .
but the leaders of the house of representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life often have to pass a lot of miles to get to work or to the city .
several states and cities , however , go along this path alone .
the greatest enthusiasm manifested in oregon , where to participate in the largest experiment in the country involved 5000 drivers .
these drivers will soon pay staff for a mile run instead of the gasoline tax .
in nevada , a pilot project has been completed .
in new york , it is considered .
illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks .
a coalition of i-95 , which includes transportation departments in 17 states east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , examines how they can make these changes .
this concept has not received universal acceptance .
in nevada , where about 50 cars volunteers have recently been equipped with these devices , drivers were worried that the government can track their every move .
&quot; concerns about the &quot; big brother &quot; and things like that is a big problem , &quot; - said alauddin khan , head of strategy and performance management in the department of transportation nevada .
it was not what people wanted .
when tests were in full swing , branch of the american civil liberties union in nevada warned on its website : &quot; it &apos;s not hard to turn these devices in full tracking devices . &quot;
no need to create a huge , unwieldy technology infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep track of the daily movements of individual citizens .
nevada - one of the few states where the elusive search conducted low-cost technology that would allow the state government to keep records of passing vehicles miles , but no information about the time and place .
if you can do it , khan said , society will feel more relaxed .
search of this technology has led some state agencies to small young company in california called true mileage .
originally , the company was not involved in the promotion of tax collection staff .
she tried to enter the growing market of the form of auto insurance , in which drivers pay based on mileage .
but the device , which it tests , attract designers roads because they do not use gps and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with a modem .
&quot; people will be more inclined to do this if you do not track their speed and do not track their location , &quot; - said ryan morrison , ceo of true mileage .
there were several large errors in some of these pilot programs of the state .
there are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do it .
in oregon , designers are experimenting with providing drivers different options .
they may choose a device with or without gps .

pope francis call first cardinals in february
pope francis in san erect new cardinals of the catholic church for the first term of his service on february 22 , as the vatican announced thursday .
the cardinals are the senior clergy in the catholic church after the pope , and they elect popes , so that francis will appoint its first group of people who will ultimately be involved in the selection of his successor .
currently there are 201 cardinal .
however , after reaching the cardinal the age of 80 he can no longer participate in the election of pope - is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot; cardinal electors &quot; .
announcing the news , the vatican spokesman father federico lombardi said that before the ceremony elevation to the rank meeting will be held all current cardinals known as a consistory .
&quot; dad , francis decided to inform its decision to convene a consistory in february in order to facilitate planning meetings with other cardinals from around the world , &quot; - said lombardi .
jack valero organization &quot; catholic vote , &quot; said that by february the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline .
he said that dad usually calls cardinals as long as necessary to bring the number of new cardinal electors to 120 , as well as the cardinals over the age of 80 years as he wants .
consistory next year will be very important , because it will be the first since the election of francis in march of this year , according to valero .
at the moment , there is a kind bias in favor of europe , and especially in favor of italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance , &quot; - he said .
in south america , home to forty percent of catholics , but they represented an insignificant number of cardinals .
it also will be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the council of cardinals francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking for ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope decided all by yourself .
&quot; now francis chose eight cardinals that they helped him , &quot; - said valero .
he said that &quot; it is possible &quot; that francis will appeal to the cardinals for advice .
but we have not been in this situation before - all this for us for the first time .
valero said that the pope usually erected office of cardinal bishops of large parishes , but francis &apos; full of surprises - so we do not know who he would call . &quot;

tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the london bubble bursts
treasury performed a preliminary assessment of measures to tax on capital gains , but awaits a final decision from mr osborne , who in the 2012 budget introduced a state duty rate of 7 % for homes costing more than £ 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in partnership , rather than as individuals .
currently stamp duty on residential property in the areas of westminster , kensington and chelsea , which amounted to 708 million pounds in 2012 / 13 fiscal year already exceeds the total of northern ireland , wales , scotland , north-east , north-west , yorkshire and the humber together taken .
mr cook said : &quot; after the increase the state tax on expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against evasion is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued , regardless of the impact of outdated municipal tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move could lead to the fact that some foreign investors are reluctant to buy property in london or its current owners do not want to sell it , &quot; - he added .
the cost of prime real estate - the top 5-10 % of the housing market at a price - in the affluent southwest london zone that extends from fulham to wimbledon , soared by a record 11.8 % in the past year .
according to research company savills , prices in central london continued to show steady growth of 5.6 % year on year , but they eclipsed actively developing &quot; domestic market &quot; with a spike in the south-west , the north ( 7.4 % ) and east ( 6.5 % ) of the city .
the next meeting of the association of mechanical engineers tyumen region held on the basis of yalutorovsk automobile plant .
the event was a presentation of a new line for the production of electric steel pipes .
as the commercial director denis gribanov in 2011 with the advent of the new owner of marketing research to study the market for steel structures in the tyumen region .
it turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tonnes of electric tubes per month .
then it was decided to change the profile of the plant and the installation of its equipment to produce them .
already this year shipped more than 7,000 tons of output .
investment in plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles - said denis gribanov .
in october launched a new standard that allows you to increase the range .
the plant produces as a small profile of the pipe , which is used to heat individual economy , small forms of construction and furniture industries , and large - for the construction industry .
plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons per year , which represents about 10 percent of its consumption in the tyumen region .
despite the transition to another activity , the number of employees in the enterprise has not declined - now it is 157 people , with plans to purchase new equipment - increase staff more than 50 workers .
the enterprise is personnel training and the necessary experts chosen from the existing ones .
in the future , it is planned to introduce a new slitting steel up to five millimeters , which will reduce the cost of production , as well as another camp at a speed pipe production to 47 meters per minute .
by the end of 2014 the company going to master production of pipes , which are used in housing and communal services .
the company &apos;s management sets the task to close to 70 percent of the needs of the tyumen region in this production .
deputy director of investment policy leonid ostroumov , referring to the production manager , advised to pay more attention to the modernization of engineering enterprises .
this is the aim and forms of government support of industry , which include the compensation of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease .
in the current year for this purpose is provided to allocate 150 million rubles , two-thirds of this amount has already been spent .
last commission , which will consider contracts subsidy accepts documents from business until november 15 .
in addition , the budget shall be reimbursed the cost of the participation of local producers in international fairs .
next year budget provided funds amounting to 150 million rubles , which can be used to compensate for the lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment .
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs , 3 million - on energy efficiency programs .
reduced to 72 million rubles funds for compensation ordered and paid for the equipment produced in the south of the tyumen region for oil and gas industry .
according to leonid ostroumova in perspective , this form of support will cease , since its introduction was motivated compensation tax on mining that oil companies paid to the regional budget .
at the moment they do not become direct subsidies and expenditure commitments in the region .
with this in mind , the regional government gives priority to direct support to industry , rather than funding them through the oil industry .
assistance budget will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace .
many business leaders have expressed concern about the prevailing situation in the relations with the oil .
subsidy for the equipment they purchased is a competitive advantage of industry south of the tyumen region , and its abolition would be difficult to compete with the costs of central russia , where cheaper labor .
in addition , uncertainty regarding the succession of the new owner of tnk-bp - the company &quot; rosneft &quot; , which does not yet place their orders for the tyumen enterprises .
agreement on the implementation of the uvat expires in 2013 , and the application for its renewal is not received .
currently , the area south of the enterprise that specialize in equipment for oil and gas sector can not develop a portfolio of orders for the next year .
it remains an open question whether taxes will go from the extracted oil in uvat region &apos;s budget or they will be paid to the registered owner of the new fields .

also among the dead , as it is said in a statement , were army defector in 2202 and about 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
according to un estimates of 25 july , 100,000 were killed in the conflict since march 2011 .
since then , this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country .
assad &apos;s troops fought in a few weeks safir insurgents , many of whom are associated with al-qaeda groups .
center said on thursday there were casualties on both sides , but did not result in specific data .
the fighting underlined the danger faced by inspectors of the chemical weapons tight deadlines spurred his mission to rid syria of toxic arsenal , in the midst of the ongoing civil war .
in a statement , the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , said that her team was &quot; now satisfied that she checked and saw all declared syria destroyed critical means of production and equipment for mixing / filling . &quot;
she added that &quot; no additional inspection activities not currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspectors stated that they have completed the first round of inspection , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared damascus .
they were not able to visit two places for security reasons , said the inspectors .
on thursday , the opcw said that both places were , according to the syrian , &quot; ... and abandoned chemical weapons program items that are in them , have been moved to other places stated that were tested . &quot;
unable to immediately find out if the object was in safir one of two places that opcw inspectors were unable to visit .
syria submitted a plan of complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the executive committee of the opcw .
&quot; i salute the courage and bravery that you all showed in performing the most complex missions ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; - said general director of the monitoring group ahmet Üzümcü a commentary published by the opcw .

message : obama campaign considered an exception in favor of biden hillary clinton
according to the new york times , closest advisors of president barack obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing vice president joe biden , hillary clinton &apos;s candidacy in the electoral list in 2012 .
this discovery - the brightest of all the expected sensation of mark halperin and john haylemanna campaign 2012 &quot; the stakes are doubled : the game has changed in 2012 . &quot;
edition of the times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on thursday evening that the next presidential aides conducted &quot; extensive research in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011 , &quot; to assess whether the exclusion biden help raise fading hopes for re-election obama .
according to the times political columnist jonathan martin , the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of senior officials of election headquarters and the white house , namely , the former head of the white house bill daley , to assess what effect will vote on the appointment of former secretary of state clinton &apos;s vice-president .
possible replacement was a secret , carefully guarded in the chicago campaign headquarters and in the oval office .
only six of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including daly , former head of the obama campaign jim messina and former senior white house adviser david axelrod and david plouffe - knew that the replacement is considered .
the book &quot; the stakes are doubled &quot; asserts that daley was the initiator attempts to replace biden , despite their &quot; close personal relationship &quot; , but eventually abandoned this step , when their data showed that the addition of clinton &apos;s electoral list is not &quot; significantly improve the chances of obama . &quot;
in an interview with martin daly confirmed that the administration is really considered the possibility of replacing biden clinton .
&quot; i actively advocated the consideration of a variety of things , and it was one of them , &quot; - said the daily newspaper .
you must remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape , so we thought , &apos; oh my god , what shall we do ? &quot;
although daley described the study as &quot; a necessary check , &quot; martin told the representative of cnn &apos;s anderson cooper that the campaign headquarters of a lot invested in the study of this step will bring dividends on the ballot .
&quot; campaign headquarters do not spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups , if they do not see anything seriously , &quot; - said martin playing ak 360 .
it is unclear , however , whether obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacing .
martin told cnn , he asked daley if he knew his then boss about a possible reshuffle .
although daley and said he does not think that the president was &quot; aware &quot; of a possible replacement , former chief of staff acknowledged that &quot; perhaps &quot; , obama knew .
martin added that the &quot; stakes are doubled &quot; does not give a clear answer to the question whether the results reached political sensing section to obama .
cooper asked martin if he was serious believes that obama did not know about the study opportunities biden exclude from the ballot .
&quot; maybe &quot; , - said martin .

legislative bans forced russians to drink less beer
the russian brewers bad mood .
according to their estimates , the consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain the same , and it is in the best case .
although business was initially expected an increase .
after this year develops for them failed : sales fell 7 percent .
all this has told the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country , the chairman of the union of russian brewers isaac sheps iii annual conference on adam smith &quot; fmcg in russia &quot; , which has just ended in moscow .
she discussed the state regulation of the market .
from 2008 to 2012 the russian beer market has declined by 18 percent , as in recent years there has been a substantial increase regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a beverage with low alcohol content - told listeners sheps .
in any country of the world there is no such hard limit of the beer market , unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical prohibitions that supposedly justified struggle with alcohol abuse .
brewer lamented that many legislative restrictions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse , do not have much impact , nevertheless constantly bring new initiatives .
painful for all beer producers hit introduced this year to sell alcohol prohibition in the stalls .
&quot; we will have lost 35,000 customers , &quot; - said isaac sheps .
the next year at the brewers two predictions .
optimistic - he was talking about sheps : sale of beer remain the same .
pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent .
to keep their profits , businessmen forced to withdraw from classes , designed for the mass market , in a class of &quot; premium &quot; : beer will be smaller , but it will cost more .
meanwhile , the radical implications of the decline in sales with a small amount of alcohol is not visible yet .
&quot; according to my observations , the level of alcoholism remains roughly at the same level - said narcologist alex sotnikov .
however , increased the proportion of patients who use surrogates of spirits , as well as those who are &quot; hooked &quot; on alcohol-based tonics like &quot; jaguar &quot; , whereas ten years ago it was dominated by the &quot; beer &quot; alcoholism .
what will tpu construction in moscow
every year the city authorities promise to build more transport hubs ( tpu ) .
2020 is planned to put into operation 255 tpu .
what actually turns into a project understood our correspondent .
a couple of months ago in the metro &quot; smolensk &quot; arbat-pokrovskaya line originated construction fence .
the inscription reads that goes arrangement transport hub .
it was all very strange , because next to the &quot; smolensk &quot; no ground transportation stops and therefore can not transfer to him .
to get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the garden ring , one must overcome the order of 130 meters , including land crossing karmanitskiy alley .
now &quot; smolensk &quot; almost all finished .
faded flower stall dismantled stand for newspapers and asphalt paving stones in front replaced .
that &apos;s the whole crossing .
transport interchange nodes are planar and capital , - explained in the press service of the moscow department of transport .
tpu capital unavailable .
a planar involve the construction of parking lots , shopping facilities conclusion that hinder the movement of passengers , the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping .
actually , plane tpu not even engaged transporters and professional blagoustroiteli overhaul of the department of moscow .
transport hub - it is not necessarily a complex structure - explains the director of the institute of economics and transport policy higher school of economics mikhail blinkin .
sometimes it is a roof over your head and placards announcing the arrival time of transport .
for example , at the station &quot; jasenevo &quot; recently opened completely full plane interchange node .
let no shelters , but with bike parking placard and pointing when the bus will come .
but in pursuit of a record number of officials in the tpu everything popadja .
back in 2011 the mayor &apos;s office had planned to build at all about all the node 151 , 59 of them with capital projects .
now plans to appear in 2020 already 255 tpu .
hundred and fifty of them promise to pass more this year .
although the city has a program for the development of tpu , not designated any qualitative criteria , - says alexander morozov , co-chair of the &quot; city and transport . &quot;
report on the number of objects , but the quality of transplants in each of them often worsens .
criteria , according to experts , should be two : first - time reduction transplant , and secondly - convenience .
first of all , the opportunity to change the mode of transport , without going under the rain .
in moscow , the regeneration tpu sometimes goes exactly the opposite .
a striking example of the metro &quot; enea &quot; .
earlier shuttle buses from the yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the oce .
now they stop moved to the opposite side of the street yaroslavl cosmonauts .
farther from the subway , much farther from the monorail , but closer to homes .
services that residents did not want the bus station and complained about the windows in all possible instances .
with capital tpu in moscow at once is not specified .
the first of them began to build five years ago at the station &quot; glider &quot; .
the project was intended to be a model .
and really get a sample of how interchange node , farmed out to investors , turns into a banal shopping center .
no , there is a bus platforms , canopy , not to go on the subway in the rain , and three floors of parking .
however , khimki trolleybuses number 202 and number 203 in moscow tpu place not given principle .
others pushed them as far away from the metro .
but more space under the trade remains .
only one clothing store 32 , and in general have almost everything - from pet to dealership .
well , in fact , if someone from the bus passengers need to buy a new car in the driveway ?
we when building major tpu somehow always turns mall .
recently , the situation has reached its logical conclusion , when part of the car park have decided to give a market .
now on the third floor of tpu &quot; glider &quot; marked on the floor of parking spaces is a brisk trade .
vegetables , spices , chinese jeans , speech and non-russian guards , glancing angrily at our photographer .
interchange node finally turned into a bazaar .
the fact that earlier in the metro &quot; glider &quot; was a market , but it was demolished .
and in the prefecture and regretted traders allowed to intercept parking transportation hub .
anyway because of the high prices there is always empty .
the most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place a new plane ... tpu .
such is the reshuffle .
at metro &quot; kaluga &quot; approach distance from the lobby to the metro bus is 50 meters , - says alexander morozov .
after the construction of the shopping center , allegedly tpu distance increased to 170 meters .
to get on the bus , you must go through the entire mall .
after 22 hours , when it is closed , we have to get it in the open .
however , construction on the &quot; planar &quot; and &quot; kaluga &quot; soon seem flowers .
in mid-september of urban planning and land commission approved the mayor &apos;s office and planning solutions for the first eight capital tpu .
four of them will be 25-storey , except for two or three storeys underground .
the main monster grow at the station &quot; tushino &quot; , it will be 418.7 thousand square meters. square meters .
representatives of the directorate of railway stations railways responsible for the construction of tpu in the metro , has told reporters in future high-rise buildings will house shops , hotels and apartments .
with officials claim that stacked parking will take a third to half of the area .
take for example the &quot; folk &quot; garages .
say , a garage for 258 parking spaces , which recently built at the international street , has an area of ​ ​ 8015 square meters. meters .
so , parking space for 2,6 thousand cars in &quot; petrovsky-razumovsky &quot; will need about 80 000 &quot; squares &quot; .
less than a third of that colossus that there are going to build .
let one or two floors will be used for all sorts of platforms for buses .
remains of at least 150,000 square meters. feet of commercial real estate .
and this , for a moment , almost two gum .
if capital tpu at stations and railway station building , the rest of the site will develop metropolitenovtsy .
they also promised that there will be many &quot; objects functional purpose &quot; , including hotels , offices and even gyms .
by the way , in the department of property of moscow recently told reporters that drafting a resolution under which investors will be able to apply for a plot for tpu to officials directly .
without tenders .
because , they say , that the transport issues for the city - a priority .
perfect tpu - this , for example , the station &quot; harvard &quot; in boston or &quot; spadayna &quot; in toronto , - said alexander morozov .
there trolleybuses and trams go underground to the subway level and approach distance from subway car to the tram is just 50 meters without going outside .
around any extra trade .
but moscow officials rush to extremes .
either nothing will build or too otgrohat 25 floors with offices and apartments .

after the first flight of a prototype aircraft , which took place about six months ago , he flew only three more times , which raises questions about whether testing stage on schedule .
the results fell short of forecasts , and led to a drop in shares of more than 8 per cent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , national bank financial analyst , snizil on thursday svou mark with &quot; above srednerynočnogo &quot; to &quot; srednerynočnogo &quot; out-of belief , what height restricted shares in the next quarter or two .
&quot; although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable , we are certainly disappointed profit indicators of the transport department , &quot; - said doerksen in the review of the stock market .
we believe that bombardier receives new orders for cseries as we continue the flight test program .
nevertheless , in the coming months will not be announced new orders , we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program .
bombardier company hopes that the cseries aircraft family will allow her to win a seat in the lower end of the market , which is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first prototype aircraft was delivered in march and for the first time flew in september after months of delay .
however , firm orders for the cseries is not yet too much - 177 , because potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify the statements of fuel efficiency and potential profitability of a new liner .
total there are now 403 and the agreement with 15 customers and operators .
ceo pierre beaudoin was confident that bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders at the time when the first plane to be launched into commercial operation .
on thursday , the leaders also assured analysts and the media , that the program is progressing according to plan .
&quot; mock the aircraft to remain on the ground longer than expected , &quot; - said beaudoin during the conference call , adding that the downtime of the aircraft were scheduled ground test , and software updates .
all manufacturers are planning to test in different ways .
we decided to spend the first flight and take a break for an update , so we did .
this will occur throughout the flight test program .
the second of five test specimens shall make a flight in the coming weeks and the rest will soon follow , as reported by the company .
yet analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating aircraft cseries 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier company stated that it assesses the duration of commissioning and provide new information in the next few months .
&quot; this slow pace of flight tests - although , apparently , and corresponds to the internal graphics bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; - said doerksen .
in the third quarter ended sept . 30 , net income fell to $ bombardier 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , last year .
adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents .
gross profit declined slightly - from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion
analysts were expecting earnings of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that he put 45 aircraft during the quarter , a decrease from the previous year - 57 .
total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft .
backlog aerospace division totaled $ 32.9 billion at september 30 , unchanged from december 31 .
&quot; in the aerospace field results in line with our objectives , but a small amount of incoming orders and the general market conditions become unpleasant factor , &quot; - said beaudoin .
gross profit for the aerospace direction fell to 13 percent - up to $ 2 billion
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest manufacturer of trains , said gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent - up to $ 2.1 billion
backlog in the transport division totaled $ 32.6 billion as of september 30 , which is slightly higher than on december 31 .
income on transport division problems have adversely affected the performance of several large contracts .
management stated that the fourth quarter will be presented a new development plan .
shares of bombardier , which also announced that chief financial officer patrick pichette google inc. will join the board of directors , fell by 8.5 per cent - to c $ 4.83 in trading thursday in the middle .

two ymca employee charged with sex crimes before the charges against jonathan lord , became known as the royal commission
two employees ymca nsw were accused of sexually assaulting children to press charges in 2011 against the employee institution childcare karingbahe jonathan lord , told the royal commission on child sexual abuse .
but in the opening statement , the commission stated that it &quot; never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its own organization . &quot;
ceo philip hare asked about one case where an employee ymca was charged with offenses relating to child pornography , and on another occasion , when the gym instructor at ymca caringbah hall was convicted of sexual offenses against children , under his supervision , in 1991 year .
mr. hare said gail furness , counsel assisting the commission that he knew about the first case , but did not know about the second .
he acknowledged that the ymca in his opening speech for the commission also made ​ ​ a mistake , claiming that they were &quot; external audits ymca , acknowledges that ymca is at the forefront to ensure the safety of children . &quot;
commission submitted the evidence suggests that the ymca was notified that it had received a second from the end of the four possible ratings on the results of quality audit performed by the department of education and communities in august this year .
mr. hare , who joined the ymca , when he was 21 years old , admitted that he and the downstream guide made ​ ​ a mistake by hiring the lord , and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the personnel of their obligations relating to allegations of violations of children &apos;s security policy .
earlier this year the lord was convicted of sexual offenses against 12 boys within two years of his work in ymca .
he was jailed for at least six years .
but mr. hare rejected the notion that corporate ethics prevented ymca employees to report violations of the lord in the area of ​ ​ child safety .
employees testified that they observed violations , including what the lord was alone with children , personally took care of them , planted them on his lap , said he likes one of them and let them play with your cellphone .
daniel okvell , which was led by the lord and asked him to teach her the protection of children , because she was concerned about his behavior , testified that she found jackie barnato , manager of the child custody branch ymca in karingbahe , who was head of the lord , &quot; a very frightening and often inaccessible . &quot;
the executive director said that he does not accept the explanation of employees that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors .
rather , he said , their friendship with the lord takes them from thinking about the need to report it .
mr. hare said he had submitted to the board ymca nsw its view that the lesson for the organization of the &quot; incident with jonathan lord &quot; not &quot; regard to the provision of information &quot; on the part of employees , and the board agreed with him .
mr. hare said that the decision to get employees to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the accusations were made ​ ​ by ceo of ymca child custody liam wheatley .
he said that it was intended to prevent the deterioration of evidence , but the &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented this solution .
ymca of new south wales was not safe for children organization while working in her jonathan lord in the period 2009-2011 , told the commission expert on child molestation professor stephen smallbone of griffith university .
he said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , selection , instructing , training of personnel and monitoring them .
hearing has been adjourned until 20 december .
a screen adaptation of the novel by guillaume nickle denis diderot boasts an exceptional setting and historical details , but it is also difficult to read than it should be .
the film , which takes place in france of the 1760s , tells the grim story of suzanne , a young aristocrat , sent to the monastery of his family .
when she starts to rebel , she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of sadistic-prioress and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others .
the film never descends to vulgarity or sensation - and that &apos;s the problem .
because of its serious solemnity narrative risks becoming like sackcloth and test for the audience .
