anger due to sentence the organizers of the terrorist attack in bali
staying alive and the relatives of 202 dead as a result of the explosion of the bomb angrily reacted to a sentence in bali in 2002 , also declared taken out to the last of the conspirers which appeared before the court , that umar patek should be shot .
patek which has spent almost 10 years in the runs as one of the people in southeast asia most being sought was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment behind his role in the creation of the explosives used during the terrorist attack yesterday .
he can be liberated in 15 years if the uslovno-dosrochnoe liberation will receive .
the 45-year-old defendant was declared guilty of the slaughters as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district kuta in the course of which 202 people died , including 88 australians , and the dozens have still been wounded .
it was also recognized by the culprit on the series of the other accusations connected to terrorism , among them in the wave of the explosions of the churches on the whole indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
the public prosecutors demanded the lifelong period although they could insist that the person called by the « shot firer » for his reputation of the skilled worker on the manufacturing of the explosives should be sentenced to a capital punishment .
this decision redoubled the unhealthy memories of the mother of perta dzhun kortin who lost her 39-year-old daughters-twin dzheijn i dzhenni in the terrorist attack carried out by patekom and his accomplices almost ten years ago .
hardly holding back its tears , she said that patek must have been sentenced to a capital punishment .
« i really think that it has to follow on other guys &apos; stops .
it has to appear before a rasstreljnoij team said mrs kortin aap .
— i have to live while knowing every day that i will not have grandchildren any more and i will not see my daughters .
the club of « the sari » was destroyed after the massive explosive put into the van which was parked from the outside immediately after 11 of the evening of october 12 , 2002 was set in the action .
piter xjyuz was in the bar « pehddi » 20 seconds in total where the condemned man-terrorist blew up the rucksack filled by the explosive formerly .
after this terrorist attack it fell for a month into whom and three times « died » being connected to the life support system .
g-n xjyuz said , that patek has to share fate three other members of the terrorist cell « dzhemaa islamiya » , of the responsible one for the bloody massacre , — amrozi , muxlasa and the imam samudry who were executed four years ago .
really , this guy is deserving the capital punishment most a lot .
there are no reasons to save his life life to be saved to him , of course .
to receive 20 years after 202 people killed and wounded hundreds is not so much .
patek is last of the participants of the terrorist attack in bali , appearing before the court .
it was hiding into the flow of almost ten years , but finally was detained in january 2011 , in the pakistani town abbottabad , where the american troops killed the former leader « of al-qaeda » usamu ben ladena less the four months later .
in the course of court investigation the agent of the fbi showed that the present secret services were examining : patek was in pakistan in order to meet with ben ladenom in the attempt the connections between the terrorist groups of southeast asia and « al-qaeda » to be restored .
« he did not give up itself said mrs kortin .
up to the recent time he was not at all sorry for that , how much sorrow it caused to other people .
the sentence is pronounced on the threshold with the 10th anniversary of terrorist attack which will be celebrated later in this year in bali and australia .
« many tears will be in this year » , is saying mrs kortin .
patek can still appeal against his sentence .

the power engineers dnepropetrovqiny began the unique program of rescue ... the nests of the storks
into antiquity , in order to train to the yard of the storks , the peasants were installing the wheel from the wooden handcart on the high pole , and well it was held up by the heavy nest .
they are not standing such special supports up for a long time already , therefore the storks chose the poles of the lines of power transmission - the braided branches are leaning against the cables , thanks to that the aistinyij house is reliably .
the grandmother anya directly by whose house in the village of ivanovka petrikovskogo of the district twenty years aistinaya family has already lived started noting how the nest settles , despite all efforts of his inhabitants .
the birds are putting new vetochki from above , and the lower layer has already settled among the send-offs , will collapse any moment .
it is final , family of the storks which nested near the town house every year , took and suckled three to four chicks in the summer is pitiful , however , it to remain without light is not desirable .
as soon as the birds flew away into the warm edges , the grandmother anya called in carichanskiij rehs who a support belongs to .
i / you / she did even not expect that there they will react so fast either .
after our specialists came in ivanovku , they were surprised that , in general still , the nest is maintained : the technical director dtehk &quot; dneprooblehnergo &quot; sergei berezovsky said .
on the cables which , in essence , turned up the corrosion has already inside the nest which weighs 150 - 200 kilograms begun .
every time the birds could die of electric class .
what is more the local inhabitants risked remaining without a light due to the damage of send-offs .
therefore the linemen began the operation on the rescue of the nest , and already not for the first time in our practice .
scientists-ornithologist from the national dnepropetrovsk university helped who worked the scheme of the transfer of the nest out .
after all they conducted the trainings for the co-workers of the district nets .
the well known dnepropetrovsk ornithologist alexander ponomarenko has advised power engineers on all the stages of the reconstruction of the nests .
for beginning they calculated that in the field in the emergency state more than 50 aistinyx &quot; apartments &quot; are located .
the special metallic platforms which are reminiscent of a funnel were cooked for their reconstruction .
they braided the basis with the ivovymi branches , and then they carried the old nest there .
you have to put the old branches in it according to the experts , sufficiently as basis , that the birds recognized the nest and they returned .
already then the storks themselves will be finishing will build their dwelling .
in the village of peschanka novomoskovskogo of the district the first nest was reconstructed a month ago .
next to the electrosupport put the new reinforced concrete pole and they put the platform with the nest old , had settled already in it
the whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand grivnas .
and the other day the same new home took place in the village of ivanovka petrikovskogo of the district on the town house of the grandmother ani .
here they secured the platform in the former place , lifted up only above the send-offs .
the ornithologists are convinced , what will not note the careful , conservative birds even with the spring , that their &quot; apartment &quot; was exposed to the complete overhaul .
until the turn of the year the same reconstruction expects another four nests in pokrovskom also carichanskom the districts dnepropetrovqiny .
by the way , one have saved the rare birds yet , the other ones kill them ruthlessly .
the other day a sad information flew around the whole field - in the village of ustj-kamenka apostolovskogo of the district , per day the openings of the hunting for the pheasants , the poachers for the sake of entertainment shot lebedinuyu family which lived on the local pond .
the noble birds were not afraid of the people at all - their local inhabitants were feeding and they were not offending .
when the villagers ran to the pond after hearing the shots , four attractive young men-swan have already lain dead on water .
now the co-workers of the apostolovskogo district department of the police are clearing up who shot at the birds brought in the red book .

the lawyer was afraid that his secret narcotic dependence will be uncovered
liverpuljskim was sentenced to three years of the imprisonment by the royal court .
the prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about the big police investigation because that was afraid of exposure with its secret of the narcotic dependence the prison was put into for three years .
42-letniij bawarat ditta submitted to criminal authority nile skarboro secret information about the investigation into his activity on the illegal reverse side of the drugs after i / you / he was endangered due to his kokainovoij dependence .
the lawyer receiving the nickname baw and called among the criminals by « the steep lawyer » was arrested with himself at home for skarboro which it presented earlier in the court connected to the drugs in 2011 after the police operation on shadowing .
the officers noted , as 32-letniij skarboro three packets with cocaine left near the house of the lawyer in the town blehkbern of lancaster county , that has been with the co-workers on the supper of the jurists &apos; association yet .
the consequence uncovered that ditta regularly used the drug of the class a , after that as tests they showed the traces of cocaine in his hair , on his pocket-book and on the credit cards .
for eight months from january until august 2011 , he has tried unlawfully to receive the information about the arrests of two people on task for skarboro , as well as one of his accomplices .
all were four suspects at that time under the observation police within the framework of the large-scale investigation into the activity of criminal organization for market of heroin and cocaine in lancaster , cambria , mersisaijde , berkwire and western yorkshire .
they and another 32 people were later a million are concluded into the prison after the police withdrew in the course of the series the raids heroin and cocaine on the amount £ 1,5 as well as more £ 200 of thousands is available .
42-letniij ditta submitted the information to the criminals due to fear , that his kokainovaya dependence will be uncovered .
today in liverpuljskom the royal court ditta which is working in the legal company forbes solicitors being in blehkberne was covered shame after his acknowledgment of guilt in two cases of the intentional prevention the carrying out of the justice according to results three-week the court in the liverpuljskom court of the crown .
he confessed the storage of cocaine in one of the previous legal proceedings .
the jurist &apos;s exposure occurred after the police which is investigating the activity skarboro had clarified that he regularly talked to ditta on the telephone starting in february 2011 .
two detectives followed the suspect and discovered as it approached the house of ditta v blehkberne and put the drugs of the 60-percent cleanliness under the jurist &apos;s rubbish bins in the black glove for golf .
soon after the transfer for skarboro i / you / he repeatedly called up ditta which was on supper on the soccer stadium park ivud of team « blehkbern rovers » .
the jurist returned home behind the drugs ; between them nine conversations took place .
the court heard about ditta regularly using cocaine after the tests discovered the traces of the drug of the class a in his hair , purse and on his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested , however i / you / he rejected the use of cocaine , i / you / he said that i / you / he talked to the dealer to be suspicious of in so far as that was his client , and i / you / he was insisting on their conversation putting together an attorney &apos;s secret » .
during its delay ditta took its pocket-book and tried to take a few credit cards out , however they all were confiscated , the model of the hair was also taken from it
on the interrogation in police he said that together with the job with it also a domestic office was , and the clients got to his place in legal matters home .
however the court started knowing that after important arrests he called the biggest participants of illegal reverse side of the drugs whose row it introduced earlier in the court so that to say that the detectives know about them .
in accusatory speech ehnn said isle of wight : « if anybody also knows that one should not break the law this is the lawyer for criminal cases » .
g-n ditta is being accused of abuse of his condition of the lawyer for criminal cases in so far as it entered too close relationships with certain clients .
the contact which we are talking about narkotorgovec , and narkotorgovec that is equipping his own lawyer with the drugs are not simple .
some of his conversations , undoubtedly , will turn out lawful in so far as it was their lawyer .
however this crossed the borders of the normal relationships of the lawyer and the client to a considerable degree .
it hindered the police investigation so strongly as this is possible to allow these persons to continue its criminal activity .
g-n ditta did not honor his occupation , but i / you / he disgraced it
it became good friends too with certain clients , in particular skarboro , and allowed doubting its lack of interest .
i / you / he also declared ditta did not recognize the guilt : « if i was a corrupted lawyer who i am not , and would want to submit the information to mr skarboro , i would not have waited for 3 p.m. , i would have done this unzamedliteljno » .
but after session the older officer li xolsted declared from the police of lancaster : « g-n ditta turned of the lawyer of the in criminal cases into the criminal , as soon as i / you / he began to buy the drugs with the representatives organized crime » .
his passion to cocaine made it compromised hopelessly and vulnerable for the goals of the head participants of the criminal groupings who put it of obtaining the valuable information about the police investigations in charge .
the lawyers have to follow the highest standards of the professional ethic and to inculcate trust and confidence in society .
g-n ditta committed this trust and tried to take refuge in its occupation .
a subdivision of lancaster in especially dangerous organized crime which has already achieved the sentence in three cases of the storage of cocaine for it carried out the investigation in matter of mr ditta but now still also on prevention the carrying out of justice , showing our efforts to achieve the fair punishment for the criminals .
let this matter serve as a warning for the criminals about that that no one is out of the reach of the law .
we will find you and will draw to responsible judicial
he was condemned to 14 years by skarboro after the confession in deal with the aim of the delivery of heroin , cocaine and marihuana .
still 35 people who participated in an artifice were sentenced in the amount to 153 years for the crimes connected to the drugs .
on his site ditta an ideal partner for it organized the talk in the form of questions and answers in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer who introduces the clients with death sentence in america at supper — moxammed ali , and the motivation in work are disparity
the producers of the jet planes are feuding concerning the width of the seat when there are big orders on the kitty
between the leading producers of the planes the embittered dispute because of the width of the sittings of the tourist class on the distant flights flared up , setting the tone for the embittered confrontation on dubaijskoij the aircraft exhibition this month .
the dispute is rotating round the width of the sittings , being granted to the passengers on the daljnemagistraljnyx flights the economist-class under that whose interests are not always in the focal point of the airlines that the volume of the space picked out for them plays the key role in assertions about the effectiveness of the last planes , airbus sas being offered and boeing co .
airbus this week called to the introduction of the branch standard , which would provide for the width of the seat of at least the 18 inches ( 46 cm ) an economist is in the parlors-class , but her main american competitor boeing says that the airlines have to solve this .
the dispute is going when the producers of the planes are matching themselves in the sales of the always bigger versions of their daljnemagistraljnyx planes of two motors at that time , and on the measure on 17-21st november the potential records orders are being expected .
the arrangement is especially that to the back part of the plane , 9 or 10 people into row are really sitting — the central place in statements about the economic effectiveness of the new projects of « mini-aehrobusov » takes up .
boeing asserts that her renewed 777x will hold 406 people , based on the sittings in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width put in every row in 10 .
airbus is speaking , that the competing version her a350 will transport into the economist-the class of 350 people on the seats with a width of 18 inches put in 9 into row .
giants of aircraft construction often exchange blows to technical questions with the help of the advertisement in the professional press .
and now airbus is turning directly to public more than with 100 orders before aviawou in dubai , where 777x will become a leader as is being expected .
it showed recently what beginning of the new advertising war can be , after showing the financial experts the slide that describes three people in the restaurant , pressed against each other , under name « you would have agreed on this » ?
« boeing offers the daljnemagistraljnye flights on narrower seats than near the regional turboprop planes » , said the leader of the sales the airbus john lixi .
with the change of the ration of the nourishment the people are gathering weight , but the airplane seats did fundamentally not change .
among beginning the 1970th , when boeing 747 of wide hull assigned the standards of the modern distant trips , and the weight of the middle american man at the age from 40 to 49 years increased with the border of century of 10 percent , according to the data of the department of the health service of the usa .
the girth of the waist of the middle american man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches , according to the statistical data of the service of the health service of the usa .
airbus asserts that her competitor is keeping to the conception of the sittings of 1950 when the middle girth of the waist of those who recently they named « the jet public » has already been .
airbus says that i / you / she ordered the research which examines that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of the dream by 53 percent .
boeing is contesting the numbers airbus in sizes of the seats and says that it is not it to the producers worth to meddle in the decisions about that , as airlines to find balance among the tariffs and comforts
according to her statement , the researches show that the comfort of the parlor depends not only on the width of the seat .
« as a matter of fact everything boils down to the granting of choice and the opportunity to do what in their opinion they have to do for the achievement of success to the airlines » , said specialist boeing in the parlors kent kreijver .
they do not want , that we decided for them , that profit will bring to them .
they have still known their job better than anybody has .
for the passengers a question is on the sides in the increase of the space , but for the suppliers this becomes more and more the factor which can influence a profit .
during this dispute a race costs during the orders for the planes that are appraised at least at next decades of $ 700 billion at catalog prices : it is sufficient in order to change the relation of the american and european export .
as the reijter agency announced in july for the first time , the arrangement of the sittings is what is warming up the rivalry for battle among the newest jet planes .
both airbus and boeing are reporting the 20-percent rise in the profitability by one place in their last daljnemagistraljnyx models of two motors in comparison with the market leader in this segment , 365-местным boeing 777-300er .
the declared characteristics boeing are partially based on the comparison of the 10-local rows 777x to the original 9-local arrangement of the series of the constructive decision 777 .
the win in a specific cost price is coming down on the comparison to the 10-local arrangement which is used at present .
« the reason which makes boeing this is in that in order to press more places and to make more competitive its plane in comparison with our developments » , said kevin keniston , the head of the department of the comfort of passengers airbus is in europe .
on the other hand , the analysts say that the parlors with the full 10-local rows for the existing 777th are pointing that out , that many passengers prefer dense settling to be able to go on hand in hand with the lower tariffs .
« the seats were a width eighteen inches ideal for the passengers , but reality is such , that from commercial point of view the offering to airbus is stipulated by the threat on the side of the 777th model » , said the specialist in interior of mary kirbi parlor , the founder and editor runway girl network .
airbus and boeing are not delivering an armchair , but are offering the suppliers &apos; catalog which they can choose the airlines from .
the sellers of the jet planes traveling around peace are even transporting the roulettes with themselves in order to check the competing layouts .
raving about comfort , all the producers are also offering the planes with the very dense arrangement of the parlor for budgetary airlines and the regional flights .
airbus is offering a350 с 10-местными with equal rank , but says that she has still not been selling it .
up to the recent time airbus a necessity of the additional modifications of the parlors was emphasizing offering the wider places near passageway on several things from its planes .
without support another only producer of the big modern planes , as the experts are speaking , her appeal to new branch standard « scarcely will fly up » , but attention can divert the models 777x from the wave of the sales .

gebuza declared afp , french press agency , what mr dxlakama felt « like an unlucky fellow » on wednesday wanting to use « everything that was left behind from his forces in order to try to prove that it can impose his own decisions on the government » .
both frelimo and renamo are insisting on their wanting to avoid the war .
however the fears grew after message about mazanga reporting the rejection of renamo from the peace agreement of 1992 .
he informed financial times that frelimo meant the inobservance of the agreement by the party .
our goal is to return to the negotiations , but with the whole seriousness » , said mazanga .
the previous negotiations between the parties did the tension which a series of clashes strengthened in this year for the weakening little .
this two influential people ( gebuza i dxlakama ) , coming across , is « with their foreheads » said joseph xanlon , the lecturer of the open university and the expert on mozambique .
no one of them is a good negotiator and no one of them is ready not to make necessary concessions .
the party renamo which is trying to achieve the electoral reforms has already reported that she will boycott the municipal elections nominated for november .
the presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year .
some commentators interpreted this pressure as the attempt of the movement which grew weak to achieve the concessions and the financial bonuses from a government .
the share of placets comes down renamo since 1992 , while the new party is the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) , which is founded by the former member renamo as he is being expected it will improve his indexes on these elections .
g-n mazanga says that mr gebuza who has to leave post in the next year , after his second period will end wants to abolish democracy in the country .
« he does not want multipart democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want a peace because he does not want to abandon the president &apos;s post » said mazanga .
it is unclear what possibilities renamo possesses , however she has already carried out the destructive and precipitant attacks on the police stations and the cars are on the key highway that is leading from the north to the south .
the majority of skirmishes took place in the province sofala which is located in a little hundred kilometers north of maputo , but includes beijru — port , which mining companies , including rio tinto and vale , use in order to export coal .
in june rio stopped the use of railway roads to approximately a week after renamo had threatened by the attack on the railway .
mazanga was evasive when they asked him the question whether renamo will repeat this threat .
the party renamo wanted « to give advance notice to the international association of the things not being going on in mozambique not really well » , said mazanga .
instability strengthened dissatisfaction government , but corruption , the slow tempo of development and the people &apos;s abductions which became more frequent recently also upset many people , lima , chapter independent mediakompanii mediacoop , is speaking with fernando .
« the people think that the government and the president who also has to find the solution to these problems are bearing responsibility in the future of the country » he is saying .
omar sultuan , the participant of the demonstration , said that the people simply want stability .
« no one is upsetting neither renamo , nor frelimo , they simply want the renewal of the peace they want the free access to the roads » , he said .

an influence is for the ferrymen of the usa decrees will be to vary from an airline to airline and it will depend on the age of their aviaparka .
the ferrymen will have to prove that their planes possess resistance to radio interferences from the mobile devices , as well as to review aids , instructional materials , the norms on the carriage of the hand luggage and the instructions for the passengers .
« after the airline has checked and an interference immunity of its fleet has confirmed , can let the passengers use portable , the light electronic such as the map cases , the e-books and smartfony instruments , at just any height » , fau declared .
in the rare cases of the bad visibility the crew will give the passengers the instructions to turn off its devices during landing .
moreover , according to the recommendation the groups , the heavier devices should be put under the seats or in the top baggage compartments during take-off and landing .

the accuser , the royal lawyer andrew ehdis informed the court old-beijli what he received the newspaper news of the world doubtful news about that in may 2005 , that he is meeting klark with his « attractive special council » xannoij polbi .
the newspaper put the private detective glennu mulkeijru of forcing the vocal post office polbi in charge and awaited it near the house in order to take the interview , however , koulson also called her and left vocal messages : the court heard .
« the accusation considers what is mr koulson who now is editor notw it is not such a person who will be directly by somebody &apos;s house hoping to find somebody by surprise , it is a person who loves offering the people history in order to see , which they » will « say » : mr ehdis said .
he said that the newspaper news of the world used three methods of investigation into histories : the breaking in the telephones , the shadowing and opposition .
the editor is personally mixed up in the third .
evidently , he knows about the second , about the shadowing , he simply owes .
what about the first ?
does he know about the breaking in the telephones ?
he says that it is not no , we are speaking : « about , yes » !
the rumors about klarka novel attracted the attention of the editorial office news of the world for the first time when source sexually interested in mrs polbi is , said : do not waste the time , it with charles » .
the box with the vocal messages received from her telephone at least three times was confiscated from the home mulkeijra in august of 2006th .
the investigators also found the entries on the computer of the private detective in which miss polbi and her sister appeared like « projects » .
during the period , when it was under the shadowing , the grandmother and the grandfather of the mrs polbi were receiving the anonymous bells with the requests to provide the information about it mr ehdis said .
the at that time being head reporter of the non-villas terlbek and the former reporter james uehzerap checked the shadowing during the movements of the mrs polbi .

there is no &quot; brotherly circle &quot; grouping which they added lepsa to in the usa in the bases of the department of the interior of the interior
it does not appear in the data bases of the russian workers of the &quot; brotherly circle &quot; grouping which washington added the singer gregory lepsa to .
how did not note &quot; interfaksu &quot; in the law-enforcement agencies of the russian federation , after into some mass media the messages about gregory lepsa registration by the treasury department of the usa in the check lists on suspicion of accessories emerged to evraziijskomu criminal syndicate &quot; brotherly circle &quot; , the data bases were checked all , but such a grouping is discovered was .
the propagation of the present information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about &quot; the &quot; so-called russian mafia &quot; which supposedly is active abroad , they are counting in power structures .
&quot; even in a name itself is &apos; brotherly circle &apos; , there is a certain component of mystery , contains the allusion on the secret box .
all this &quot; really looks like a piar-action said an interlocutor of the agency .
the treasury department of the usa declared on 31st october about a registration into its check lists on suspicion into accessories for evraziijskomu criminal syndicate &quot; brotherly range &quot; of arthur badalyana , gregory lepsveridze , vadim lyalina , sergei moskalenko , jacob rybaljskogo and igor wlykova .
the persons brought in this list they are suspecting of connections with certain vladislav leontjevym and gafurom raximovym , which are considered influential members of criminal groups and are in the sankcionnyx copies of the usa from february 2012 .
according to american authorities , gregory leps is &quot; serving as a courier for the delivery of the money on behalf of leontjeva vladislav &quot; .
in gregory lepsa prodyuserskom center they refused to comment the accusations of the usa directed at the singer after naming them &quot; a delirium &quot; .
in 2011 the president of the usa barak obama took the &quot; brotherly circle &quot; syndicate by the number of &quot; the essential transnational criminal organized groupings &quot; and put the ministry of finance &quot; of undermining and prohibiting from their global criminal operations &quot; in charge .
the person &apos;s entry into the black lists of the american ministry of finance entails the blockage of his assets to the usa and ban on business contacts with it the persons that live in some staff
the scientists spilled light on that , as the movements of the dog &apos;s tail are connected to her mood .
the earlier researches showed that the content dogs are wagging the tail into the right hand side ( from the point of view of the dog ) while the worried dogs are waving with the tail primarily into left side .
but now the scientists are speaking , that the other representatives of the family can note the ones dog also to react to them these delicate distinctions in wagging by the tail .
professor dzhordzhio vallortigara , the neurobiologist from the trentskogo university , is speaking : « which they participate with the people of the left and right side of the brain differently in the formation of pobuditeleij which cause positive or negative emotions is well known » .
here we tried to look on this and near some other looks
he added that the right part of the brain is checking the left side of the body just as as with the person , at the dogs and conversely , also two hemispheres play different roles in emotions .
in order to know more about that , like the dogs wagging of other dogs &apos; tails react to the many-sided ones , the researchers observed behind the animals when they were watching the films about other dogs .
they measured the frequency of the palpitation of the animals and analyzed their behavior .
probably , we will understand already soon why their tails go to one side sometimes , and are sometimes into another
professor vallortigara said : « we showed to the dogs of the video with the dogs is either naturalistic versions or silhouette , that they could get rid of just any another deforming factor , and we manipulate the movement of the tail also to direct the tail to the left or to the right more » .
when the animals saw that the dog not expressing anything in the remaining one moved its tail to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that is wagging its tail ) they remained weakened absolutely .
but when they were noting , that the tail was tending primarily to the left ( again from the point of view of the dog that is wagging its tail ) , their palpitation became more frequent and they looked worried .
professor vallortigara said that he does not think that the dogs intentionally associated with each other with the help of these movements .
as a matter of fact he thinks that the dogs knew about what movements should worry them , and about what is not no from their experience
he is noting : « if a few meetings with other dogs are going on also often is connected wagging of their tail to one side « with a friendlier behavior , but the right hand side gives a less friendly behavior , the dog reacts according to this experience
the researchers say that these results can give the owners , the veterinarians and the ringmasters the deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal .
is an expert in the field of the behavior of the dogs the john brehdwou , the scientific invited co-worker is in the veterinary school bristoljskogo of university said , that this was not the first research for the that check , they really have the importance for the dogs of the left and right side .
last year the group of the scientists from lincoln &apos;s university discovered that the dogs are turning their heads to the left if they look on the aggressive dog , and to the right , if they look at the content dog .
and in another scientific work of victoria &apos;s university in canada he was announcing : « the dogs approached the dog robot more often , when wagging of her tail « went to the left , but not to the right , instead of becoming worried , the opposite behavior is with respect to an italian research » .
he said that distinctions could be due to that which the dogs did not perceive in different researches completely the animals in films or the dogs robot as the dogs .
a research of the that could be effective as the dogs react to the real dogs , he explained .
« while it exists sufficiently on different mammals the evidences of two lobes of cerebrum being used for some different goals many components still does not lie ahead to specify , also the dogs exception is said it
however , taking into consideration that facility from which their behavior can be registered probably , we will already soon understand why their tails go to one side sometimes , and are sometimes into another .
is the elite of europe ready to carry out the business with england ?
the campaign of business for britain was neglected in april with the obligation to call the representatives of business together and to determine what changes the founders of prosperity and the jobs of great britain want to see in relationships with the eu .
with this goal we ordered the biggest and fullest polling of british biznes-liderov after asking them to state their thoughts about great britain , business and the eu .
the company yougov questioned more than 1000 biznes-liderov presenting the wide section of business in great britain on the sizes , sectors and the regions .
the conclusions of polling will turn out to be suddenness for many people .
we clarified that that overwhelming the majority of the businesses at present is looking for the possibilities of the export behind the limits of europe paying a particular attention to the countries which are organizing a modernization and are growing , are like the countries of the eu at that time in a stagnation .
they want so that the government would give priority to new trade relations with such countries as china , india and brasilia but did not waste the time for the long and difficult process of the reform of the tangled institutes of the eu .
when they were asking them about their looks on concrete political questions , from the anti-monopolistic control before laws on the production , majority is business-they counted the leaders that the control of these key spheres should be returned to responsibility by vestminsteru .
attended common dissatisfaction a single market , while the representatives of business were declaring that the costs from the control outweigh the advantages from the discovery in the trade zone of europe from brussels now even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises agreed with this , traditional наиболее proevropeijski incited from all the companies .
last and most exponential is our polling of the leaders of business discovered , what overt majority wants , that great britain conducted the course on the change of the agreement also on the relationships with the eu based on a commerce , and not on policy .
this result which was observed among the businesses of all the sizes and biggest biznes-grupp shows what is drawing the business on « the important change » which will bring back a power to great britain back .
the rates are high — the achievement of the changes in agreement and more profitable conditions for great britain will provide the 16-percent shift in vote behind staying in the eu .
the prime minister does not have to have no doubts : this polling shows that the british business maintains his plan of the revision of the conditions of the membership of great britain in the eu .
it also shows that he is expecting the business , that it will lead the revision to the considerable shift in the current balance of the forces back in the direction of great britain .
the better conditions for british business are possible and are becoming always more necessary enters according to that , how evrozona on the path of the narrower economic and financial association .
priority has to be felt the jobs and the economic growth in great britain , and as they show the results of our polling for a business this means the strengthened concentration of the attention on commerce and the fundamental changes in the normative activity of brussels .

in siberia it is not it to be veganom worth : greenhouse tomato will not replace supchik
i / you / she cleared up why vegetarianism is not approaching for life in siberia correspondent ria of news .
the people who completely refused the products of the animal origin do not have to live in siberia .
it will not be possible here for them to carry the winter without losses for health , also no greenhouse tomatoes compensate for them , questioned think on the eve of a day was vegana the new-siberian nutritionists and the doctors .
to drink butter the liters
the strict vegetarianism when they are refusing not only meat and the fish , but also milk , honey , the eggs is becoming a stylish way of life .
however the nutritionist-doctors are convinced , which to keep to such strict norms in the nourishment as the minimum , in novosibirsk and the other towns of siberia is not useful for health .
the full refusal of the animal products is harmful .
the animal whites contain the indispensable amino acids , which it is really complicated to compensate for vegetable .
it is necessary to include the ration at least in milk or the eggs certainly &quot; , nutritionist marina bogaij is convinced .
it is citing the fish which contains indispensable fatty acid omega-3 as an example .
the vegetable oil , richest in it is flax .
&quot; in order to use it in the quantities that are necessary for the person , it is necessary to drink the liters &quot; ! - a nutritionist is speaking .
the physicians are convinced that the inhabitants of siberia should pay a particular attention to the ration in the winter .
vegetarianism is being put especially in this season under doubt .
with regard to our real facts the high demands are being made on the food
in order to not freeze , a greater calorie content is necessary .
&quot; if the person is limiting himself on the animal products , correspondingly , he is not getting enough of this calorie content &quot; , is saying a specialist .
doctor-nutritionist olga poznyak is agreeing with this .
she is adding , what is the imported vegetables and the fruits not exit .
it is better for the person to live primarily on the products which are raised in the region of living or there , where it was born .
the genetic code is incited on the better learning and overcooking of these products .
also the winter would like the people ogurchik not to gnaw , but hot supchika or still something slightly-filling &quot; , a doctor is explaining his position .
according to her statement , from that , that they can eat were vegany , different cereals are properly useful , the groats , the legume , local vegetables , the apples , are berries remaining into the winter , frozen .
but this , it is unambiguous , is insufficient for the full-fledged nourishment .
according to the doctor gastroenterologist claudia arifulinoij , with the siberians in the organisms the level of vitamins a sufficient only since the middle of august on the middle of september .
the full transition to the vegetarianism under our hard natural conditions when the temperature can change of 30 degrees in a day and in may the snow is is unsuitable .
energy , and this are necessary for the organism for life , above all , fat &quot; , is a physician is stating .
the doctors note that veganstvo is especially harmful for the children and the pregnant women .
the children are growing , they need building material , among them in the form of the amino acids .
but be keeping to vegetarianism , we give them defective .
the pregnant women are also needing the greater keeping of white , vitamins and trace elements in the menu .
&quot; veganki receives not enough of them &quot; , bogaij is convinced
arifulina is speaking , that the adult person is to choose free все &quot; , which &quot; , he wants &quot; anything , to &quot; play into those toys &quot; .
he has an organism which has already developed , a skeleton , organs .
but nevertheless the children have to live in a full-fledged way .
if the parents are depriving it of their some trace elements or the amino acids , choosing for it what he will eat , this simple the infringement of the rights the child .
&quot; you will not restore the shortage of some substances for the development of the brain , sight , the bones tomorrow already &quot; , she is saying .
all the questioned specialists-physician agree about opinion about the poor quality of vegetables being raised by the winter in the greenhouses and imported and fruits .
that , that they are bringing also raised to our place in the greenhouses , a smaller quantity of the trace elements that are necessary for us contains , like what ( raised ) in the open ground .
&quot; the quality of the products not that &quot; , bogaij is speaking .
arifulina also notes that the imported and greenhouse vegetables and the fruits are far from some ideal standards .
at times the producers &apos; wish to gather greater harvest causes damage to quality .
&quot; the apples are not becoming brown on the section , the cucumbers turn yellow fast and grow , the tomatoes are tasteless and unaromatic &quot; : a physician is listing examples adding that they are stuffed by the excessive quantity of fertilizers , most probably .
also they are becoming suppliers of not vitamins , but cellulose .
with this not concordant zavlaboratorieij of siberian physics-technical institute of agrarian problems , the candidate of seljxoz of the sciences vera petruk .
she says that on right approach and the observance of all the norms and demands in the greenhouses the raising of the full-fledged vegetables is possible .
of course , if they are trying to distill more from a square meter , will water also more often , also to overfeed plants the mineral fertilizers .
to example , when too many nitric fertilizers are , the tomatoes grow fast , they are big , but watery and unsweetened &quot; , she is explaining while adding that , first of all , a matter of quality depends conscience from the producer .
russia out of the struggle for pollution of the towns through the cars

as a rule , the talk was either about their reorganization and widening of highways or about the attempts to reduce the demand for automobile trips , the quantity of the cars and the time their uses .
widely the example of singapore where the hard quotation of the increase of the number of private cars is brought , and the right of their acquisition is being bought on the auctions is well known .
his price can exceed the price of the car itself by two to three times .
the european towns , including london , introduced the charge for the entry into the downtown .
in germany , for example in hamburg and stuttgart , they are bringing the so-called green zones , where the entry is allowed only the cars with certain ehkoklassom also using the fuel of quality ( including biofuel or the electric vehicles ) .
the agency of the environmental protection of beijing , for example , reconfirmed in 2012 &quot; the quinquennial plan of the pure air &quot; the total value about 250 billion yuans ( close to $ 40 billion ) .
as &quot; h &quot; said the director of the department of the control of transport soiling of municipal office of environmental protection of beijing li kunweng , the main aim of five-year plan is a reduction of the leading pollutants of air of 20-35 % by 2017 , a growth of the quantity not exceeding the private cars to level 6 million ( now 5.2 млн ) , as well as the increase by at most 5 % of the use of the fuel with regard to one means of transport .
according to the data of the agency , the road traffic is responsible in beijing for 22.5 % of a common air pollution now .
there are a restriction of the use of the automobile transport , as well as an introduction of additional taxes for the car owners among the main measures of the program .
apart from other , city measures &quot; green they include &quot; the five-year plans &quot; quickened in comparison with remaining the country the transition to evrostandarty the fuels , introduction local the systems of ehkostandartov and the markings of the cars and fuel , restriction to the entry of the cars into the inner city , ban on use the means of transport which became obsolete ( moreover the creation promotional financial the programs of the replacement old the cars on hybrid or the electric vehicles ) , the development of the electric means of transportation ( public among them and auxiliary the development of public transport ( the one high-speed among them ) .
the ban for all the private cars on movement also belongs to the automobile innovations of beijing within the fifth transport ring ( all in the capital of the people &apos;s republic of china them six ) one day per week ( the license plate of the means of transport contains the appropriate information ) , as well as the delivery of the registration marks for the cars are according to lottery ( for example , in 2011 , the first year of the action of lottery the common quantity of the permissions for the registration of the private cars in beijing was only the third from the quantity of 2010 ) .
according to the current state program &quot; environmental protection by 2012-2020 &quot; , the quantity of the towns with high and very high air pollution has to decrease to 128 ( in 2012 them was 138 ) .
in 2011 on &quot; the mobile sources &quot; 41 % of all the ejections of the soiling substances to the atmosphere of the towns fit , the data of the minprirody .
in moscow , for example , the industrial ones exceed the ejections from the cars ten times as much , and there is in st petersburg nine times as much .
in the russian federation they begin to be only thoughtful about the possibilities of the restrictive control of the cars in the streets of the towns yet .
the director of the institute is counting the economies of transport and transport policy vweh michael blinkin , that the administrative and fiscal measures directed towards the suppression of the demand for automobile trips are matter wittingly unpopular , they can be received by the society only on condition of their most complete universality .
in the event of moscow a unique problem connected to the structure of her vehicle fleet arises attend where the ones two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulating influences - the auxiliary and personal cars , as well as the cars of the &quot; privileged &quot; users whose total number is at least 200 000 ( about 5 % from the total number of the vehicle fleet of moscow ) .
the other day the urbanists prepared the research from the center ehkom in st petersburg where the balance of the city territories is being analyzed among the dwelling building , the area of the road surface and the quantity of the road traffic .
the researchers &apos; main withdrawals : the downtown is provided by the roads twice less being demanded , and the majority of the motorists that live in the center cars do not use every day , leaving them on for a long time on the parkings or simply in the streets .
as a result it is being offered to build not parkings , but the storehouses of the cars , not to enlarge , but to reduce the lane ( in order to the streets became friendlier for the pedestrians ) , as well as to limit a use and the allocation of the personal transport in the boundaries of the territory of the protection zone of historic center ( the common territory about 3212 hectares covering the row of the central districts the towns ) .
a tax maneuver which provides for the rise in of the loot of the mineral resources ( ndpi ) tax by mineral oil with the reduction of the export duties and the rise in the excise duties simultaneously will lead to podorozhaniyu of fuel .
according to the experts , they can bring these measures into the budget additional 619.3 billion rouble .

dr zhorzh bvelle is one of 10 protagonists cnn of 2013 .
you can vote for it or for any of other 10 protagonists so that it would become the hero of the year cnn .
this person will receive 250 000 $ for the continuation of his outstanding work .
for 21 zhorzh bvelle has seen , as it the father returned to life and he again fell into an unconscious state wandering about the hospitals which were not equipped properly so that to help it
dzhamef bvelle received the trauma in the car accident in 1981 close to yaounde , the capitals of cameroon .
at first with it the arm was only broken , but the infection which arose concerned the brain and it caused the hematoma which was reminiscent of herself until the end of life .
« there were no neurosurgeons in cameroon , said zhorzh bvelle .
if we had money , we would have removed it from cameroon .
instead of this bvelle i / you / he accompanied his father with years in the overfilled clinics and the hospitals receiving just any treatment which they could receive .
this is difficult , said bvelle .
— you can leave the house at 5 а.m. , run into the hospital in order to be the first but you already not the first .
there are really many patients .
several things can die due to that what they have to wait for .
the situation did strongly not change ever since the father bvelle passed away in 2002 .
according to the data of the world health organization , only one doctor of 5000 people is in cameroon .
for the comparison , the relation in the united states — one doctor per 413 people .
and even if the cameroonians could turn to the doctor , this would be many things of them not on the pocket .
two of five people in this country live behind a line bednosti , also hardly three quarters of the expenses for the health service in it are quotients .
« poverty is their only problem , said bvelle .
— also due to poverty they are not able to enjoy their life » .
seeing the sufferings of its father and very many his compatriots , bvelle preispolnilsya to resolution to do something with this .
last year dr zhorzh bvelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations .
it himself became a doctor and is working as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital of yaounde .
he also founded the non-profit organization ascovime , who is organizing the trips into the country side on the ones exit for the granting of the free medical care .
since 2008 it and his group of the volunteers have provided the aid hardly to 32 000 people .
almost every friday they are being filled into the vans also still before 30 people , they are tying medical accessories to the roofs and they are going on the cross-country in order to visit the villages which are needing a help .
luck has not always accompanied them .
they time and again had to push the cars across the rivers and the mud .
but when they are coming , they meet them as the true heroes : these are a holiday with songs and the dances and better rooms , what the local inhabitants can put forward only .
the free medical servicing is really cause of holiday in these villages , and bvelle is with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join a merriment .
the brigade begins to receive hundreds of the patients on the next morning .
« we receive 500 people on every trip » , said bvelle .
they are arriving from the whole neighborhood within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village , and they are coming on foot .
each of these clinics of the holiday grants diverse medical services .
many people are receiving a treatment from malaria , the tuberculosis , malnutrition , a diabetes , the parasites and the diseases which pass on sexual road .
the other ones can receive the crutches , the donated glasses or the free evidences about the birth — documents , necessary for the school , which simply can allow themselves many poor families .
the brigade conducts the simple operations under local anaesthesia in the evening .
the operations are being conducted in the school building , as a rule , the municipal administration or in the house ; after procedure the patients are walking up and are going to the postoperative zone , in order to vacate the place for the following person .
using the generator for the lighting of the operating and sanitary processing of the equipment , bvelle and it the volunteers are working until the early morning sundays .
this the back-breaking tempo , but celeustremlennostj of brigade normally help to support the village musicians .
« they beat the whole night into the drums » bvelle said « that we stayed awake and continued to work » .
on sunday the members of brigade are setting out back to the town , tired , but proud of its work .
this group which consists of the cameroonian doctors and the foreign students-physician has conducted 700 free operations in the last year , and they know that their help can have the huge importance for those who they help .
one person explained that the free operation which was received by it will allow on the treatment of the rupture him again to work .
this will change the future for me of also my family » , said a man .
in addition to these clinical techniques into the ones exit and the work in the hospital surgeon bvelle also works the nights in the private medical clinics around yaounde .
according to his statement , namely this second work guarantees 60 % of his financing to non-profit organization ; the remaining resources are covered at the expense of the private donations .
« i do even not know when he is sleeping » , said kehti o &apos;mehlli , the medical student of second course of the drekseljskogo university is in philadelphia , the volunteer is in a group bvelle .
it always either in the hospital , or he is trying to earn the money for an organization so that one would be able to continue these campaigns .
a possibility of practice which they would never have received from themselves at home is for the future doctors and the nurses as o &apos;mehlli coming from the usa and europe in order to join bvelle in the realization of his tasks , this .
« we had the opportunity to assist bvelle on the operations , where we helped to remove the spots of blood or to hold the instruments for the doctor » , said o &apos;mehlli .
being a sophomore-student , you would never have had such a possibility in america .
volunteer-students are normally paying themselves for their passage to cameroon often arriving with the donated medicines .
but in arrival in their yaounde the nourishment , bvelle is paying for the transport and the teaching
« it the hero , without a doubt » , o &apos;mehlli said .
he is giving his life of this organization , and his wish to help the people of cameroon endlessly .
for bvelle hardly constant capacity utilization is not work the difficult test .
to help the other ones to live for happy life , to fulfill a promise that was made for its father is the that it is bringing him a big joy .
« i am so happy , after i am doing this work , said bvelle .
— also i think about my father .
i hope , he sees what i am doing .
i am doing this that the people laughed in order to diminish their pain .
drop by the site ascovime and watch how you can help out .
behind &quot; the russian mafia &quot; in the usa the new name - &quot; brotherly circle &quot; became established in a final way
this week the blacklist of &quot; the russian mafia &quot; in america was replenished with new names and four companies .
the treasury department of the usa introduced three representatives of russia , two citizens of uzbekistan and the israeli into &quot; a brotherly circle &quot; .
a well known singer gregory leps who the usa is suspecting of the transportation of the money for members of grouping turned out one of the russians .
all after all in the blacklist of the usa of 22 the person , the people that are involved in &quot; brotherly circle &quot; , and six affilirovannyx with it of organizations .
nevertheless many experts are expressing the doubts about such an organization realizably existing .
&quot; statement &quot; is &quot; about bratsk circle &apos; is resembling more the attempt to unite the isolated criminal groupings &quot; , i / you / he declared earlier the expert in organized crime and the professor of the university of new york mark galeotti .
in his opinion , &quot; the brotherly circle &quot; is reflecting the popular perception of &quot; the russian mafia &quot; .
&quot; i did not meet any one in russian law-enforcement agencies or already anywhere , who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization &quot; , is an american center on the research of corruption and the organized crime is quoting mr galeotti .
also the professor of the university of welli george meijsona liz is agreeing with mr galeotti .
&quot; if they are also working jointly , this looks like a criminal net more , but not organization &quot; , - a center on the research of corruption and the organized crime is listing her words .
in the middle of the last year mark galeotti made supposition , that &quot; the brotherly circle &quot; is uniting approximated for the most part the russian thief in the law of the aslan usoyana , the well known one as the grandfather xasan .
the criminal authority was killed in january this year .
so , the activity of lawi wuwanawvili and kalawova zaxariya replenishing the list in 2012 was connected to the grandfather xasanom close and yet another participant of the list , temuri mirzoev , was the grandfather &apos;s xasanu nephew .
nevertheless mr galeotti notes that some personalities do not have the relationship to usoyanu either .
in his opinion , rather common financial and criminal interests , for example deliveries of the drugs from afghanistan united all their .
meanwhile the scandal around inclusion in &quot; the brotherly range &quot; of the gregory lepsa - dear singer of the president of vladimir putin &apos;s russia - attracted the attention of the kremlin .
it is natural , we are counting , which we will receive the more detailed information from our american co-workers partner , in connection with that such a decision was made , the head &apos;s of the state press spokesman dmitri peskov said why they brought it in into such lists .
it ( leps ) is the citizen of the russian federation at any rate .
just as as well as the interests of all the citizens of the russian federation , his interests will be defended .
tony blehr said that he will take advantage of the chance of a return as prime minister to great britain , but recognizes that the return is unlikely .
overnight in the interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of the departure from its post the 59-year-old politician presented his views on the different aspects of internal policy .
from the moment of retirement in june 2007 , after ten years in the post of the leader , blehr was avoiding the discussion of the british policy to a considerable degree limiting most of its comments to foreign matters and its the ambassador &apos;s role in the four of the middle eastern peacekeepers .
answering a question , i / you / he really returned it on the post of the prime minister , of blehr , according to london evening standard , said : « yes , of course , but scarcely this will happen , so what
the head trainer of &quot; milan &quot; massimiliano allegri expressed the regret concerning nicheijnogo result in the match of the 10th round of the championship of italy against &quot; lazio &quot; .
the specialist also noted that failures are stipulated by the series of the dribblers &apos; traumas on the start .
i regret really that we did not manage to win : tmw brings the words allegri .
the team played a solid match sozdav 3-4 good possibilities .
in the first half we did not allow &quot; lazio &quot; anything .
the romans grew in the second , but as a whole i can not say that we lost the concentration .
it was necessary to win .
in the past season we fulfilled the task of the entry into the champions &apos; league .
now we are losing touch with the graph but this is stipulated by the whole series of the traumas of the key soccer players .
the ramie and honda ?
these are very good players , with character .
however our composition is good also now .
look at kaka which spent the meeting on high level .
the british police are delivering assanzhu the notification of the delivery
the british police delivered the notification of the founder &apos;s delivery to wikileaks dzhuliana assanzha who hid in the embassy of ecuador in london and asked for the refuges today .
in the skotland yard they reported that they delivered the 40-year-old australian « an official demand to give up oneself » with the demand to come to the police station after adding , that in the event of the non-fulfillment of this demand it will be subject to arrest then .
an extradition to sweden in accusations of sex crimes is for assanzhu in store after he exhausted his possibilities in accordance with british law after the supreme court had turned his appeal down on an extradition earlier this month .
being afraid of stockholm passing it to the usa it hid in the embassy of ecuador in london after asking this south american country for the political refuge on 19th june .
the skotland yard « delivered the 40-year-old man the official demand to give up oneself by which he is obliged to arrive in the police station into a day and the time of our choice » as the press spokesman announced .
he has been disturbing the conditions of the liberation on guarantee as before .
the embassy refused to comment the handing of the notification to police .
assanzh is afraid , that it be ehkstradirovan from sweden in the usa for presentation for it the possible accusations of espionage after the publication of more than 250 000 american diplomatic messages on the speaker against secrecy the web site of wikileaks .
now roman senchin is on the presentation of his novel &quot; eltywevy &quot; translated into french in paris .
we will remind namely this his novel became the finalist of four prizes : &quot; the clear clearing &quot; , &quot; russian buker &quot; , &quot; the national best seller &quot; and &quot; the big book &quot; .
and last year behind this book the prize of the government for the russian federation was awarded to the writer in the field of culture .
roman senchin is an indubitable leader of the generation of present thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prozaikov .
practically every publication of his stories hard , built on modern life material and narratives causes the heated disputes among the critics of most different directions .
one can assert that the articles gathered together about prose and journalism senchina , the reviews on his books and magazine publications create the interesting and unexpected landscape of the russian literature from end of 1990 until the beginning of 2010th .
in the discussions about the works of &quot; one of the most controversial modern writers &quot; , according to critic sergei chuprinina , the speech is mainly being carried out about her participants understanding by a word &quot; literature &quot; what they see the present and the future of not only our literature , but also life as .
unfortunately , the volume of the book did not allow including the majority of the articles and the reviews from regional mass media and blogosfery in it
the analytical and review articles come , there are &quot; indentations as a rule , in the parts in reduction &quot; ... &quot;
can be snoudena to interrogate in russia
the ehks co-worker of american special services ehdvard snouden , most probably will not be , to go behind the limits of russia for testifying in matters of prosluwke of the telephone negotiations of the chancellor of germany the angels merkelj .
as source , acquainted with situation , declared &quot; to interfaksu &quot; on friday the american can answer the questions of the representatives of the chief public prosecutor &apos;s office to germany in written form or internally in russia .
the departure of the ehdvarda snoudena behind the limits of russia is practically excluded .
&quot; in this case it will lose the refugee &apos;s status and washington can be issued to by the countries - the allies of the usa &quot; , an interlocutor of the agency said .
&quot; at the same time , basically , the chief public prosecutor &apos;s office of the frg could have directed its representatives in the russian federation or would pass the written questions to snoudenu &quot; , added a source after adding that this question should be worked over at the intergovernmental level .
the deputy of the german bundestag xans-kristian wtrebele announced earlier that ehdvard snouden is ready to give the evidences in matter of prosluwke by the american special services of the negotiations of the chancellor of germany .
snouden is ready to give the evidences to the german law-enforcement agencies either in moscow or in the territory of germany .
the ehks co-worker of the cia gave to understand , that he really knows a great deal .
in spite of the fact that anb of the usa blockaded all his movements , snouden is ready to come to germany .
however it is necessary precisely for this to determine all conditions of his arrival &quot; , informed wtrebele to the television channel euronews .
lawyer snoudena anatoli kucherena declared that his client can cooperate with the german investigators commenting the statement of the source &quot; of interfaksa &quot; , but when and how is he will decide itself
the citizen of the usa ehdvard snouden working for the agency of the national security ( anb ) of the usa and the cia ran to hong kong , after that he promulgated the information about the secret operations of the special services of the usa on shadowing in an internet , in may 2013 .
snouden flew across moscow in the transit , but the airport did not manage to abandon the authorities of the usa externally making him serious accusations because they annulled his passport , and it was left behind until the beginning of august in the transit zone of the airport &quot; weremetjevo &quot; .
the first august snouden the document about the granting to it received the temporary refuge in the territory of russia lasting a year and on the same day abandoned &quot; weremetjevo &quot; .
yesterday the american &apos;s lawyer anatoli kucherena declared that his client established himself at a work into &quot; big russian company &quot; .
behind angeloij merkelj german mass media announced the shadowing anb last week .
according to the journalists &apos; data , the americans still in 2002 began to listen to the chancellor &apos;s telephone negotiations .
supposedly the station of tracking was located in the embassy of the usa in berlin .
the authorities of germany after the publication of these information declared that the shadowing disturbs the laws and the sovereignty of germany in merkelj .
the issue of the race series land rover is announced
there are the race seats and the six-dotted seat belts , as well as the system of the inner connection inside .
one can additionally receive the modernized brakes , the package of services , the providing access to mechanics bowler works , the logistical support and the storage of the car among the measures .
dryu bauler , the managing director of the company bowler motorsport , said : « the participants of rallye turning in bowler changed » .
some of them are not experienced racers , but people , looking for excitement , adventures and access to the measures of the world class .
we are happy to offer such a road in partnership with land rover and msa and think that the new way to test the different disciplines of rallye in great britain and abroad , as well as to prepare the participants for difficult conditions and the real facts of rallye offers this format raid .
we were working the car defender challenge out with big pleasure — this will be a really fascinating championship .

the children have to study the myths and the legends as « the models of way of life » , an author is saying .
the legends about the torus could have shown that « the brute force can not defeat the refined slyness » , and they show the legends about king arthur as it is important to have dream .
speaking , that many myths will turn out « too absurd , too scandalous also in some cases the too indecent ones for the teaching in the schools » , krossli-xolland is in favor of « the thorough selection » of the texts suitable according to age .
« i am counting , this is miraculous , that in america the myths and the folklore are already the part of the education » , he said .
i was in favor of their introduction to the training program twenty years .
he added , what « wards off « excessive moralizatorstvo » of the authors and the lecturers the interest with the children , but the main ideas « are sublimed » into fascinating histories .
krossli-xolland , who transferred « beovuljf » from the english saxon of language as well as wrote « the collection of the norwegian myths » penguin and « british people &apos;s tales » are for the publishing house , i / you / he said : « you , of course , can have intentions , but it is better for you to hold them to himself
a necessity to feel some hope , possibly , is the big distinction between the adult author , the author writing for the adults , and adult writing for the children .
not that that should be simplified always or happy koncovke to be brought , but it is necessary that an innate understanding of good and the evil was .
also this should be sublimed ; uncoveredly across history , and not precisely is formulated .
old principle : you have to point and it is not possible to say .
goldman sachs gave advance notice of risks for the russian economy
goldman sachs gave advance notice of the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in russia - the consumption .
this above all the crisis of the nonpayments according to unsupported consumer credit and the workers &apos; mass reductions .
our main anxiety now is not that the growth became slower , but rather , the structure of this growth .
recently it is completely stipulated by the consumption which does almost not reduce the revolutions &quot; , declared the head economist goldman sachs on russia klemens the column presenting the quarterly report of investbanka on the russian economy yesterday .
soon there is nominal growth of the wages about 10 % in russia .
on inflation of 6 % it will be able to provide the future consumer demand approximately at the current level , are expecting in goldman sachs .
but the profitability of the russian companies falls , therefore , most probably , they will begin the optimization of the expenses for personnel .
today we see the essential growth of the share of the wages in the gdp : i / you / he explained , if the wages grow of 10 % , the gdp is only of 2 % , mr the column .
the companies encountered the reduction of profitability .
if it will not grow , this can lead to some dismissals and the growth of unemployment .
wages are not able to raise a russian business , the head economist of barclays capital on russia and cis vladimir pantyuwin is commenting .
unemployment is close to the historic minimums , competition for the workers is high .
in order to entice the attentive co-workers or to retain the present ones , the employers have to pick up the wages .
the consumption in russia podder ­ zhivaetsya also with the very fast growth of potrebkreditovaniya .
on opinion g-on the graph , due to extremely high stakes on the consumer loans of the muljtiplikativnogo effect on the economy of the country this type of crediting not provides .
&quot; we did not see the benefit for the economy from the growth of potrebkreditovaniya as any , the money is not varying on the economy , and are returning to the same banks in the form of the interest-bearing payments &quot; , said an economist .
but problem is into the friend in goldman sachs they are expecting the growth of delay according to uncovered credits .
mainly scanty people are taking them , which there is nothing to grant into support .
the interests on such loans are high .
like consequence they &quot; are not &quot; returning &quot; them to the thicket noted , mr the column .
therefore there is the second threat to the growth of the economy in russia the possible crisis of the nonpayments according to uncovered credits .
the director of the bank institute vweh basil solodkov sees the signs of the ripening bank crisis already now .
small credit institutions , without having the access to the cheap resources , what the state banks have , the resources had to attract the populations just before the high interests .
into answer the state banks came out to the path of war and they started reducing credit rates : an economist continues .
the small credit institutions are not able to issue the loans at the same interests , otherwise they will have a negative interest margin .
if the state banks will not refuse a dumping , full-fledged bank crisis is for russia in store , thinks basil solodkov .
the economist considers the deprivation of the licenses of the row of banks to be a herald of the mass crash in the last weeks .
&quot; themselves the state banks will not manage such a situation : the system of the insurance of deposits was originally not calculated for a system crisis &quot; , is giving the head of the institute advance notice .
but the growth of consumption will become slower also without crisis of nonpayments , they think in investbanke is , due to the refusal of the indexing of the wages of the civil servants and the soldiers , be laid in the current version of the budget estimates .
the blow to consumption will partially be softened by the zamorozkoij of tariffs of natural monopolies ( and as consequence the reduction of inflation ) .
but only partially : anyway , if the capital investments will not grow ( and the prerequisites to this have not been here yet - watch the information ) , the growth of consumption will become slower , is assured of goldman sachs .
vladimir pantyuwin has not seen the prerequisites to the realization of the pessimistic scenarios of barclays capital yet .
&quot; the main risk has been a slump in price of mineral oil as before &quot; , he is saying .
according to his estimate , the economy of russia will begin to decrease at the cost of the mineral oil beneath 90 $ / barrel .
in goldman sachs they also noted what not to reduce the central bank in some forces interest rates in the economy yet .
the paradoxical picture is being watched : the inflation came down , and the banks started picking up rates .
this can mean that they did not confide to the central bank which declared the transition to targetirovaniyu of inflation &quot; told klemens the column .
the interest policy of the central bank does not influence some market rates , influences only the rates of the interbank crediting .
&quot; for the central bank this is a crash of all the hopes &quot; , is appraised klemens the column .
they are using the money , the central banks which were received on the auctions , the banks not for the granting of credit of the economy , but for a department of their liquidity
as soon as the rate is coming down , exchange rate is changing immediately , this means , what try resources to go on speculations against the rouble .
i / you / he said &quot; sooner or later the central bank will understand that this strategy &quot; does not &quot; work &quot; mr the column and i / you / he reminded , on that letting go the rouble into &quot; a free cruise the state plans towards the end of 2015 .
but one will have to do either this earlier , or to pick up the key rate of the central bank ( 5.5 % ) , he thinks .
according to his estimate , the exchange rate of the rouble is artificially set too high by 10 % now .
i chop only one expensive - to weaken , - an expert is coming to conclusion .
but if the central bank will shed in the financial expert the shade of the doubt about the liquidation of the exchange corridor not being not the part of the policy for the purpose of the weakening of the rouble at least this much more strongly can demolish the rouble .
snouden agreed to give merkelj the evidences concerning prosluwke
the deputy of the bundestag gans-kristian wtrebele met moscow with ehdvardom snoudenom .
in the course of talk the issue was being discussed can really snouden to be interrogated as witness by the chief public prosecutor &apos;s office of the frg in matter of possible prosluwke of the telephone of the chancellor of germany specslcuzhbami of the usa .
snouden expressed the readiness to give the necessary evidences .
the meeting could have taken place either in moscow or in germany .
he gave precisely to understand , said gans-kristian wtrebele : that he really knows mnogoe .
and in spite of the fact that the agency of the national security is being managed by the whale alexander blockaded his movements all , snouden is ready to come to germany .
however it is necessary at first precisely to determine all conditions of his arrival . .
meanwhile , the american legislators begin to take measures in reply to the scandal around the spy programs of the usa .
the senate secret service yesterday committee approved the bill which is bringing additional restrictions to the activity of the american department of the electronic secret service .
fau : « the air passengers can use gadzhety by planes ( but it is not allowed to call from the car telephone ) now »

but the passengers do not have to expect that the changes will occur immediately .
as such a change is realized fast , it will vary depending on airline , said administrator fau michael uehrta on press conference .
the airlines will have to show fau as their planes correspond to new guiding principles both that are renewing their teaching aids for members of flying crew and governed on the packing of the devices , in order to correspond to new guiding principles .
fau declared that it has already received the plans from some airlines of the expansion of the use of the portable electronic devices in the planes .
delta and jetblue were among the airlines which have already presented the plans .
« depending on the state of the plan we could very soon have approved the expansion of the use of the electronic devices » , declared fau .
at present the passengers are obliged to cut off their smartfony , the map cases and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closing .
they do not have to perezapuskatj them while the plane will not be reaching the height with 10 000 feet and the captain will not be giving « good » .
the passengers have to turn off their devices again , when the plane is coming down for landing , and do not to include them while the plane will not be turning up on earth
in accordance with new guiding principles , the airlines whose planes are properly defended against electronic disturbances can let the passengers use these devices during take-off , landing and the steering , fau declared .
the majorities of the new airliners and other planes modified in this way correspond to these criteria that the passengers could employ wi-fi at big heights as he is being expected .
laura gleijding , the president of the association of the professional stewards , i / you / she welcomed these changes .
« after the new policy will be realized successfully ( and we are preparing to work in narrow contact with the ferryman in order to achieve this ) , this will be a safe version » , gleijding declared .
we got openly tired of feeling « like persons on duty on the school » when it is coming to this question .
but web access for the surfing , the exchange of the e-mails , text messages or the download of the ones given anyway will be prohibited from at a height less than 10 000 feet , announced an agency .
it will be offered for the passengers into the regime of the plane to switch his smartfony , the map cases and other devices .
in this way , as before any « words with the friends » is intellectual internet game , into which the actor alek played baldwin on his smartfone in 2011 , after the nawumevwiij case occurred : the actor was taken off the plane of the airline american airlines for the rejection to turn off the device at that time , when the plane was near an exit to landing .
and it will be necessary as before to put the heavier devices such as the notebooks , in the luggage compartment in so far as they can traumatize anybody if they will fly on the whole parlor .
the bells from the car telephone are also in the flight will be as before are prohibited .
a regulating power in the telephone bells belongs to federal connection commission , and not fau .
fau can remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landings
last month mark is rozenker from national counsel on security of the transport , a national security of the transportations cbs news expert , declared that the cellular telephones have been considered risk as before .
« the cellular telephones are valid problem , not only because they can potentially create the disturbances for the navigation devices , but we know thanks to fks that they can create the disturbances for the towers of honeycomb connection when the plane is in air » rozenker said .
the branch advisory committee created by fau for the research of this question recommended that the government resolved the wider use of the personal electronic devices last month .
in the last years the pressure on fau with the aim of the weakening of the restrictions to their use increased .
they are asserting , the critics as the democrat-senator are from the staff of missouri klehr makkaskil , what for bans no important reason connected to security is not .
the observance of restrictions is also beginning more and more complicatedly to provide because the application of the devices became general .
some researches show that up to third of the passengers forget or up to third of the passengers ignore the instructions to turn off its devices .
fau began to limit the use as passengers of the electronic devices in 1966 in reply to messages about disturbances for the one navigation and the communication equipment when the passengers began to take the fm receiving sets with themselves — high technology gadzhety of that time .
the new airliners are much more более зависимыми from electric systems than the previous generations of the planes , but they are also being developed and fau is being confirmed as resistant to electronic disturbances .
the airlines have been offering the passengers the use wi-fi in the cruised height already for a few years .
the planes modified for wi-fi-sistem are also more resistant to disturbances .
the overwhelming majority of the liners is adapted for the wider use of the electronic devices according to new guiding principles , said uehrta .
the today &apos;s electronic devices are normally radiating the radio signals of the much lower power than the previous generations of the devices .
the devices of the reading of the e-books , for example , are radiating only the minimum signals on leafing of pages .
but the signals are becoming more powerful when the devices are downloading or send data .
there was a company amazon.com among those who attempted the softening of the restrictions to the use by the passengers of the electronic devices .
in 2011 the representatives of the company loaded the intact airliner with their devices of the reading of the e-books kindle and they flew in it in order to check the presence of the problems , but tak i ne they did not discover them .
the members of advisory committee fau expressed mixed feelings concerning whether an application of the devices presenting some risk .
duglas kidd declared the passengers from national association , which has considered disturbances real from the devices even if risk is minimum .
other members of the committee said that there are only separate messages of the pilots confirming what the devices can create the disturbances for aircraft systems , and most of these messages the very old ones .
nevertheless the committee recommended that fau let the pilots demand of the passengers to cut off the devices during landings on the instruments with regard to the limited visibility .
the group of the representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes calling them the sensible step towards the passengers who now are using the mass of the technological devices .
« we are happy about fau recognizing that the passengers &apos; comfort is not incompatible with security and defense » , said rodzher dou , the general manager of the tourist association of the usa .
vilnius is suspecting moscow of the attempt to oklevetatj the lithuanian president
russia is intending to carry out the information provocations against the prominent persons of lithuania and the countries of the eastern partnership - republics ( dgb ) did such a statement for the agency bns in the department of the security police .
the information about this is published on the portal delfi .
in particular , according to message moscow is preparing &quot; to stipulate &quot; the president of lithuania dalyu gribauskaijte and to publish sfaljsificirovannye documents , supposedly found into the russian one the state archive , which are concerning the facts from the biography of the lithuanian leader .
according to data a department of the analysis of the public processes of the department of the administration of the president of russia according to inter-region and cultural connections with the foreign countries is leading the special services , the preparation of the information attack .
eugene umerenkov visiting lithuania time and again and taking part in the congress of the lithuanian people &apos;s party is heading structure .
also the co-worker of the department v. smirnov is the participant of operation supposedly .
as the special service is reconfirming , smirnov under shelter came scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly to lithuania and i / you / he contacted with the local politicians , the political scientists and the representatives of the mass media .
now smirnov is prohibited from entry on the territory of the country .
the day before the president of lithuania gribauskaijte declared about that , that he knows about that being in the making on it informatake .
in her opinion , a successful chair of lithuania of the european union &apos;s counsel and &quot; a striving of the country for energy independence &quot; are main thing from reasons
the lithuanian leader did not criticize the activity of the russian authorities earlier once .
like that she was declaring that they are treating lithuania &quot; insufficiently respectfully in the kremlin .
moreover , gribauskaijte accused the head of vladimir putin &apos;s russian federation of the advancement to lithuania of &quot; one &quot; of only the demands .
we will remind , in september rospotrebnadzor stopped the import of lithuanian &quot; molochki &quot; to russia .
it was being announced that the quality of the production does not correspond to epidemiological norms .
at that time the leader of lithuania declared , what if russia will not take off ban , the government of the country has to prepare the circulation into the wto .
new anti-nicotinic vaccine can deprive the process of the smoking of pleasure
the scientists worked out anti-nicotinic vaccine which could have deprived the process of smoking of the cigarettes of pleasure .
one dose of vaccine has managed to protect the mice from nicotinic dependence on the whole life .
further tests are necessary until the beginning of the tests on the people , that a few years will be needed for , but professor ronaljd declared the crystal from the medical college uehijll kornell in new york , which the first results assure .
« we hope that such a strategy of the application of vaccine can help , at last , millions of the smokers which tried to quit after checking all the methods that are available in the market today really , but discovered , what their nicotinic dependence sufficiently strong in order to overcome it with the help of these modern resources » professor kornell said .
new vaccine contains the harmless virus which was worked out so that to support the genetic information for the production of the anti-nicotinic antibodies .
the virus infects izbirateljno the cells of the liver which then begin to make the stable stream of the antibodies .
they are tracking down the antibodies just any molecule of nicotine in blood neutralizing them before they are reaching their brain averting the receipt by the smoker of the nicotinic blow .
the mice in tests vakcinirovannye to which they subsequently gave nicotine continued their normal activity .
and the mice to which they did not give vaccine « were being weakened » , and this is a sign that nicotine reached to their brain , are saying researchers .
these experiments are described in magazine science translational medicine .
the previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained the antibodies .
it was so often necessary in order to keep the high level of the antibodies to do the injections that they turned out to be dear and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine , probably , will be much lower because it is turning the cells of the liver into antibody factories .
the professor said the crystal , what if vaccine that is human was completely safe , the children could be allowed to give it averting the nicotinic dependence before with them the wish to test the cigarette will appear .
but it is more probably that it will be employed to quit smoking by the smokers .
« they will know , what if they began to smoke again , they will not receive from this pleasure due to nicotinic vaccine , and this can help them to get rid of this habit » , said it
the british scientists said that results were interesting , but gave advance notice that additional researches are necessary .
prewinter efforts .
what is necessary to do in the garden until the beginning of the night frost

frontier airlines will impose a pay on the hand luggage
frontier airlines is planning on collecting 100 $ from the passengers for their being carrying hand luggage on the board of his flight .
frontier airlines is planning on beginning to impose up to 100 $ on coffee or gazirovku behind the hand luggage and $ 2 although their announcement said on wednesday that the passengers will be able to leave themselves the whole can .
the new charge for the hand luggage is concerning the bags in the top baggage compartments , therefore the small bags which are put under the seat will remain free .
frontier told that he will impose 25 $ also to 100 $ if the collection is being paid for beforehand after if the traveling ones will pay only turning up near an exit to landing .
the representative kate o &apos;mehlli frontier said that the pay has to force of 100 $ the passengers to take care of the payment beforehand .
« we do not want to impose the pay on this » , she said .
the airlines began to impose the charge for the first and the second bag which is handed in to the luggage , in 2008 .
the passengers that are trying to avoid these collections are paving so many , how much will be able , into the hand luggage due to what in these compartments being put in the top baggage compartments does not suffice place often .
the collections are one of the ways to force the passengers it to carry less on the board .
o &apos;mehlli said , what this new collection as a matter of fact not for the sake of earning of money .
the thing is that the most loyal clients frontier are declaring , what to find place in the top baggage compartments is becoming all more difficult .
the passengers will not have to pay who are buying the tickets on the site of the airline .
this means that one passenger in line can have near exit to the flight frontier the opportunity one to carry the bag freely while the following passenger 100 $ can pay at lines for the same bag .
o &apos;mehlli said that the change of procedures is called upon on the web site and near the counters of the registration frontier to guarantee that the passengers will know about a collection before they are winding up to an exit to landing .
the new collection frontier for the hand luggage will not begin to be imposed until the summer although the date is not fixed yet .
passengers often complain about a charge for the luggage and some other collections , but the airlines are adoring them .
they assert that the processing of the luggage costs the money , and the passengers who need this service have to pay for it
many people consider the addition of baggage collections to be the sign of the airlines imposing sufficiently the money in order to cover the expenditures on aviaperelety after a few years of damages on uoll-strit .
however most of them did not concern the collections for the hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc . i / you / she brought the first collection for the hand luggage three years ago , and i / you / he yet another diskaunter allegiant air later followed her example .
hungarian wizz air is another only airline with such a collection , the consultant on the airlines of dzheij sorensen who is attentively registering the additional collections said .
according to his estimate in report from december 2011 , the collection for the hand luggage brings spirit of $ 50 million in a year .
sorensen , the former top-manager midwest airlines , flew in the flight spirit recently , and it was interesting for him what he will discover near an exit to landing after the passengers will encounter an unusual collection spirit for the hand luggage .
« the process of landing was the smoothest of those , which i saw for my career in airlines » , he said .
i expected to see the gnashing of the teeth and the beginnings of the fight near exit to landing .
the plane was full , he said , « also the landing turned out precipitantly » .
frontier also follows spirit with regard to the pay of $ of 2 behind coffee , tea , gazirovku or juice .
frontier declared what can leave themselves the passengers who are receiving gazirovku or juice the whole can and that will be granted the topping of coffee freely .
she will distribute freely water as before .
us airways tried to impose the pay on the drinks in 2008 the brief time , but refused this in seven months after the passengers began to complain and no another big airline followed her example .
the initiative frontier on the collection of the charge for the hand luggage when the passengers are not buying tickets directly from airline is her last measure concerning soliciting new business on its web site
the airlines are paying to the onlaijn-sellers of the tickets as orbitz , from 10 $ up to 25 $ behind every sold ticket .
this let all the airlines encourage the passengers stimulus to buy the tickets from them outright , and it is not allowed to turn to a tourist onlaijn agency .
however frontier went furthest in this field
in september it began to give the clients who bought the tickets across online tourist agency twice few bonus миль of the often flying passenger .
on wednesday it cut off the bonus number of the miles up to 25 percent from the miles of trip .
so , the trip of 1000 miles has been from frontier , acquired at online tourist agency , would have allowed receiving 250 miles .
moreover , the passengers may choose the place beforehand provided that they are buying the tickets directly on the site frontier .
frontier has a base of the loyal clients in her denver home town , but her business is decreasing and it is becoming unprofitable .
the gain was reduced by 9 percent , and the flying possibilities decreased by hardly 13 percent in the first quarter , according to the financial results published by the parental company republic airways holdings inc on wednesday .
republic is trying to adjust the finances frontier within the framework of the sale to airline .
putin achieved the impunity for his assad &apos;s friend
but now news from behind the ocean is , but namely is from syria , where , how started being to us well known today , israel dealt the blow to the rockets of the russian production which were meant &quot; by xezbolle &quot; , according to reports .
today syria fulfilled the important condition : to destroy its productions of the cbr weapon by the 1st november .
this was done within the framework of the agreement reached on the intervention of russia and allowing the usa not to conduct the war operation which they approached close this summer .
our international head correspondent richard ehngelj will talk about the weapons also about this meaning everyone for the syrian president in a more detailed way .
washington declared that assad &apos;s regime will be punished for this .
more than 1400 civil inhabitants , including hundreds of the children , died of poisonous gas in august .
also the punishment came .
but not in the form of the american bombardments , but in the form of the transaction which assad &apos;s friend organized vladimir putin is .
syria will refuse its cbr weapon to the middle of the next year .
also today an important landmark is .
the group of the international experts announced that syria took the declared factories along the production of the ximoruzhiya from a system .
the longer term and difficult task is a destruction of the tons of cbr weapon and components to his place .
as us we understand , this about a thousand tons .
washington said earlier that assad &apos;s days are counted .
i am counting , assad has to leave .
the question not in whether this happening , but in when this will happen .
it is not legitimen any more and has to leave .
but assad remains .
also he feels even more confidently .
his troops have been using artillery , rockets and napalm as before .
his enemies are estranged and are badly armed .
his people are forcedly abandoning its houses , many people are starving .
several things have to be fed by the leaves and the cats .
many people think that bawar assad avoided the punishment for the slaughter .
they are calling the agreement on the cbr weapon the success of the diplomacy , nobelevskuyu awarded the purse of the peace to the inspectors , and himself assad made a person &apos;s , ready for the cooperation , impression .
today in washington the ambassador of the usa had to answer some complicated questions in syria .
when the child is perishing with hunger , his mothers are scarcely lighter from their not killing it with the help of the cbr weapon .
assad has been being held yet .
and weapons are exchanging for an authority .
tomich will earn 240 hours behind the extremist roller in socseti
the lenin district court of tomsk sentenced the inhabitant of the town who videorolik of extremist direction put in a social net to 240 o &apos;clock of the obligatory work , the representative of the news service informed ria of news on friday regional the ships .
according to the data of the court , in march 2013 , the man put on his page in a popular social net the video recording which is brought in into the federal list of the extremist materials .
with regard to it was aroused the criminal case on the article of penal code the russian federation of &quot; action , the person &apos;s merits directed towards the stimulation of hatred and hostility , as well as towards a humiliation are made publicly &quot; .
&quot; the lenin district court discussed the present matter in a particular order and declared the man guilty of the perpetration of the abovementioned crime after fixing the punishment in the form of 240 hours of the obligatory work &quot; said an interlocutor of the agency .
she added that the man completely recognized his guilt .
the parents of the interseksualjnyx children can choose « the indefinite floor »
germany became the first european country which recognized the third floor with the children given birth to with the outward sex organs of the intermediate type .
they will any more attribute a man or female floor to the neonates certainly .
the new law is not requiring of the parents to call such children &apos;s floor some allowing the parents to indicate the floor as « indefinite » or « unstated » one in their evidences about the birth .
was the goal of the law to take a pressure off the parents who can make the hurried decisions about the operation on conferring of floor on the neonates , and to counteract the discrimination of the interseksualjnyx people .
one interseksualjnyij person said , according to bbc , many years later : « i am not a man and not the woman » .
i will remain a patchwork product created by the doctors with the bruises and scars .
approximately one of two thousand children that are born annually it is neither a boy , nor a girl .
they have an intersexuality , one of approximately 60 pathological states which hit under the diagnosis of « the violation of the sexual development » — collective term for the people with the atipichnymi chromosomes , the gonads ( the ovaries or semennikami ) or the unusual outward developing sex organs .
uollis simpson was interseksualom , possibly .
the gender identification is studied up to now insufficiently , however the majorities of the experts are speaking to the usa , that if the floor can not be determined it is better to take advantage of the whole available information and to appropriate it than to wait and to register the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before the carrying out of operation , if , in general , this will occur .
the new york psychiatrist , doctor dzhek the thresher who is specializing in problems of the gender identification said that the new german law « sounds like a good idea » .
the children are creating ethical dilemma for interseksualjnye .
« some people have violations which are requiring a functional intrusion threatening lives , the majority of the children does however not have them » , he said .
you can appropriate the floor without operation and then look as personality is developing .
the science about how the child will develop some gender identity is not too precise .
no one can answer the questions about why this occurs .
this like the riddle about why the people are homosexual sometimes .
or transgendernyx , in so far as their state has relationship i do not genderu to the report sent to a european commission in 2011 describes the interseksualjnyx people as those different from the transsexual ones , but to their biological building which does not correspond exceptionally to neither man , nor female floor , and is typically not characteristic of both either simultaneously not for one of them .
these characteristics can be seen in second sexual such as muscular mass , the allocation of the hair cover , the breast and the build signs ; primary sexual signs , such signs as reproductive organs and genitalii , or in the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones .
the report also gives the concept about discrimination , from which they have been coming across interseksualjnye and transgendernye the people in the sphere of employment , as well as about the level of pritesneniij , cruelty and crimes on the ground of prejudices .
the boys with the gender deviations have a special camp now .
australia and nepal have let already the adults put man , female one or « the third floor » is in its official documents .
in june the 52-year-old inhabitant of australia norri mehij-uehlbi became the first in the peace person declared « sexless » after asserting in the court the right to storage of the « indefinite » sexual status on the whole life .
according to the department of the interior of the interior , the third designation in addition to the m and f — the x one , that is interseksualjnyij will be used for the german passports .
in neighboring france gender questions have still caused contradictions , according to the news issue on canal france 24 .
in 2011 dozens of the legislators are from france , this brightly expressed catholic country , signed the petition about the withdrawal of « the gender theory » from the school textbooks .
the american web site catholic online also expressed the disagreement with german law after writing what « in the situation when the peace is getting used to a new state , where the floor is the object of choice , and the sexual activity is not no , we are turning » still two pillars of civilization over .
one mother of the newborn child also announced web from maryland-the site baby zone that she would have preferred so that the children established floor on the birth .
« raising a child is enough seriously and without additional restrictions if you do not know your child &apos;s skirts especially » she told the web site for the parents .
the children need stability and confidence .
they were historically calling hermaphrodites the children given birth to with the man and female sex organs — on the name of beautiful greek god who possessed the signs both of the floors .
and ten years still in total ago the medical association perceived gender as a sheet on which one can wash everything , but then draw again .
but now many people are contesting the ethical bases for the surgical operation knowing that the gender identity is complicated , and sometimes , as the child will perceive the floor which was conferred upon him when it grows , the doctors make a false choice while not knowing .
« in the middle of the 20th century this was called : with &quot; pressing psychiatric case &quot; » , a thresher said .
when such children were born : you were calling not the psychiatrist you called the surgeon .
the dominating theory about how to turn with the children with genitaliyami of intermediate type was offered mani from the university dzhonsa xopkinsa who thought that gender is giving way to change easily by the doctor john .
it introduced into a circulation « gender identity » term will be and i / you / he asserted that the signals of the environment , the signals social among them — then , as the parents are raising the child , — interact with the genes and the child &apos;s hormones while determining , really the person to consider himself to be a man or a woman .
but they turned up under a question in one case of 1966 , well known as « dzhon / dzhoan » , his theory .
he advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision to castrate the child after removing also his testicles completely , and to raise it as the girl .
« do not attract presented case like the successful example of the transition , but this was so » : a thresher said .
after there was the boy about 15 , it became a boy again and got married to the woman .
but at the age of 38 years he carried out the suicide .
the thresher said that now some doctors have still been « using this model » .
but in 1990th , with internet &apos;s receipts , the people that survived these operations on the change of the floor declared about themselves with , dissatisfied , result .
i / you / he was such and the case of dzhima bryusa , the 36-year-old writer from staff of montana which was born with the man &apos;s chromosomes xy , but genitaliyami of intermediate type .
they could not determine the doctor in an exact way , it had the big clitoris or the small penis , and it was convinced that it will never be able to live for the man &apos;s full-fledged « life » .
therefore the outer sex organ and the testicles bryusa were surgically soon after his birth in 1976 removed , and it was being cultivated as the girl .
female hormones have started putting him at 12 years at the age .
« i knew that i am not a girl » is told it abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was really complicated to ask the questions .
at the age of 18 years vaginoplastika was prescribed to him .
but being knowing about a depression also something , what something not so , he demanded the medical documentation .
what he recognized was terrible .
i was sterilized on the birth , and no one has ever told me about this .
bryus was born with the violation of the sexual development which did not let his body make sufficiently the testosterone for the normal development of genitaliij .
after recognizing the truth , it became a man again receiving its breast after also removing the injections of the testosterone .
the operation made it infertile .
today it appears under a name interface project into the defense of the other ones in organization trying to bring the perception of the people with intersexuality into a norm .
but ehnn tehmar-mehttis , the executive director of the californian legal association advocates for informed choice , is worried about what is « inciting » the german law « to navewivaniyu of labels and a stigma » .
many activists are worried about that : that the german law will incite parents to make a hurried decision and to give the child &quot; an indefinite floor &quot; » , she said .
we are afraid that he will contribute to the intrusion .
i am being counted , the man or female floor better to appropriate , but then to wait .
but therefore we have not seen yet what we can make as this law will show itself all : to build this suppositions .
tehmar-mehttis said that her organization is maintaining the australian law in so far as « it is allowing the adult people to make the choice for the benefit of the third floor » .
« the adult people have to have the opportunity to make its own decisions about formal sexual accessories she is saying .
the german law means her appropriation on the birth .
this battle which the small children do not have to enter on this stage .
when they grow , they will be able to make the decisions about their own body at that time .
but dr arlin barac , the mammolog radiologist from pittsburg , which has a daughter with the violation of the sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in group of support , i / you / she said that the german law « will support » both the parents and the children .
the daughter barac , kehti , was born with the man &apos;s chromosomes , however it has a violation of the sexual development « the syndrome of the complete insensitiveness to the androgens » under name .
in so far as her androgenic receptors discourteously function , kehti developed the female signs .
it has vagina , but there are a uterus and ovaries .
now , at the age of 29 years kehti is married and is studying ordinaturu on children &apos;s psychiatry in the university of pennsylvania .
in spite of the fact that it is fruitless , she is hoping to become a father by means of adoption or gestacionnogo ersatz maternity .
« the law gives the parents the time in order not to make themselves the hurried decisions » , said barac .
it is giving them « man » or « female » one the time to do some analyses and to know a lot in a situation , as well as the time interval before they will write .
in such a case you are in an order — raise the child , like the child .
you have a wonderful child , and you feel joy .
we do not need to carry out hurriedly the operation which is irreversible .
this allows the children to participate in the decision and eliminates excitement , who is moving the parents because they do not feel that they are acting correctly » she said .
finally the child will decide , with what floor for it or for it comfortable , — also this is fabulous .
this gives the children the chance to make the decision independently .
the secretary of state of the usa : special services at times they &quot; stopped by at too far &quot; on data acquisition
the state secretary of the usa the john kerri recognized that with data acquisition and prosluwkax the american special services &quot; stopped by at too far &quot; at times , nevertheless the politician noted that the information about prosluwke of 70 million people which appeared in mass media does not correspond to reality .

the experts of the horse-racing measures , gather to cardiff , in order to fight behind the prize « horse of the year » , they knew that the competition will be very high .
but no one was ready to the appearance three-year-old fentona kirklanda .
still even not the schoolboy , only a few months before this promchalsya which made its first steps , this kid with its pupil with the shetland pony toffi at a trot is the main prize across three rounds in order to take with facility , after leaving 30 adult rivals far behind .

azarov promised the ukrainians the collapse of the prices of the goods after the signature of the association with the european union
nicholas azarov prime minister of ukraine is convinced that the prices have come down in the country after the country has signed the agreement on association with the european union considerably .
he reported this in the course of the contact with the readers of his page on &quot; feijsbuke &quot; .
i can say that the prices are being determined by the large number of the factors among which there are also customs tariffs , among them , in a certain way .
so , after the signature of agreement and attachment the free trade area regulations , the level of the customs duties on the import of the goods from the ec will come down considerably .
and this will mean that also the prices have to come down .
this as for the goods which are coming from the countries of the eu &quot; wrote azarov .
as for other goods , that influence of the agreement on prices will not be such straight lines , it will be indirect .
but , nevertheless , there also has to be no increase in prices .
therefore the messages on bilbordax which recently appeared in our country sufficiently a lot that the association with the ec is a rise in prices , this not quite so , or if it is more precise to speak - not at all so , - azarov summarized .
the package of the rescue measures at the rate of $ 325 million for the health service of tasmania
the federal government is insisting on the package of the rescue measures at the rate of $ 325 million for the weakened health services of tasmania being supplemented by the hard conditions which guarantee that the government of the staff will not waste the resource in vain .
the federal health secretary tatyana plibersek announced that the friendship takes « emergency measures » in order to avert the crisis more caused by the age deterioration of the population of this island staff the higher level of the chronic diseases and the restrictions of the system .
the decision about financing for four years was made after the consultations of the government with the independent deputy of andrew uilki tasmania .
« the government offered the package of the emergency rescue measures , which , we believe , it will resolve the specific problems , being in front of a staff mrs plibersek declared today .
the package with a size of 325 $ includes млн into themselves $ 31 million on blic campaign on the planned operations .
another 2600 operations , including the orthopedic operations and the operations on the removal of cataract , they will help to overcome the lag .
there is also money for clinics , sick recipients without preliminary entry , in xobarte i lonsestone , for the rise in the quality of departure after the ward , teaching of the medical specialists , the services of the protection of mental health and the introduction systems of the personal electronic medical cards in the local hospitals .
these capital investments will go to stated by the advanced doctors mrs plibersek said « the realization of the ideas about how better to help the health services of tasmania » .
the minister was insisting that the government of tasmania will work in the regime of strict accounts and responsibility .
the staff will need to maintain the current levels of financing in order to receive the financial resources of friendship , and to give a report monthly about where he wastes these adminicles .
the commission of three people will be created so that to make that the staff is granting the services as much as more efficiently and is more effective sure .
g-n uilki declared today that $ will not solve 325 million anything « if the genuine reform which will install the health services of tasmania on a more stable basis will not follow them » .
nevertheless he praised the government for the answer to his request for urgent help which it turned with to the prime minister for the first time at the beginning of may .
« i hope that the package of the federal help will contribute to the conclusion of the health services of this staff from critical state considerably » said mr uilki .
according to the data of the government of the staff these additional selective procedures compensate for the recent reductions to a considerable degree .
but the federal opposition representative in piter health service datton thinks that the today &apos;s statement is « the decision , analogous in sticking plaster . »
« the reason as for which we are here lies in the fact that the labourite government of the staff tore $ 430 million out of the health services » , he told the television station abc tv .
when the government of the staff is tearing hardly half a billion of the dollars off , and the friendship puts 300 million , it is not allowed to pretend , that these are good news .
g-n datton asked mrs plibersek to guarantee that there will be spent not a single dollar on an additional bureaucracy from the rescue package .
the cry of the despair of the voter obamy
i voted for president obamu twice dividing hope into the possibility of changes
he is speaking , that obama allowed obstructionism it is not possible to reduce the republicans no to any laudable efforts .
obstructionism is not able to serve as a justification of problems with the web site of obamoij of the health services being reformed , the attack of bespilotnikov
the memoirs about the campaign of obamy of 2008 are sad reminding of what could be
nataniehlj p. morris is the student of second course of the medical faculty of garvardskogo university .
i am reading the terribly sad book during these days .
i thought that this book will inspire me in the times of the dejection on the second course of the medical faculty and will revive the feeling of hope in me .
it is called « insolence for victory » , and these are memoirs about barak obamy of 2008 presidential campaign .
when am i finishing with the evening to write the reports on my patients and am i lying into the bed , does this book return me at that time when the policy inspired millions of the people , and the talks could take spirit .
the victory at elections turned out to be impressive , also the leading ones did news programs break for the comprehension of this historic moment .
my classmates cried with joy , and my parents took care of all the newspapers which they could only find .
to the white house young strategist team had to come , and the people were ready to the changes .
during the entry in 2008 obamy into post his level of support was 82 % .
then i am closing a book .
return into present is a rough awakening , like pulling out from dream .
it is difficult to remember optimism those days — they seem like distant memory , sad reminding of the missed possibilities .
in years which passed ever since i lowered my first ballot paper the changes have really occurred .
this was that , which i did even not can imagine .
i am giving due to obame for his big and diverse achievements , from the passage of the law on intelligible medical care before our soldiers &apos; withdrawal from iraq , &quot; do not ask &quot; for the abolition of the rule , « do not « speak » , the murders of the usamy ben ladena .
furthermore , i think that the party obstructionism blockaded too many attempts of the advancement of our country ahead : immigration reform , the possibility of the choice of the state health service and the closing of the base in guantanamo among other ones .
but protecting it in front of the co-workers and the contemporaries , with me after the countless number of the times , when i was turning up in the side of the administration obamy , the explanations which i can grant ended .
i reached the point of the political despair .
the republicans &apos; obstructionism can not explain the permission for prosluwku of foreign leaders or the infliction of the hits with bespilotnikami on the innocent children in other countries .
he can not explain the data acquisition about the americans &apos; private life by the agency of the national security or the pursuits of razoblachiteleij discovering the illegitimate activities of the government .
he can not explain the murder of the american citizen anvara to alj-avlaki without court and consequences or the inobservance of the limits of state financing and expenses are during the presidential campaigns .
it can not find excuses for the conclusions of the report in which it is being said that the efforts applied by the white house are most « aggressive » in order that to force mass media to become silent « … since the times of niksona administration » .
and recently it can not justify what it is not possible to develop the simple web site into the flow of more than three years after the signature of the law on intelligible medical care .
i do not know whether i should expect this .
i / you / he really owes was at the age to understand that the instruction can contradict the political campaigns which precede it 18 years i ?
it is obvious that the work on elective post is not the predictable program of actions in so far as our public dialog will be formed by the opposition political party and such accidental events as the slaughter in njyutaune .
nevertheless on all more listed by me above example visible , that they were their own choice of the administration to a considerable degree .
also this is what worries me most of all .
i voted for obamu again in 2012 , but not therefore , that i was full of enthusiasm concerning his candidacy .
mitt romni was an incomprehensible and rough alternative , it seemed that it is not in the state to make the decision on its own policy or looks .
i thought that within his second period obama after liberating itself from the pressure of the future elections it will justify the hopes which we have heard about for such a long time .
however , when this week the appraisement obamy fell beneath 45 % , to return to 2008 by means of this book became much more difficult .
this forces me to miss many promises which vanished .
this week i read that part of the book in which is making a slip , as clinton obame inflicted a deafening defeat on the primary elections in pennsylvania .
at the meeting on the analysis of the causes of failure he told his co-workers that they have to return to a normal course and to remain true to their goal .
« i want , that we returned our attractiveness , he said .
— we have to recall the one who they are » .
five years , mr president , passed also i am absolutely agreeing with you .
the opinions which were expressed in this comment come exceptionally from nataniehlyu morrisu .
in egypt the first freely elected president is taking on an oath
mohammed mursi is scarcely receiving the oath , but a day of his ceremony the end of the political fight in egypt will express himself
islamist mohammed mursi promised « new egypt » after after i / you / he was bringing the oath becoming the first one freely elected by the president of the country after changing mubarak &apos;s xosni which was overthrown 16 months ago .
on its inauguration before the supreme constitutional court mursi also became the first freely elected islamist president of the arabic peace and the fifth head of the state in egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago .
he took on the oath in front of 18 judges in the black mantles in the building of the court in the shore of nile built in the style of the ancient egyptian temple .
« we are striving for better future , new egypt and the second republic » , said mursi during the solemnity shown in a direct ether on state television .
« today the egyptian people imparted the principles of new life is absolute freedom genuine democracy and stability » , mursi declared , the 60-year-old engineer with american education from « bratjev-musuljman » , fundamentalist group , which big part from 84 years of his existence was be suppressed by the organization , serv as the target for the hard activities of the governments which changed each other .
hundreds of the soldiers and the police officers guarded the building , when mursi arrived with the small motorcade soon after 11 the morning according to local time .
only a little hundred supporters got together near the building of the court in order to greet the new president , and , in contrast to the presidential pump of mubarak &apos;s times , the movement has been stopped only for a short time in order to let in his motorcade along the normally revived road which connects a downtown to the southern suburbs .
although they laughed at mursi like « the brothers &apos; » uncharismatic « spare wheel » , his personal prestige sharply grew from the moment of his victory and friday talk in which he tried to introduce himself as candidate not only the islamists , but also all those who want to carry out the matter of the rebellion of 2011 against the authoritarian mubarak to an end .
« today egypt is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state » , told mursi dressed in the blue business suit with the red tie to the judges in the hall sewn for by the wooden panels , where he took on the oath .
went later than mursi to the kairskiij university , where he had to deliver his inauguracionnuyu speech .
the official receipt with the army orchestra carrying out the state anthem during which it was on the counter « quietly » was given him .
attended the war official field marshal hussein tantavi .
« the » motto « army and people » was met with his arrival « is one arm which hundreds of accumulated declaimed in the main lecture hall of the university .
the university founded in 1908 as the stronghold of the secular education , kairskiij in 1970 became the stronghold of the islamist student groups .
the president &apos;s power mursi took to return the symbolic oath on friday in the area taxrir , where the rebellion that completed the authoritarian management of mubarak last year arose , and promised , which his post are deprived with the council of war that took over the matters from the overthrown leader .
but after agreeing to take on the official oath before the court , and not in front of the parliament as this is usual , he is fulfilling the soldiers &apos; will , and this is the sign that the struggle for authority will be going on .
the speech mursi in the area taxrir was filled with populistskimi theater gestures .
the schools called to pay more attention to mathematics , orthography and grammar
the school courses will demand the english literature so that the pupils would study at least one shakespeare &apos;s play , the novel of the 19th century , the romantic poetry and the modern british fiction starting in 1914 .
on examination « the extraprogram texts » will also be presented so that to encourage the vaster reading .
the united course of english literature and language will be canceled .
since 2015 the pupils will be obliged to take the separate final examination , with the insistent recommendations of the choice of the english literature as separate examination , on language
the department of the education has to publish the new curricula on the english tomorrow and mathematics — the first objects subjected to the radical revision .
it will make changes into the other main objects in the next year .
the regulating organ will separately present ofqual the reviewed structure of the final examinations of the high school in the sphere of examinations , with the new system of the evaluations and the smaller amount of the term papers .
appearing as the summer , the minister of the education michael gouv said that « the wide consensus » was « attained in our having to reform our system of examinations , in order to return public trust » while drawing , that the school final examinations will be « more complicated , more ambitious and stricter » .
the researches show that the english schools have spared less time for mathematics ( 116 hours per year , or three hours per week during quarter ) than in the majority of the countries .
for the comparison is the australian schools have given on average 143 hours into a year , and in singapore the pupils are studying about 138 o &apos;clock .
although there will be no formal demand to spare more time for mathematics in the time table , the sources in coalition said that large-scale school final examinations on mathematics are in combination with the greater coefficient in the table of the appraisements , most probably this object will serve as a stimulus for the granting by the schools of an additional teaching
in educational plan more attention will be paid « to tasks from real life » , including financial mathematics .

gennady syuganov offered to bring the criminal responsibility for &quot; appeals to the partition of russia &quot; : &quot; if to say in the usa on radio that it is necessary to give alaska of russia 20 years of the prison have been arresting you and will give &quot; !
vladimir shirinovsky was trying &quot; not to light &quot; really .
he accused the journalists who are putting forth sick and critical national problems to the public discussion of all , as usual : &quot; in the heat of polemics &quot; one can &quot; say &quot; anything &quot; &quot; !
the &quot; single russia &quot; leader of the parliamentary group after all vladimir vasilev advised the journalists here to conclude &quot; a charter &quot; and to make arrangements to lead the conversations to this topic carefully , and then they can undertake the same obligations and policy .
with us about 30 laws which regulate a migration are accepted , and the order is established as a whole , declared mr vasilev .
as an example it listed the law which puts the responsibility for international peace on the regional and municipal authorities in their territory .
but ludmila andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm concerning this law : there are &quot; no precise conceptions about what is the migrants &apos; adjustment , about her mechanisms and limits &quot; in it
this means the subjects will interpret the amount of this power differently .
moreover some municipal administrations do not have personnel , so complicated questions , necessary for decision , there are resources , and methodical recommendations which they could have used , the center is not giving to them ...

the acknowledgments of the agency of the national security strengthen the paranoia of the corporations with regard to the state shadowing
warm the helicopter of the german police flew august over the consulate of the usa low in frankfurt , the financial capital of germany , during the day at the end conclusion .
on the instructions of the federal service of the defense of the constitution ( bfv ) , the service of the inner secret service to germany , was his job to photograph the roof of the building of the representation of the usa , which is less like what in 5 km from the european central bank and bundesbanka .
the german mass media say that bfv hoped to discover the antennae of the eavesdropping devices , and these actions entailed the negotiations between the usa and the ministry of foreign affairs department of germany in berlin .
james klehpper , the director of the national secret service of the usa , certified in september again that the usa is not using the possibility of the foreign secret service « for the theft of the trade secrets of the foreign companies in the interest of american companies , in order to improve their international competitiveness or increase their profit » .
but ever since ehdvard snouden — the contract employee that became razoblachitelem — began to publish his treasury of the secrets the secret services of the usa , the european governments and the heads of the companies are not convinced whether the director on word may believe any more .
the suppliers of the cloudy sets of the usa have the messages about the national agency of the security of the usa being following a brazilian oil company petrobras and receiving access to data to those being kept , including google and yahoo , they picked up the paranoia of the corporations called , to the new heights , by the shadowing of the state .
a news about that became the last drop , what was listened the chancellor &apos;s telephone the angels merkelj , about ten years are possible .
of course , if the most influential persona of europe becomes can a target , also the leaders of business are potential targets .
snouden made evident the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the usa and companies .
i think , it is completely probably that these data are being used with mutual advantage .
« germany has to wake up » , is saying oliver gryun , the president of the unification bitmi who introduces the small and middle it-companies of germany .
the german companies are convinced that the usa is presenting now almost the same risk as china , in the field of industrial espionage and the theft of the data , according to the research published by the consulting agency ey in july .
nevertheless , there were no evidences of the usa passing on the trade secrets of the foreign companies to their own companies in all the documents opened by mr snoudenom up to now .
the politicians expressed uneasiness in the eu not grabbing certain possibilities in the field of information technologies and internet , and the opinion that he should try to diminish its dependence from the usa .
the business persons sceptically belong to this .
somebody says in the parliament of germany that we have to create the german for google .
i can shut my eyes only and open them slowly again …
« this is not version » , is saying gasso plattner , the president of the german company-supplier of the software for business sap .
if there is necessity of powerful european it-industry , it was not it to allow her to die more than 20 years ago worth .
everything is being subsidized in germany : from coal before the cars and the farmers .
all , besides it industry .
and nevertheless coverage and the technical development of the agencies for espionage of the usa becoming well known thanks to revelations snoudena were the shock for some companies which thought earlier that the biggest risk of shadowing introduces china .
the big shift is going on in cloudy technologies where the heads of the european companies better realized that the data that are kept in the usa are in the same jurisdiction and therefore vulnerable .
according to the research conducted by the trade association cloud security alliance , about 10 percent of her un-american participants refused from the plans to use the services of the cloudy provider being in the usa after the exposure of the american program for the intellectual present prism analysis .
dzhim sneijb , one of the executive directors sap , said : « we see that the consumers are asking the new question which did not arise a year ago but namely : where my data are kept and you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction » .
many german leaders assert that the last messages are only the confirmation of what they have already known : the moguqestvennye states want to steal away their most valuable secrets , and , therefore , these data should be protected at any price .
that that an industrial espionage is going on — it is unsurprising .
it has always taken place .
this was the object of the discussion many years and substantially did not change in current « polemics » , kurt is speaking the side , the executive head director of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level , and we are also spying on them because our national interests include this : to defend our commercial businesses .
the leaders of the corporations do not love normally bragging about those counter measures which they undertook because this can grant the enemy advantage .
in big companies the thought has been acquired for a long time , to take free flewku at the exhibition or to leave a notebook without a care in the number of the hotel is this , at least , thoughtlessly .
uljrix xakenberg , is member the board of directors of the motor-car company audi , he is speaking , what already many years this standard practice one to gather the car telephones before the sessions of the management so that they would not be able to be employed as an eavesdropping device .
the federal service of the defense of the constitution of germany is advising the heads of the companies to discuss the possibility of the use of the simple car telephones prepaid for during the foreign trips due to the vulnerability of the smartfonov .
the car telephones prepaid for are subsequently jumping .
nevertheless there are the fears that the small and middle companies remain vulnerable for the breakings and the shadowing .
in germany many similar companies are leaders on the world market of their concrete niche .
an experience co-workers and financial resources do often not suffice for small and middle companies in order efficiently to defend the corporate secrets against unauthorized access » he is giving advance notice in the report of bfv .
the usa is giving advance notice to its own companies of an industrial espionage on the side of other countries .
the national reconnaissance summary of the usa in february put france together with russia and israel into the second row of the trespassers who are dealing with hacking for economic secret service , after china , is confirming the washington post .
member the board of directors of the prestigious german company confirmed , that when the talk is about an industrial espionage , the frenchmen are the worst .
bernard skarsini , the former head of the french agency of the inner secret service dcri , declared as he is being informed , in the interview this month : « the services excellently know that all the countries even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism are spying on their allies » .
the international airport of los angeles was evacuated due to the shooting in one from the terminals .
the unknown man opened fire in the third terminal into 09.30 according to local time on friday , on 1st november ( 20.30 msk ) .

tripodi denies , that i / you / he is prone to influence obeijda
the former labor secretary of new south wales dzho tripodi will be a figurant of the investigation into the antikorrupcionnogo supervision organ of this staff
the former minister of new south wales dzho tripodi is refuting the introduction of changes into the order of the rent of the coastal objects at the request of his political instructor of ehddi obeijda secretly owning the shares in three objects of real estate on state earth
the independent commission enlarged its investigation into of that against corruption ( icac ) on friday , mr obeijd lobbied curie with a few ministers of the staff the prolongation leasing contracts on serkjyular , there are their actions where two restaurants and a coffee bar belong to family obeijdov , without passage of the tender after the expiration in august 2005 .
it now investigates the assertions about what mr tripodi knew about the secret participation of mr obeijda in the objects of real estate , after evidences given by the former deputy of the head of the administration of mr tripodi linn ehwpoul on thursday .
for a few years of the discussions which began in 2005 the government has been insisting on the rent being put forward on the open contest .
the tenants were against this , as well as wanted longer tenancies .
in 2009 the leasing contracts of the businesses were prolonged without showing on the open contest on serkjyular of curie who brought 2.5 million in a year to family obeijdov close to $ .
g-n tripodi who was the minister of infrastructure and transport since february 2006 until november 2009 , was in favor of the open contests initially .
but he denied that the changes were made at the request of mr obeijda who as mr tripodi recognized i / you / he insistently advised to bring in changes into the lease policy of the government .
in the decoding of the telephone conversations presented by icac the conversations were listed in august and september 2007 among mr obeijdom , mr tripodi i stivom dannom , the older official , which came to the ministry of the ports after the work under leadership of mr obeijda in the department of fishery .
« a question that was being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations was the question of the development of the policy of commercial rent » ? — the assistant of ehntoni uili commissioner asked mr tripodi .

« i hope that the president will listen to us , and we are turning to it with the request to turn this bill down and to return it to the deputies » , he said .
in essence , according to newspaper the star , the new law will allow government take mass media with stranglehold » , but the standard announced that democracy and the freedom of speech in kenya « received the serious blow » , and castigated a bill how « draconian » .
the acceptance of the bill is the part of the measures undertaken for the intensification of the national security after the september attack of the moslem terrorists in the trade center westgate .
the kenyan mass media caused the anger of the authorities transmitting the recordings of the cameras tubes of the observation , where troops are which were sent to the place of attack , are hypothetically robbing the expensive trade center .
a call of two journalists and official of mass media on the interrogation became the reaction of david kimaijo chief of police although the call was reversed by the mass media after mass protests .

the politicians understand what they will be able to do after forcing the mass media to become silent they all , that he vzdumaetsya to them with impunity .
« no one will ever know » , wrote journalist nation mutuma mehtjyu describing the kenyan mass media as the key source of the forces holding back and balancing in public life .
« the politicians that were granted themselves to themselves will destroy a country and will bring us back to hunting and a collecting » , he wrote .
the kenyan legislators have been a target of the public anger also in the past .

the investigators are checking the information about abuse of the child in biijske
on 29th october the mass media published the message about the educator of one of the nursery schools of the town biijska locking in the child in the basement in educational goals .
at present investigators turn out all the circumstances , as well as the legal evaluation comes the actions of the co-workers of the nursery school .
after the accusation of durnovkusii i / you / she bored eugene vasilev
eugene vasilev is , to the persona of which the fixed attention of the mass media is chained hardly a year , i / you / she has up to now never commented numerous publications in press both about the thefts in ministry of defense and about it personally relationships with the ex-minister of the defense anatoli serdyukovym , her poetry also about passion to expensive things .
however figurantka of matter &quot; oboronservisa &quot; broke silence on 1st november .
in life news vasilev &apos;s interview i / you / she declared : of course , the task was originally exactly one : you have to drag just any negative information with regard to the former defense secretary &quot; out of me &quot; .
a blackmail concerning my having to give the evidences was , they will put otherwise than i in the prison .
currently these threats stopped .
we are further going to the court , will prove our innocence .
we are convinced of the victory of 100 percent .
at the same time one can come to the conclusion from an interview , words about a that with it is unimportant tastefully touched which , maybe , is a lot of to vasilev .
it is probable , there is the statement of the official representative of the sk of the russian federation vladimir markina about what is in the collection of the pictures in a look which figurantka gathered the matters &quot; oboronservisa &quot; , the forgings appeared .
there are the properties the row of the pictures which the proprietress bought being convinced of her deep cognitions of the art like the masterpieces of the world painting among the prisoner .
however the art history expertise appointed investigators after the arrest of these pictures determined that they do not have any artistic value and are cheap forgings plainly speaking &quot; noted markin at the beginning of october .
some pictures stolen away from ministry of defense ...
all the same then they recognized that they are not stolen away from the ministry of defense , at the same time they said a that with me is bad tastefully .
who has the right to discuss my taste , to discuss some personal moments ?
in my opinion , this simple chaos &quot; , - speaks vasilev .
at the same time i / you / she declared vasilev on the question whether she will recognize her guilt at least in one of the 12 criminal episodes being regarded by it &quot; naturally , it &quot; no not no .
in general , there is nothing to recognize
furthermore , there is no damage of the russian federation which a talk is about .
they simply introduce the people into delusion , there is everything .
moreover , in reply to the today &apos;s statement of the sk of the russian federation , what avoids vasilev from the research of the materials of the criminal case , the lawyer of figurantki declared that &quot; the investigator is not letting &quot; her and his customer &quot; meet the materials of the matter &quot; .
what served as a cause to revelations of that being under a house arrest vasiljevoij not associating with the press up to now ?
as the woman did she feel obliged to answer the accusation of bad taste , possibly ?
or after all journalists &quot; komsomolki &quot; are right , asserting a couple of days ago , that it &quot; fell into still greater trans is under a house arrest &quot; due to the news about anatoli serdyukova with the wife &apos;s reconciliation and his return into the bosom of the family ?
the well known war correspondent of &quot; the kp &quot; victor the chicory in its article &quot; serdyukov returned to the wife &quot; ? i / you / he wrote : &quot; the investigators do not exclude that after such a shock it becomes can more talkative on the interrogations &quot; .
i / you / she undertook earlier than vasilev some accusations of the illegal sale of the immovable of ministry of defense .

today the donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with potable water and to install biotoilets

from here the loads are going to stavropol territory of russia , kazakhstan , georgia , armenia .
on sunday until the midnight already they let go , and brought these rules later : a truck driver alexei golovanev ( on the photo ) is complaining who is carrying as transit goods to kazakhstan across load russia from turkey and has already spent the night in his car hardly a week .
according to new rules in order to cross the border i need an additional package of the documents also the payment of the insurance of the load .

the minimum insurance is 4,5 − 5 of thousands of roubles ( close to 1100 − 1300 of grivnas ) .
those , who is going nearby ( will say to georgia , armenia ) with the load with a cost up to 50 000 dollars , they are paying 15 000 roubles ( 3800 grivnas ) somewhere and pass .
and the remaining ones stuck - but no one has such big money with themselves !
you present , if the driver is carrying load to the amount of whole four thousand dollars , but quite to moscow , he should pay 90 000 roubles ( hardly 23 000 grivnas ) for a transit !
conditions for the survival on the border - any , - truck drivers are complaining , those establishing itself are directly by their cars
in the shops close to the border and the coffee bar anyhow it is expensive always , but we did not meet such prices as here , anywhere !
the sellers oriented themselves and excited them fast : 15 grivnas a white bread costs , seven grivnas a glass of coffee , 25 grivnas is - the plate of the soup .
and kafewka is one .
also the toilet is not here
in the steppe we are sleeping , we are going to the same place into the toilet .
neither you have to wash yourself , nor you have to shave ...
i am not able to get out of the car also a week , for me the wife into the road prepared all .
i will last a week : another truck driver victor skotarenko is comforting himself .
will the line only reach my car in a week ?
how much do you have one and a half liters of water ? - we are interested in only magazinchike close to the border .
you have to eat grivnas in 11 and in 15 .
that crystal bottle or water insisted is on silver ?
we have a coffee bar , and not a shop .
take while something is still : a saleswoman is parrying .
after they began to clarify the situation in some mass media , they turned the attention of the authority of the region to the distress of the ukrainian drivers .
the instruction of amvrosievskoij and novoazovskoij of district state administration received the instruction to provide everyone who are standing in line on the ukrainian-russian border with potable water , declared acting the chairperson of donetsk oblgosadministracii sergei dergunov .

how many earn late renowns - mk in the usa of the mk
a madonna who earned 125 million dollars became head of the appraisement of the lively renowns with the highest income in 2013 .
but the late michael dzhekson whose posthumous income has put together 160 million from october of 2012 until october 2013 , &quot; pereplyunul &quot; it
the other renowns who left life who &quot; earned &quot; several times less last year appreciably are losing touch with it

ehser is offering to equate the insult of the patriotic feelings with extremism
for the legislative defense of the patriotic feelings of citizens from the provocations that were directed against russia and &quot; fair russia &quot; insults offers to equate the insult of the patriotic feelings towards extremist activity also to punish behind this five years the prisons .
as the newspaper &quot; izvestias &quot; is announcing , such corrections into legislation prepared by the vice-chair of the duma energy committee oleg mixeevym have already been directed into the supreme court and a government for the receipt of the conclusion .
hearth the author of the corrections offers with patriotic feelings of citizens to understand the person &apos;s emotional connection with the country the citizen of which it is being characterized by love for this country , responsible attitude toward her fate , respect for her history and culture .
there are sanctions for offense above the formal signs of the state authority - the flag and the coat-of-arms , as mixeev points out , in domestic legislation .
at the same time , according to the parliamentarian , the defense of the russians whose feelings can be touched by both the insult of the state symbols and the other manifestations of the disrespect for our country is worked over in russian legislation insufficiently .
as an example it is bringing the victories of discussion developing annually into the eve of the day when some mediijnye personas are allowing themselves to call the heroic feat of the people of the ussr into doubt in the fight against the fascists .
on the eve of the main national holiday - a day of the victory on 9th may - annually the real bacchanalia develop .
practicing wit and &quot; an alternative view &quot; on history , some publicists are coming to the reasonings about that , what supposedly , as it is regrettable that the cultural germans did not conquer the wild soviet union !
i consider such a absolutely inadmissible in the country , where the pride in history is staying main &quot; spiritual skrepoij &quot; nations &quot; , oleg mixeev is outraged .
in words mixeeva , patriotically , moreover , the incited people are in russia much more , like what religious , however at the same time the law punishes for the insult of the feelings of believers , and one can offend the patriotic feelings practically with impunity .
according to the people &apos;s elected representative , it is necessary to equate the insult of the patriotic feelings towards extremist activity and it to prescribe in the 282nd article of the penal code appropriate punishment .
the bill provides for the punishment for the insult of the patriotic feelings : from 100-thousandth penalty up to 5 - summer conclusion .

today the counsel of the public chamber ( op ) can confirm the new ranks of public observation commissions ( onk ) in 43 regions of russia .
if the version which was put on a vote has been taken on , the workers &apos; lobbyists will increase their influence .
onk is the public structures which check the conditions of the storage in the places of imprisonment .
the matters of sergei magnitskogo and leonid razvozzhaeva , the excitements in the kopeijskoij colony - namely across onk majorities of the resonance incidents behind the bars are receiving a publicity .
around the control of onk the fight is walking among the human rights activists and the workers &apos; lobbyists .
on the session of a work group of the op on formation onk i offered to make the experiment of the human right activity the criterion of selection .
&quot; they did not receive it and formed lists without having made criteria &quot; : valery borqev is saying .
borqev - the present chairperson of moscow observation commission and the association of the independent observers - of the human rights activists &apos; russian structure , is be dealing with prison problems .
into the deputy of duma from &quot; the apple &quot; days he developed the law that regulates the activity onk .
the counsel of op has to vote for some onk compositions in 43 regions of the country .
less than a thousand interested persons are aspiring to 1800 vacant places , but in ingushetia and kabardino-balkaria the contests were not able to organize the candidates due to absence .
op promises to organize the pretypesetting on vacant places .
onk of moscow is one of few commissions with contest , in spite of the fact that instead of 20 40 participants will be in a new composition .
on given by borqeva , in the present ranks of metropolitan commission of 11 human rights activists and 9 workers , and in the version which is on the vote in op relation is changing on 17 to 23 .
at the same time into metropolitan commission wanted to hit 30 human rights activists
but the representative of &quot; the combat brotherhood &quot; vyacheslav kalinin can join a new composition repeatedly .
it has been member of onk for three years , but has never visited the prisoners .
borqev thinks that the workers will be able to make the human rights activists &apos; work unbearable after appointing their chairperson onk , therefore the human rights activists do not exclude a collective exit from a commission .
in their opinion , member onk anthony tsvetkov is coordinating the workers &apos; advancement , heading &quot; the officers of russia &quot; - the organization that is asserting the interests of the power departments .
&quot; i do not eat &quot; am &quot; the babies on zav ­ trak &quot; , rbk daily anthony tsvetkov declared .
he denies that he is lobbying the advancement of some lists and says that it is not preparing to prevent the human rights activists from visiting the arrested members of the opposition .

the publication borqevym information it thinks with the form of pressure .
the human rights activists &apos; possible success - the planning change of the instruction of chelyabinsk onk .
they will push aside her former leaders due to previous year kopeijskix excitements .
in the public chamber they came to the conclusion that the leadership of local commission ignored the prisoners &apos; problems .
and here onk of rostov-on-don can go from the human rights activists to the workers .
from the new lists a human rights activist chairperson of local commission &quot; disappeared &quot; , but one of his opponents turned up , in spite of the fact that in may 2013 , the federal public chamber excluded it for unethical behavior .
the lists of moscow and rostov commissions borqev considers &quot; a revenge for kopeysk &quot; .
nadezhda tolokonnikovoij exposures did not influence onk of mordovia which they consider to be &quot; power &quot; : into new composition only one right defender wanted to hit , and did even not take the documents for contest with it
nicholas svanidze told rbk daily the councilman of op that i / you / he voted against the offered list because the situation in moscow and rostov-on-don stirs it up .
it distributed his position to other councilmen .
his co-worker according to op paul gusev is speaking , that i / you / he was voting behind , because he likes the offered moscow list .
the deputy of the secretary of op vladislav grib being also a co-worker of the research institute fsin coordinated the composition of the lists onk .
the mushroom told rbk daily about his not considering it right to divide the candidates by the human rights activists and the workers and not agreeing with the chairpersons of the commissions having enough power in order to hinder work it the members .

klaijv palmer asserts that deputy tony ehbbota has a conflict of interests in the question of the vacation to the care of the child .
the deputy-billionaire klaijv palmer says that prime minister tony ehbbota has a conflict of interests in the question of the vacation to the care of the child , because his daughters can get pregnant and extract advantage from this .
this tycoon of the mining branch who has the unregulated dispute because of the payment of the the ejections of the carbon at the rate of 6 $ of the millions tax did this statement at that time , when he was trying to brush aside the questions whether it has a conflict .
the united party palmera can check up to four voice in the senate which can have the deciding importance in the decision making about the abolition of the the ejections of carbon taxes and the mining activity .
but mr palmer asserted that only the ministers could have the conflict of interests , and said that the daughters of mr ehbbota personally will turn up in a win from political measures .
« it has a big conflict of interests when the talk is about the vacation on the care of the child being paid for because if any of these daughters will get , that there will be with it mr palmer said « the direct interest in if they will receive the vacation or not » .
two months after elections the electoral commission officially declared mr palmera a winner in the struggle for place from sanwaijn-kost of electoral district of fehrfaks with the advantage of 53 voices after recounting of voices .
g-n palmer was calling to the revision of the procedure of the calculation of voices on elections for the acceleration of this process .
the daughters tony ehbbota frehnsis and bridzhit .

« we should have the more complete system » , he said .
why we do not have to have this such a system so that one could come to bring its data into the computer one to vote immediately and to receive result as a 18 : 30 the same evening ?
g-n palmer also subjected the use of the pencils for the marks in the bulletins papers to the critique .
this because they can obliterate result if somebody will not like it
to use a pencil seems nowadays strange .
the electoral commission is dealing with the research of the possibilities of electronic vote and published the joint discussion document with new zealand recently .
59-year-old mr palmer said that his program includes the international airport for sanwaijn-kost and will « very seriously » relate to his new work .
the state post supposes a service society .
« we are not attempting any rewards , besides the gratitude of history , behind at critical moment our being able to serve this district he said .

they specially photographed the snowboarder for the olympic bank note
bank of russia put the memory banknote dedicated to the town of sochi , where the olympic games will already this winter turn out , in circulation on wednesday .
the face value of the bank note is 100 roubles .
but in the net of blogery they have actively already mocked at the memory banknote .
after the presentation of the olympic bank note on 30th october they turned attention to one being able to find the representation of the snowboarder from the banknote in fotobankax .
in particular is 2005 in the free storehouse of the photo of stockexchange , where the present photograph is dated .
the the same photograph is being used for photoshop lesson , published on the russian site &quot; megareview &quot; of january 18 , 2011 .
moreover , they have already employed it for the advertisement of the smartfonov of ruggear .
the olympic banknote is fulfilled in the blue-light blue gamut .
on the one hand the snowboarder who is flying above sochi , from another - the type of olympic stadium and heat-bird is portrayed .
the author of the design of the banknote is paul buwuev who defeated repin in the contest among the students of saint petersburg academy of arts of the name .
on the presentation it was being noted that a few forms of sports were being discussed is the ski jump , fristaijl and jumps from the springboard , but as a result they chose the snowboard in so far as this is a relatively young form of sports .
according to the source of &quot; izvestias &quot; , the izvestia which is close to the central bank , the regulator a public about the wide popularity of the representation of the snowboarder from the olympic banknote does not feel indifferent to an opinion and now they are studying a situation .
but here in goznake are not too worried about wumixoij around the olympic banknote .
the head of the news service of the state sign nikiforov &apos;s natalia declared &quot; izvestias &quot; that all the reasonings about the plagiarism are funny .
i / you / she specified , the snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right , there is on the photographs in net to the left , nikiforov .
the person left different points on fotosessii for the creation of the bank note , then the final representation was chosen , there is the snowboarder &apos;s characteristic pose in it
she also noted that the laws on copyright are not concerning the olympic banknote because the artist received the wages for work .
according to the experts , the discussion is on the olympic bank note around the representation and quite positive .
uznavaemostj of representation on the bank note is plus for her advancement , thinks the executive director np &quot; rusbrend &quot; alexei popovichev .
proving the hundred-percent likeness of the representations on the bank note and in fotobankax is quite complicated , therefore the claims will scarcely come under the contestation of the intellectual property to the present representation .
the olympic banknote appeared in china for the first time - to the olympic games in beijing in 2008 the memory banknote was released onto the 10 yuans .
russia decided to maintain this tradition .

they deprived the agency &quot; rosbalt &quot; of status of the mass media because of obscene scolding
he is writing , on 31st october mosgorsud decided to declare the license invalid about the registration of the agency &quot; rosbalt &quot; , &quot; the tape &quot; .
roskomnadzor insisted on the deprivation of the agency of the status of mass media - for systematic and rough law-breakings about mass media .
in the course of the process the unpleasant precedent was created : the court considered closing the mass media possible , there is actually the edition counterarguments after refusing in the right to propose .
what are &quot; rosbalt &quot;
zao &quot; press agency rosbalt &quot; was established in st petersburg in 2000 .
into the following years the agency opened the second head office in moscow and the series of the regional subdivisions .
also at agency representations are working in the countries of the former ussr .
since 2001 &quot; rosbalt &quot; has been developing and functioned as federal information-analytical agency .
to the middle the 2000th agency entered into the list of the quotients of the internet mass media in russia most being recognized .
at the same time &quot; rosbalt &quot; has always taken up a quite specific niche : notes with reference to the sources were the kernel of the exclusive publications of the agency ( also put together up to now ) in law-enforcement agencies .
the conversations about the proximity of the edition to power structures were going on during the whole extent of the existence of the agency .
together with &quot; rosbalt &quot; possessing the vast base of the sources in different departments for the benefit of such suppositions also that spoke , that at the head of a project natalia chaplina was - victor cherkesova wife .
at the same time role is not clear to the chaplinoij one in instruction of &quot; rosbaltom &quot; until the end : they mostly call it &quot; a project leader &quot; .
afonina larissa is the general manager of the agency , the editor in chief - nicholas ulyanov .
recently &quot; rosbalt &quot; did not appear in the appraisements of the federal mass media - neither on citiruemosti , nor on auditory .
in october the agency occupied the 25th place in the appraisement of the attendance of the sites of russian mass media of the version of liveinternet .
according to the data of same liveinternet , the average daily auditory of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 000 unique visitors ( also up to 500 000 oversights ) , about three million unique visitors are monthly .
among the most popular materials in the last five months notes are groups &quot; king and fool &quot; about the helplessness of the kremlin in relationships with ukraine , the soloist &apos;s death , the pogroms in metropolitan biryuleve .
the conflict of &quot; rosbalta &quot; with roskomnadzorom began in july 2013 , after the corrections of the law against the mass media which prohibited the journalists from obscene scolding came into effect .
the department discovered the suppressed vocabulary in two videorolikax published on the site of the agency ( &quot; the circus rider from krasnodar &quot; and &quot; pussy riot defiled oil towers &quot; ) .
the sides are describing the further thing differently .
roskomnadzor according to discovered videomaterialov accused &quot; rosbalt &quot; of a rough and systematic law-breaking about mass media and turned to the court with the demand to take the license from an agency .
in &quot; rosbalte &quot; they were declaring that the claims of the department are illegitimate : first , the rollers were not editorial materials , secondly , the obscene words were camouflaged in them , and , thirdly , the rollers were removed from the site immediately after warning .
the representatives of the agency appealed against the claims roskomnadzora in the world court - when on october 22 , 2013 mosgorsud took on the claim to roskomnadzora , the consideration of these complaints has still also been continuing .
however already 25 numbers the justice of the peace took decision not into a use &quot; to rosbalta &quot; : they declared the editor in chief nicholas ulyanov guilty of the violation of the code about administrative infringements and punished of 20 000 roubles - for 10 000 behind every roller .
is evident , this also decided the issue of audition beforehand in mosgorsude : if to refuse the thought that the issue even earlier might have been decided beforehand .
on 31st october the court made the decision to declare the evidence about registration &quot; rosbalta &quot; invalid after actually depriving the agency of status of mass media .
it is impossible to say that &quot; rosbalt &quot; remained in solitude in the course of this opposition .
the deputies of duma supported the agency ( 26 deputies added the statement to the name of the head roskomnadzora alexander zharov on 10th october ; the document itself was handed in on the initiative of kprf ) .
the head of the union of the journalists of russia vsevolod bogdanov , the chairperson of the journalists &apos; moscow union paul gusev and the head of the presidential counsel on human rights michael fedotov were reporting the illegality of the closing of the edition .
furthermore , according to bogdanov , the instruction of roskomnadzora even granted him some guarantees that it will not come to the comment of the license .
the trial against &quot; rosbaltom &quot; pointed under whose jurisdiction it is safer there to be the mass media in russia today - a big question .
the gene of the speech turned out to be a stimulator of the formation of the synapses
the scientists from the john &apos;s university of xopkinsa and the medical maunt sinaij school discovered their white , thanks to which &quot; a gene of the speech &quot; is foxp2 is carrying out his function stimulating the formation of the new connections between neurons .
the research is published in science , on the site of the magazine one can read his summary .
the gene foxp2 is the first well known gene the function of which is connected to a speech outright .
establishing his role was possible in 2001 thanks to the discovery of the family of a few people , did not understand who could not pronounce correctly the words and sometimes even himself each other .
the scientists cleared up the family members &apos; what the work of the gene foxp2 was disturbed remained however how he is fulfilling his function , in a not best known way .
in new research the biologists showed that the part of its functions foxp2 is fulfilling at least the formations of the new synapses like the stimulator in the field of the brain , the speech which was connected to a formation .
he thanks to another gene , srpx2 is carrying out this .
the last one was discovered as a result of the search of the factors which stimulate the formation of the synapses .
at the same time srpx2 turned out one of 10 similar genes found by the authors only on his activity viyaet foxp2 .
the that that srpx2 really influences vocalization , the scientists confirmed in the experiment on the baby mice .
when at the animals the activity of the gene was artificially reduced , they shouted less on separation with the mother .
if they restored the activity of the gene , also the frequency of the sounds to be published was being restored .
earlier on the mice the connection with vocalization foxp2 itself was also shown .
the animals like which they brought the human copy of the gene , the harquebus more actively also on lower frequency than the normal mice .
up to now , however , the scientists do not know whether the work of foxp2 and , correspondingly , controlled one as it is connected by srpx2 with the purely &quot; mechanical &quot; properties of the formation of the sounds or the more delicate processes .

do you want ice cream which is shining in darkness ?
the british businessman created first in the peace ice cream shining in darkness with the help of the medusa .
i / you / he employed charli frehnsis the fluorescentnye properties of the sea animal , in order to work out the shining food
he came to this idea after reading the scientific article about the medusas , and convinced the scientists chemically to recreate his shining white in china .
ice cream enters a reaction improving the level of a ph in the white with the language of the one who is eating it and forcing it to shine .
kris is speaking , what in so far as ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth this means , what the more you are licking , it is becoming that more brightly .
charli , the founder of the the production of the ice cream company &quot; lick me , i tasty &quot; , speaks : « this is improbable thing , but therefore if to talk about production you will still on the most initial stage receive the substances for £ 200 about 2 g » .
the white which we are using for the ice cream enters a reaction with your language under neutral ph .
therefore , after your mouth will warm the white , this will improve the level of a ph and ice cream will begin to shine .
we have tested it for a few last months , and seemed , that it will be ideal to introduce it in xehllouin because it is creating such a fabulous shining effect .
this , possible , the most expensive ice cream from those , which i did because the luminescence of the medusa is four times more expensive than gold .
so every ball costs to me close to £ 140 .
but it is quite pleasant on taste .
the experimental company charli put in bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including the beer , cheese , beef taste and the taste of the tinsel gold .
but his next creation has to turn out to be even more ambitious .
he said : « i really want to work invisible ice cream out » .
this is impossible on definition due to the refraction which is caused by the crystals of ice which ice cream consists of , but i think that we will find the way to do this .
ice cream uses the fluorescentnye properties of the medusa synthesized by the chinese scientists

george kerevan : after digging with europe a choice gives to the scots
another day , yet another puppet about independence .
this time they are giving advance notice to us that independent scotland will have to join the european zone of the free transfer as the condition of the membership in the eu .
comes the trains of stories about the passport check in bervike and the border between barbed wire along adrianova of bank .
really , the newspaper strathclyde pointed out possible economic advantages of the freer transfers on remaining europe , although — what is predictable — this did not appear in the headings .
no one also pointed what the member countries of the ec have been wasting on that much time out in order not to turn its formal rules so , as it this is convenient .
in so far as scotland is not entering zone wengenskuyu now , the continuation of the inobservance of the demands will become cheap concession for brussels in place of that , which he really wanted from the scots .
so this is history not deserving attention .
also such old , that it turned into petrifaction : i heard the « duck » about « independence meaning a passport check » for the first time at least 40 years ago .
and nevertheless there is interesting moment lost on the exposition of the ancient tale .
why , in general , does independent scotland have to carry out the orders of europe ?
why should we change the yoke of london for the yoke of brussels , especially now ?
here is the present european news : the great post-war plan to unite europe at last zastoporilsya .
with evrokrizisom the project « europe » is officially dead .
on the whole european union the parties , speakers are against the ec or for the abolition of a euro how the single currency , they are assembling power .
there is even the party of « alternative » evroskeptikov « for germany » in germany — founded only in this year — emerged from from nowhere and received almost five million voices on federal september elections , after in this way in essence forcing out « the free democrats » ( the counterpart of our « liberal democrats » ) from bundestag .
an inside opposition has always existed the plan of the creation of federal europe .
nevertheless the current depression became turning moment .
the measures of the hard saving brought by berlin and the european central bank , and the fetters laid on the national economies across the storage of the single currency led many people to the thought that the project « europe » came in too far .
the crisis is little connected by the euro to the fact that the national governments are working with the excessive deficits of the budget : this was fair only for greece .
as a matter of fact evrosistema blockaded its members on exchange rates , profitable for german exporters : that the german politicians also want to protect .
without possibility of the devaluation of the national currency southern europe turns out into beforehand handicap according to industrial possibilities in the comparison to germany .
the only salutary resource is to cut down on the wages and the public expenditures , which is actively being kept up by berlin .
a deeper problem of the productive proficiency of europe is behind the current problems of the budget and the currency .
as a result of the complex of the activities concerning « green » energy introduced by brussels — the code which means the subsidization of the french and german energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the european industry pays for electricity and four times for gas twice as large than in the usa .
this paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions , as we have already seen in greijndzhmute .
no freezings of the wages will stop the crushing victory of the cheap schistose gas of the usa over european petrochemical industry in the peace
as a result the rebellion ripens , especially in france , once the most violent adherent of the eu .
after war the french political elite was considering the eu as the way to check germany and to put paris on one level with washington .
but berlin does not need paris any more as in the resource of the receipt of the political legitimacy , and has already imposed its own economic policy on europe after leaving the destroyed economy of france in distress .
result is right , the set of the seascapes le of foams « the national front » presenting against the ec won additional deciding elections after overthrowing the ruling socialist party on the third place just now .
« the front » is the most popular party in france with 24 percent of the voices — the timely warning for the british labourites about it not being allowed to proceed from the supposition that the split will automatically effect among the right ones for the benefit of the left ones , now .
what is making le foams with its new-found popularity among french white working class ?
she wants to use the elections to the eu in the next year in order to create a block in the european parliament against the ec and against the single currency .
if is but this is really probable — the parties that the were incited against the eu will receive the support on these elections , such a block will be able to take up for the first time the dominating position in the european parliament .
here is my opinion : soon the growing moods are against the ec and will merge together against the single currency in europe together in order to destroy a euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will become again something like indistinct « europe ( the sovereign ones ) » of the nations » which the general de gollyu liked .
germany and a few economies , зависимых from it can keep a euro , but france and southern europe will restore their own currencies .
i suppose that great britain is dissociating from this project hoping to become good friends with the usa .
nevertheless the growing interest of washington in the pacific points out the probability that great britain will stay without attention in the cold of the atlantic .
what position does this leave scotland in ?
we can choose the figure of england , small of the region ( in essence ) .
or we can defend our own economic interests , which means , apart from other , to send berlin and brussels to the devils .
i am suspecting , that scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a freer european agreement provided we will keep our currency .
the cooperation with other countries-like-minded person will be simpler in unfederal europe of the nations .
otherwise it is it to us to discuss the possibility of the repetition of the experiment of norway and the storage of our economic independence worth .
the government of the scottish national party is in scotland — for all that — be offered by the most successful political movement europe directed against the measures of the hard saving , receiving the impressive majority of the voices in 2011 thanks to objections to the reductions of expenses ( also realized ) the labourite chancellor of the exchequer alisterom darlingom and the coalition of tory and the liberal democrats which arose subsequently .
would be to scotland now absurdly to vote for independence in order that to take measures of the hard saving tied by berlin and brussels only .

early puberty : the age deterioration earlier
afroamerikanskie and the latin-american girls reach the sexual maturity , as a rule , earlier than their white contemporaries do , show researches .
the physical changes do not mean that the puberty is close
there are no evidences that the hormones or other chemical substances are guilty
the experts think that the epidemic of adiposity can be one of the starting mechanisms of the early puberty
tendency towards the early sexual maturity is not expressed so with the boys
the former correspondent cnn peht ehteridzh is a journalist who is specializing in children &apos;s health and questions of the family .
the mother should be scared if her daughter &apos;s germs of the mamma begin to be grown up and grow your lobkovye hair in 7 or 8 years ?
in the annual conference the doctor children &apos;s endocrinologist floor kaplovitc explained to the american academy of pediatrics that these early physical changes are quite spread among the american girls and are the new norm this week into orlando , staff of florida .
« i have been transporting much time calming down the parents — this does normally not mean the fast attack of the full sexual maturity » , said kaplovitc .
the evident signs of the development such as the growing breasts , are lobkovye both the axillary hair and the smell of the body , they appear earlier with the girls .
but was only the small displacement at the age menarxe ( the first menstruation ) during the last four decades .
in the united states the average age has been 12.5 years and came down in comparison with 12.75 in 1970 .
« after the breast begins to develop , at least two to three years pass before menarxe , is i / you / he said kaplovitc , also being the author of the book « the early puberty with the girls : how should we manage this widespread problem » .
the time is the that most exact check as the puberty will progress .
the discussion about what is the actual attack of the sexual maturity is being carried on , but it is considered « premature » when the increase of the breast is being accompanied by the burst of the growth up to 8 years .
in the majority of cases the process will become slower or will come to a halt — this is what the pediatrician can register attentively .
faster progressing can serve as a basis with the endocrinologist for the analyses in order to exclude the serious such as the tumors or the cysts problems .
there are procedures , in order to detain the menstruation also to avert another consequence early : the premature age deterioration of the bones which can ultimately lead to the slowing down of growth and short stature at a mature age .
the recommendations in medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , a stage of development , the rate of growth and emotional ripeness .
the psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplovitc is careful with the medicines , but recognizes that « the suppression of the puberty can soften the behavioral problems and the girls &apos; sensations that they are different from the contemporaries » .
another big problem is understandable : the parents do simply not want , that there were with their very young daughters menstruation .
« they worry about the risk of pregnancy or even about that how they will manage matters of hygiene » , said kaplovitc .
this was shock » , one woman remembers , with the daughter of which menstruation began at the age of 10 years .
although signs were and we talked about a menstruation , it was not ready emotionally .
it arrived by her being the first among her friends home from the school of scared and upset .
there are many advertised theories about the causes of the early puberty .
nevertheless there is no logical proof that the hormones are guilty of milt or other foodstuffs , the chemical substances in the environment or sexual posyly are in some mass media .
with the boys — as well as with the girl — the puberty is occurring earlier .
kaplovitc asserts that the prerequisite which has the largest weight is the epidemic of adiposity .
in 2001 it helped to conduct the research of the girls from 6 to 9 years which connects the quantity of fat in the organism to the periods of the puberty .
the other data are confirming this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country afroamerikanskie and latin-american girls reach the sexual maturity , as a rule , earlier than their white contemporaries do .
different explanations exist .
in the whole world everything is influencing an early puberty , in all probability : from economic conditions and climate before the genes .
still riddle : although the boys have the hair on the person and appears on lobke at a younger age , tendency towards the complete early puberty is not expressed so as with the girls .
other doctors who are participating in the conference aap confirmed the complexity of this topic .
the appearance of the pimples and the lobkovyx hair is met even with the babies and the children of day-nursery age .
« we have to be careful about that as we are determining the true attack of the sexual maturity » dr lourens siljverman , the children &apos;s endocrinologist , said in the children &apos;s hospital of gorieb to the town morristaun , the staff of new jersey .
the parents do not have to demur receiving the instructions from the pediatrician about that how to speak with its child .
this can mean the conversation earlier than was being expected , » explained kaplovitc .
if you are keeping calmness , your child will react well , as a rule .
needs a confirmation of the that of the girls who are flourishing early , what when this even occurs earlier more put , this process is the normal part of life .

rbs pushes aside two exchange traders
the royal bank of scotland temporarily pushed aside from two traders &apos; work in its subdivision on the foreign exchange operations , according to the information of two people , acquaintances with the present situation that it is yet another confirmation of the global testing of regulators of the manipulations on foreign exchange market being supposed precipitantly gathering the revolutions .
some of the biggest world bank , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs confirmed that they are cooperating with the regulators in the investigations connected to the financial market , biggest in the peace the daily turnover of which is $ 5.3 trillion .
these two traders will be first co-workers rbs pushed aside in the course of the developing investigation which has something in common with the scandal connected to the manipulations with interbank rate libor .
after refusing to comment the dismissals , the bank confirmed that this month it was receiving the inquiries about the granting of the information on the side of the regulating organs .
they announced , « our current investigation into this question is going on , and we are completely cooperating with fca and our other regulators » , in the bank two weeks ago .
last month the confidants said that rbs passed the regulating organ of great britain — department on the control of the financial activity ( fca ) the recordings of the e-mail and instantaneous messages which he was receiving and his former trader sent .
this trader , richard awer , left rbs in 2010 and as far as it is known the vacation is granted to him on his current post of the leader of the european spotovyx exchange trading in jpmorgan .
roxan ramchandani , the leader of the european spotovyx trading in citi , went on vacation as mehtt gardiner , the former older exchange trader in barclays and ubs this week , at that time , was removed from a work with a bank standard chartered this week .
there was not accused any of these traders of some violations .
a group of the contacts of the instantaneous messages of mr awera included the bankers from barclays and citigroup , according to the confidants .
the bank ubs announced this week that he took measures against his some co-workers after the swiss regulator finma had said that it is investigating the manipulations to be supposed on the foreign exchange market in the row of the swiss banks .
at least six regulating organs in the peace — european commission , finma , the anti-monopolistic organ of switzerland weko , fca , the ministry of justice of the usa and the exchange department of hong kong — are discussing the assertions about the bankers entering deal for influence upon foreign exchange market .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also began the inner checks or they received the inquiries about the granting of the organs attentively regulating the information , persons who are acquainted with situation said .
the banks are glancing through instantaneous messages and the e-mails in a few years in the search of the cases of infringements .
the news about the checks stirred the traders in the sphere of activities been one of the biggest sources of the earnings of the trade subdivisions of investment banks in the last years which , however , came up against difficulties in this year because the low volatility of the currencies reduces the favorable possibilities of the middlemen .
some bankers tried to diminish the seriousness of situation saying a vast and high-liquid foreign exchange market that it is practically impossible to manipulate , but the older traders say that this is not true always .
according to the older trader , despite the huge amount of the daily trading on foreign exchange market , the fragmentation of liquidity among different trade platforms and the wider use by the banks of its inside platforms means that « you can begin to exert the influence upon the market for quite small price » .
this news came which discharged one of the traders of its department of the fund trading of london stock exchange this week after that had caused the damages in the size of almost 6 million dollars at the end of past of the year on the same day , when the bank credit suisse declared .
the bank immediately informed the appropriate organs and is cooperating with its regulators .
« we are convinced , that the trader worked alone and what managed this question to localize : credit suisse announced .

in this year on peak fashions are sexual inanimate objects .
the women any more obligatory be the representatives of the sexual occupations ; they can also be a sexual food for example picceij , burgers or carrots .

they in singapore of the matter the owners of the pawnshops go well while the middle class feeling difficulties
in the pawnshop in the trade center bendemir in singapore dzhanani amirtxalinga is laying a golden bracelet , a ring and earrings in order to pay for the school teaching of its daughter .
my husband and i so all of my money are invested there » bought the house just now , is saying mrs amirtxalinga .
although it is also earning s $ 3000 ( 2400 $ ) in a month as administrator and it the husband is also working , the monthly income of the family is not enough , she is speaking .
there is , really , demand in the different parts of southeast asia that valuemax where she will see off her transaction became the third pawnshop registered at the stock market of singapore this week .
the credit on the guarantee of the jewelry products is not not simply fast way to receive money ( s $ 1300 in the event of mrs amirtxalinga ) , however , it is hardly just as cheap as unsupported bank credits .
the pawnshops are normally adding the effective annual interest rate of 17 % in singapore — above hardly 15.4 % which are offered in the department of united overseas bank , the local creditor with the branch in the same trade center .
however the pawnshops have that advantage that they are not demanding the solvency or proof of the wages check and more fast than the banks can deliver the credits .
therefore millions of the people in the whole region are turning to some pawnshops in so far as families feel the pressure due to the rise in the cost of living and the fast growth of the liabilities of households and consumer debts .
after five years of stable growth that followed a world financial crisis , and cheap credits that were being fed by the free policy of financial credit in the countries with developed by the economy families are turning with the low and average level of income to some pawnshops , in order to compensate for the decrease of the earnings according to the slowing down the growth of their economies .
this week standard &amp; poor &apos;s , rating agency , indicated the increase of the family credit shoulder , in a main thing due to the growth of mortgage , as the factor of the risk for the solvency of the asian banks .
he declared that malaysia , thailand and singapore had the highest relation of the debt of households to the gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia became head of this copy from 80 % from the gdp in comparison with 60 % in 2008 .
the economists are also troubled by the high level of consumer debt in thailand which hardly withdrew from a technical recession this week .
on thursday the data showed the reduction of the export going on and the weakening of the consumer demand .
« the essence in with the rise in prices the people looking in average and lower part &#91; the scales of earnings &#93; for the ways to replenish its earnings there is where only will be able » , song seng vun , economist cimb , of malaysian bank is speaking .
the high prices of gold strengthened rekordno in the last two years the haste from which the people have been imparting their personal things because they are using the opportunity to receive the money for its family decorations .
in singapore about 70 % of the things which are imparted in 200 pawn areas of the town-state are golden products .
the people are speaking : « the price of gold looks good , let &apos;s we will impart the grandmother &apos;s golden chain and we will get it back next month » .
in thailand the biggest operator of the pawnshops easymoney watched the stature of the number of the clients who are using his departments in the last months , right up to 20 % .
the growth in pawn business is such , what valuemax , the operator of the department is in bendemire and the 15 other same are in singapore , plan on also expanding not only in neighboring malaysia , where it has four shops , but also beyond the limits of asia , ijeax li ching , the executive director valuemax , is saying .
the company will finance an expansion , making use of 60 percent of s $ 66 of millions drawn this week as a result of the allocation of the actions in the stock market of singapore .
while some creditors caused the fire of the critique due to high interest rates , mrs ijeax says that the pawnshop offers the cheaper tariffs not only than other creditors , it is also not increasing the debt directly .
« the clients are imparting the objects which they have already owned , and monetizaciya of personal assets does not increase the liabilities of households » , she is saying .
pledge conquers always wider public acknowledgment as resource for the receipt of short-term , provided financing .
and at the same time not only those categories of the people who are in difficult financial situation are using the pawnshops .
the rich people are also using the delimitations by valuemax in singapore laying the golden ingots or hours rolex , which can give up to 60 percent from their buying price the ready money .
we see clients from all the layers of the society .
« they include the sound persons who need to borrow the money for the short period for commercial projects or capital investments , or the businesses of the small business , who need to overcome the temporary financial difficulties » mrs ijeax is speaking .
sometimes they simply need the money very fast .

a question about the stimulation of the criminal case rwaetsya , the older adviser of the movement in information and the public connections of southeast lu mvd of russia on transport sergei oljxovik announced .
nothing is new izvestias to the russian workers about &quot; brotherly circle &quot; grouping in a best known way
interfax.ru with reference to the informed source is writing about this in the law-enforcement agencies of the russian federation .
&quot; after into mass media the messages about the registration by the treasury department of the usa lepsa in the check lists on suspicion of accessories emerged to a evraziijskomu criminal syndicate &apos; brotherly circle &apos; , we glanced through all the data bases , but they &quot; did not &quot; discover &quot; such a grouping , an interlocutor of the agency said .
in his opinion , the propagation of the present information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about the so-called russian mafia which supposedly is active abroad .
as they wrote earlier &quot; not &quot; , yesterday the treasury department of the usa published &quot; a brotherly circle &quot; on its site of the members of criminal grouping being supposed the list .
among them also the russian singer gregory leps was named .
they laid out , it appears in the list as &quot; griwa &quot; , the day before .
they are coinciding with the data of the popular russian executor .
a precise name - gregory lepsevridze , a creative pseudonym , place and date of birth are named .
apart from lepsa , there another five people are mentioned .
two russians , the citizen of israel , the citizen of uzbekistan and yet another emigrant from the former ussr whose nationality is not indicated .
of the usa is assured , what transported gregory leps , who lives on the island pxuket for the gangsters the money on their order .
the singer &apos;s photograph is applied to a present message and all his data which correspond to reality are named .
furthermore , leps bought the house really recently on pxukete .
in department they noted that they are intending to impose the sanctions in relationship lepsa .
the person &apos;s entry into the black lists of the american ministry of finance entails the blockage of his assets to the usa and ban on business contacts with it the persons that live in the united states .
the assistant lepsa maijya declared serikova that no notifications were received towards the singer : it &quot; is complicated it to answer a question , that really this is gregory &quot; who &quot; everyone is talking &quot; about &quot; in connection with scandal in the usa now &quot; .
everything that knows leps is information of the mass media .
there were personally officially no notifications to his place although i do not know whether they are in such cases .
&quot; and , of course , this is funny all , on the one hand , and from another has been astonishingly and suddenly &quot; , she declared to ria of news .
according to her statement , in pxukete gregory leps does not live , but as a ministry of finance is confirming the usa it really has the house on the thai island .
she declared , that now leps is in the long round on the far east and siberia , and that they found the news it during the flight to the blagoveshchensk town .
do you have black box in the car
while the american planners of the roads are trying to find the money for the repair of the strewing system of the main roads , many people begin to see the decision in the small black box carefully placed on the instrument panel of your car .
these devices registering every mile being proezzhaemuyu by the motorist and submitting this information to the officials are in the center of the controversial attempt of the modernization of the system of the financing of the highways of america , one undertaken by the planned organs of washington and staff which became obsolete .
the boring arena of the planning of the highways suddenly normally generated the intensive debates and the colorful alliances .
libertariancy joined some ecological groups in lobbying of granting of right to the government the uses of the small small boxes for the tracing of the quantity of the miles proezzhaemyx by you and even , it is possible , that , there are also uses where you are passing them , then this information on the composition of the tax bills .
the movement of tea drinking shock .
the american union of the civil freedoms is deeply also troubled and is picking up the series of the questions concerning private life .
and although the congress can not make arrangements yet if to continue or not a few staff are not preparing to wait .
they are contemplating how one can go in the next decade to the system by which the drivers are paying roads for every mile , which they are passing .
thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes , the part from which have the function of the satellite tracking to a test
this is really necessary for our country .
this not that question » did not say as for which we can have a right of choice » xasan ixrata , the executive director of the association of the governments of southern california which is preparing the plans of beginning of the tracing by the authorities of the staff of miles being proezzhaemyx by every californian motorist , by 2025 .
changes in how we are paying these taxes will be .
technologies are already for this .
the necessity of this is increasing with the absence of the resources from the governmental fund of the construction of the main roads being financed at the expense of the taxes which the americans are paying on refuellings .
the americans have not bought so much gas anymore as earlier .
the cars pass more miles of one gallon .
federal tax even , 18.4 cents in a gallon , already 20 years have not risen .
the politicians do not want to improve the tax of even one cent with high prices of gas .
« it is simply impossible to keep « the » gas « tax » , said li mannich , the expert on transport policy , in the university of minnesota .
recently 500 registering devices of the test of the system of the pomiljnoij payment were installed in his staff on the cars .
this will be the best alternative in the long term » , he said .
the pains in the neck are calling this pomiljnoij user-defined pay .
it is natural that this idea draws the city liberals , to an example , in so far as one will be able to change the character of the trips for the reduction of the capacity utilization of the roads and the ejections of the hothouse gases with the help of taxes .
the planned organs in california are observing this system in the course of the development of the strategies for the achievement of the goal indexes established by the ambitious laws of this staff in the fight against the global warming closely .
however the member of the representatives &apos; chamber bill wuster ( the republican , pennsylvania ) , the chairperson of the transport committee of the chamber , said that he is also discussing this system as the most viable long-term alternative .
the adherents of the free market in fund « reason » are also excited about that what they will force drivers to pay for every mile .
« the tax which will go into the black hole » did not tell ehdrian mur this simply » , the vice-president on political questions to reason .
the people are paying for what they are receiving directly .
this movement is also being kept up by the two usa which were the ministers of the transport which called upon a congress in 2011 to move in the direction of the pomiljnoij payment .
the senate of the usa confirmed last year the pilot project with a value of 90 million dollars which about 10 000 cars would take part in .
however the leaders of the representatives &apos; chamber turned down this proposal due to the fears of the village legislators introducing voters which has to pass often many miles in everyday life , in order to reach to work or to the town .
nevertheless , a few staff and towns are going around this way independently .
the largest enthusiasm appears in staff of oregon , where for the participation in the biggest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are being attracted .
these drivers will soon for the miles of the run instead of gas tax pay to staff
in nevada the pilot project has already been completed .
in new york it is looked at .
illinois is testing it on the limited basis with the participation of the cargo cars .
and the coalition studies i-95 who transport departments of 17 staff of the eastern coast are entering ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virdzhiniyu and florida ) as they will be able to conduct these changes .
this conception did not receive the common recognition .
in nevada , where about the volunteers &apos; 50 cars were equipped with these devices recently , the drivers were disturbed with the government being able to register every their step .
« the uneasiness according to cause of &quot; the big brother &quot; and similar things is a big problem » , told a khan , the matters of strategy and department of the effectiveness in the department of the transport of the staff of nevada manager , alauddin .
this was not the that people wanted .
after the tests were going on at full speed , the department of the american union of the civil freedoms gave advance notice in staff of nevada on its web site it will be « quite easy « to turn these devices into the instruments of the full scale tracking » .
there is no necessity to create the huge , cumbersome technological infrastructure which will inevitably be extended for the storage of the entries about separate citizens &apos; everyday transfers .
nevada is one from a few staff where the difficult searches of the inexpensive technology which would have allowed the authorities of the staff of the information the account of the miles proezzhaemyx by the car are being carried out , but without information about place and the time .
if you will be able to do this , a khan said , the society will feel more calmly .
the searches of this technology led some agencies of the staff to the small young company in california under name true mileage .
this company did originally not deal with the assistance in the collection of the taxes of the staff
she strove to go to the developing market of the type of selfinsurance on which the drivers are paying according to run .
but the devices which it is testing are drawing the planners of the roads because they are not using gps and are granting limited amount of information having been loaded with the help of the modem periodically .
« the people will be inclined to do this if you are not registering their speed and their location » , said raijan morrison , the executive director true mileage .
a few big mistakes in several things were from these pilot programs of the staff
there are much less expensive and less obtrusive ways to do this .
in oregon the planners are experimenting with the granting of the different versions to the drivers .
they can choose the device from or without gps .
or they can quite refuse the device after deciding to pay fixed collection according to the middle number of miles which all the inhabitants of the staff are passing instead of this .
in other places they are hoping to sell the idea to the nastorozhennoij public after forcing to make the devices more , and at least .
in new york the transport officials are striving to let work out the tax-covering device which will also take the payment on the parkovochnym counters « pay , as you » are « going » also to gather the insurance the pool of the data about the speed in real-time operation from other drivers which the motorists could use to avoid the corks .
« an advantage which they will offer them will draw the motorists to a participation » , is speaking in the document of the city planning design .
however , some planners of the transport systems are thoughtful about whether all the conversations about the pomiljnoij payment by simply huge diverting factor not being .
in the city transport commission in the field of the bay of san francisco the officials say that the congress could very simply have overcome the bankruptcy of the confidential fund of the construction of main roads after raising the taxes to gas .
one would be able to collect an additional single or annual tax from the drivers of the hybrid cars and other persons whose means of transport are not using much gas that they paid their fair share .
« there is no necessity in the radical surgical intrusion , when is everything that you should do this to take aspirin » , said rehndi rentwler , the director of the legislation and public relationships commission .
if we will do this , hundreds of millions of the drivers will worry about their private life and the lot of the other things .

dad francisk will elect the new cardinals of the catholic church to the dignity for the first time in the period of its service on 22nd february as the vatican declared on thursday .
the cardinals are the highest clergy in the catholic church after the dad , and namely they are electing the dads so francisk will appoint his first group of the people who will ultimately participate in his successor &apos;s choice .
at present there are 201 cardinals .
however after the achievement by the cardinal of 80-year-old age he is not able to take on the dad &apos;s polling any more — this is a prerogative of a group of 120 « cardinals-vyborqikov .

dzhek valero from « catholic voices » organization said that by february the number of the vyborqikov-cardinals is , is probable , will come down .
he said that the dad is normally calling so many cardinals how much is necessary again to bring the number of the cardinals vyborqikov until 120 , as well as so many cardinals in an older way at the age than 80 years , how many it will want .
the consistory will have a great importance in the next year because it will be first from the moment of the election of franciska in march this year , in words valero .
at the present time svoego roda a prejudice exists for the benefit of europe and especially for the benefit of italy .
« it will be interesting to watch whether the new dad of the cardinals from other regions of the peace for the reconstruction will fix the balance » , he noted .
in south america forty percent of the catholics live , but they are introduced by the insignificant number of the cardinals .
this also will be the first chosen cardinals since the time of the formation franciskom the cardinals &apos; counsel — a group from eight cardinals from the whole world by which looking the methods of reform of the church is put in charge .
in the past the dad has been solving everything independently .
« now francisk chose eight cardinals that they helped it said valero .
he said that it is completely possible that francisk will turn to the cardinals for counsel .
but we were not in such a situation before this все this for us is for the first time .
valero said that the dads normally elected the bishops from big receipts to the cardinal &apos;s post , but francisk « is full of surprises : therefore we do not know who he will « name » .

the next session of the association of the mechanics of the tyumen province took place in the base of yalutorovskogo of the automobile factory .
within the framework of the measure a presentation of the new line fit through the production of the electrowelded chimneys of steel .
as the managing director of the business denis gribanov said , in 2011 with the appearance of the new owner the marketing research in the research of the commodity market of the steel constructions is conducted in the tyumen province .
it turned out that the region uses more than 50 000 tons of the electrowelded chimneys in a month .
after this the decision about the change of the profile of the factory and the set-ups in it of the equipment for their production were taken .
already in this year more than 7 000 tons of the made production are shipped .
the factory capital investments were more than 120 million the руб leu : denis gribanov said .
in october the new figure is neglected , which it is allowing increasing the assortment .
at a factory simply one big - for building branch is being let out as the small profile of the chimney which is being used for a tep-personal economy , the small forms of the construction and in a furniture industry .
we are planning on leaving for the output level of 50 000 tons of the production in a year , which will be about 10 percent from her consumption in the tyumen province .
despite the transition to another type of activity , the co-workers &apos; number did not decrease in the business - now it is 157 people , in plans on the purchasing of the new equipment - the increase of the personnel still more than by 50 workers .
in the business a further training of the personnel is going , and the necessary specialists are tidying up themselves from the already available ones .
next year bringing the new aggregate is planning longitudinal sharp the steels with a thickness up to five millimeters , that it will allow reducing the cost price of the production , as well as another figure , at a speed of the production of the chimney up to 47 meters per minute .
towards the end of 2014 in the business they are preparing to master the issue of the chimneys which are being used for a housing-communal economy .
the leadership of the business is assigning the task to close up to 70 percent of the requirement of the tyumen province of this production .
the deputy of the director of the department of the investment policy leonid ostroumov advised to pay the greater attention to the modernization of the machine building businesses turning to the leaders of productions .
also the forms of the state support for industry which include the compensation of interest rates according to credits of the purchasing of the new equipment and outlay on his leasing are directed towards this .
in the current year on these goals it is foreseen to pick out 150 million roubles , two thirds of this amount are already spent .
the last commission which will discuss the agreements of subsidization is taking documents from the businesses before the 15th november .
besides , the outlay on the participation of the local producers in the international fairs is being paid by the budget .
the next year the resources at the rate of 150 million roubles which one can use for the compensation of leasing payments and credits of the acquisition of the new equipment are foreseen by the budget .
5 million will be allocated for the participation in the fairs , 3 million are on the programs of energy saving .
up to 72 million roubles of resource for the compensation of the ordered one and equipment paid for which is being made for the petrol complex in the south of the tyumen province come down .
according to leonid ostroumov , in perspective this form of support will stop because a compensation of the the loot of the mineral resources tax which the oil companies were paying a budget in the regional one was the motive of her introduction .
at present they are not doing this and the subsidies are becoming the direct expense obligations of the region .
with account this the government of the field thinks priority the direct support of the industrial enterprises , and not the financing through them of the oil branch .
the help of the budget will be connected to the investment projects which will be sold on production .
many heads of the businesses expressed the concern in connection with the developing situation in relationships with the oil industry workers .
the grant for the equipment bought up by them is the competitive advantage of the industry of the south of tyumen province , and on her abolition price will match itself against the middle stripe of russia , where a cheaper workforce is , in a difficult way .
moreover , a question with the succession of the new owner tnk-vr is unclear - the company &quot; rosneftj &quot; which has not put its orders in the tyumen businesses yet .
the agreement on realization of the uvatskogo project flows out in 2013 , and the application to his prolongation was not received .
at present the businesses of the south are fields which are specializing in equipment for petrol sector , can not form the portfolio of the orders for the next year .
a question remains open , taxes will really come to the budget of the region from mineral oil to be extracted in the uvatskom district or they will be paid on place for the registration of the new owner of the deposits .

this opening is the brightest sensation of all the book of marka galjperina and the john xaijlemanna about the campaign of 2012 being expected &quot; rates are doubled : the game changed 2012 &quot; .
the edition the times received the copy of the book preparing for an exit and announced on thursday evening that the president &apos;s nearest assistants led « the large-scale researches into a focus-groups and the public opinion polls at the end of 2011 in order to appraise the exception baijdena can really help to raise the hopes of the re-election going out obamy .
according to the political reporter the times dzhonatana martin , the book gives the detailed description of the attempt of the prominent officials of election headquarters and the white house , but namely the former head of the administration of bill dehijli white house to appraise , what effect will provide on a vote purpose the former secretary of state clinton a vice-president .
possible replacement was secret , being thoroughly protected in chikagskom election headquarters and in the oval cabinet
only the six nearest advisers of the president — including dehijli , the former head of the election headquarters obamy dzhima messinu and the former more senior advisers of the white house of david akseljroda and david pluffa — knew , that replacement is looked at .
the book of &quot; rate are doubled &quot; he asserts that dehijli was the initiator of the attempt to replace baijdena , despite their « close personal relationships » , but ultimately refused this step when they showed their data , that clinton into the list of candidates will not « improve » the addition « substantially chances obamy » .

the legislative bans forced russians to drink less beer
the russian brewers have a bad mood .
on their prikidkam , the consumption of beer will remain in the former level in the country next year , and this is in a better case .
although the business persons originally counted on the growth .
but a present year is developing for them unsuccessfully : the sales fell down of 7 percent .
the chapter told to one of the biggest brewing companies of the country about all this , the chairperson of the counsel of the union of the russian brewers isaac weps is in the iii annual conference of the institute of the adam smita &quot; goods of the everyday demand in russia &quot; which was ended in moscow just now .
in it they discussed the state control of the market .
from 2008 to 2012 are years the russian market of beer already decreased of 18 percent , in so far as in the last years in the country the essential intensification of the control of the brewing branch in the part of production and the turnover of beer is observed - drink with small alcohol content , i / you / he informed the listeners weps .
there is not such a hard restriction of the market of beer in a single country of the peace unpredictable introduction all of the new and new illogical bans which supposedly are being substantiated by the fight against the abuse of alcohol .
the brewer complained , that many legislative bans called upon to reduce the level of the abuse of alcohol do not provide a particular influence , nevertheless the new initiatives constantly appear all .
boljnee all on the producers of beer struck the ban brought since this year on selling alcoholic beverage in the kiosks .
&quot; we lost 35 000 consumers immediately &quot; , said isaac weps .
the next year the brewers have two forecasts .
that which weps talked about is optimistic : the sales of the foam drink will remain at the former level .
pessimistic one - they will fall down still of 2-3 percent .
in order to keep their profits , the business persons have to escape the types calculated for the mass consumer to a class &quot; premium &quot; : the beers will become smaller , but that will cost more .
meanwhile , you can not see the radical consequences from the fall of the sales with the small quantity of alcohol yet .
&quot; on my observations , the level of the diseases of alcoholism is left behind approximately at the same level , announced a doctor-narcologist alexei sotnikov .
really , the share grew the patients that are using the surrogates of the strong drinks , as well as those who &quot; sat down &quot; on the spirtosoderzhaqie drinks toning up like &quot; yaguara &quot; , while namely a &quot; beer &quot; alcoholism predominated ten years ago .
wherefore will a construction bring tpu in moscow
within every year metropolitan authorities promise to furnish more and more knots of transports and transfer ( tpu ) .
until 2020 people are planning on introducing 255 tpu into a system .
our correspondent knew a lot what the project is in practice turning into .
a couple of months ago near the subway &quot; smolensk &quot; arbatsko-pokrovskoij of line arose the building fence .
the inscription said that the development of the knot of transport and transfer is going on .
all this was really strange , in so far as next to &quot; smolensk &quot; no overland transport is stopping and , therefore , it is impossible to sit down on it
in order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the garden ring , it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters , including the overland transition across the karmanickiij alley .
now near &quot; the one smolensk &quot; almost everything is finished .
a flower booth disappeared , the stand ground for newspapers is dismantled , and asphalt before the entrance gave way to the plaster .
there is the whole transport knot
they are explaining , the knots of transports and transfer are flat bed and main sometimes , in the news service of the metropolitan department of the transport .
main tpu have not been here yet .
but the ones flat bed suppose construction the parka wok , the conclusion of the trade objects , the passengers that are obstructing movement , the creation of the small designs and improvement .
in fact , not the transport workers , but the professional welfare organizers from the department of the complete overhaul of the town of moscow are even dealing with flat bed tpu .
the transport knot is not not certainly complicated construction , is explaining the director of the institute of the economy of transport and the transport policy of the college of the economy michael blinkin .
sometimes a roof above the head and indicator boards that notify of the time of the arrival of the transport are enough .
here , for example , near the subway &quot; yasenevo &quot; they opened the completely full-fledged flat transfer knot recently .
will let without the awnings but with the intercepting parkings and the indicator boards that explain when the bus will come .
but in the pursuit of the quantity the officials are writing down in all the tpu what not popadya .
the city hall has still in 2011 been planning on building on all about all 151 knots , of them 59 sec main construction .
now 255 tpu quite appear in some plans until 2020 .
of them полтораста promise to give out already in this year .
there are not designated any qualitative criteria , although there is a program of the development of the tpu in the town : alexander morozov , the cochairman of the public organization &quot; town and transport &quot; , is stating .
they are giving a report on the quantity of the objects , but a quality of change often worsens on each of them .
criteria , according to the expert two have to be : secondly - comfort first a decrease of the time of change is .
you have to change possibility above all the transport method without going under the rain .
in moscow it after all leaves exactly conversely on the development of the tpu at times .
the bright example of the subway &quot; of the vdnx &quot; .
the earlier suburban buses arrived from the yaroslavl highway into the public garden before the main entrance in vvc .
now they carried their stops on the opposite side of the gorge warbler on the astronauts &apos; street .
is further from the subway , is considerably further from the monorail , but is closer to the apartment houses .
although the inhabitants did absolutely not want the bus station under the windows and the possible instances complained into all .
with main tpu in moscow did not set somehow immediately .
they began to build the first of them near the subway &quot; glider &quot; five years ago .
the project was called upon to become model .
and a model of the that really came out as the transfer knot given to the investors to the farm tenancy , is turning into the banal trade center .
no , there are platforms for the buses , an awning also three floors of the parking lots here in order not to come from the subway in the rain .
really , № 202 and № 203 did not give to the ximkinskim trolley buses fundamentally in moscow tpu of place .
they moved them as the foreigners aside from the subway as far as possible .
but places are more under commerce remained .
one only the clothes 32 shops , but , in general , there is almost everyone - from the zoya goods to the motor show .
of course indeed , suddenly which of the passengers of the bus will need to buy the new car on the way ?
when they are building main tpu our trade center has for different reasons always turned out .
recently situation reached its logical completion after they had decided the part of the parking lot it to reek under the market .
now on the third floor of the tpu &quot; glider &quot; among planned ones to the skirt of the parkovochnyx places a brisk commerce is going .
the vegetables , the spices , are chinese jeans , non-russian speech and the guards who spitefully look at our photographer .
the transfer knot turned into the market in a final way .
the thing is that earlier the subway &quot; glider &quot; had a market , but they took it down .
and in the prefecture they felt sorry for the merchants and put on the intercepting parking of the transfer knot
anyway due to high prices it is empty there always .
the one very after all funny , that they took down the market for the sake of in order to build in his place ... new flat tpu .
such a is castling here .
near the subway &quot; kaluga &quot; the distance of approach from the vestibule was the subway to the bus 50 meters : alexander morozov is saying .
after the construction of the trade center , supposedly tpu , the distance increased up to 170 meters .
in order to sit down into the bus , it is necessary to fit through the whole trade center .
after 22 hours , when it is closed , one has to outstrip it under the open air .
however , the constructions will soon seem like flowerets on &quot; glider &quot; and &quot; kaluga &quot; .
in the middle of september the city planning land commission of the city hall confirmed the planning decisions for first eight main tpu .
four of them will be 25 stories , without regard to two to three underground stages .
the main monster will appear near the subway &quot; tuwino &quot; , there will be 418700 square meters of the area in it
the representatives of the head office of the railway stations of the rzhd responsible for the construction of the tpu near the subway have already told to the journalists : in future mnogoehtazhkax the shops , the hotels and the apartments will be situated .
at the same time the officials swear that the multi-layer parkings of zaij ­ mut are from third up to half of the area
we will take the &quot; people &apos;s &quot; garages for example .
we will say , the garage on 258 car which recently they erected in the international street has the area of 8015 square meters .
this means for parkinga of 2600 automobile near &quot; petrovsko-razumovskoij &quot; &quot; about 80 000 squares &quot; will be needed .
this is smaller than the third from that maxiny which there they are preparing to build .
let one to two floors go to all platforms for the buses .
it remains like the minimum of 150 000 square meters of the commercial real estate .
but this , on the minute , almost two guma .
if railwaymen are building main tpu at the stations and the stations , the metro employees will settle the remaining grounds .
they also promised that many &quot; objects &quot; of the functional purpose &quot; will be , including the hotels , the offices and even the gyms .
is by the way , in the department the properties of the town of moscow told the journalists which they work out the project of the decree according to which the investors will be able to turn for tpu to the officials outright during the receipt of the area recently .
without all contests .
therefore , probably , that the transport questions for the town are priority .
ideal tpu is , for example , these are stations &quot; garvard &quot; in boston or &quot; spadaijna &quot; in toronto , alexander morozov is convinced .
there the trolley buses and the streetcars are going down under the earth on the level of the subway and the distance of the approach from a car of the subway to the streetcar is 50 meters in total without exit to the street .
around any unnecessary commerce .
but he is deserting the moscow officials in extreme .
either we will not form anything or we really otgroxaem 25 floors with the offices and the apartments .

the profit bombardier is coming down with the fall of the deliveries and the quantity of the orders for the planes
the corporation bombardier , the canadian producer of the planes and the trains , announced the reduction of the net profit by 15 percent under the influence of the quantity of orders and deliveries of the planes in the third quarter and problems with the contracts which diminished on thursday in her railway subdivision .
the company bombardier put in montreal did also not publish any data on the flight tests of her newest plane of cseries and did not provide the new information about whether the ambitious plans being fulfilled according to the introduction of the plane to the commercial use by the next september .
after the first flight of the experimental model of the aircraft , taking place about one and a half months ago , it still flew only three times , which is causing the questions whether stage of the graph tests is going on .
results did not find excuses for forecasts and led toronto to the fall of the shares at more than 8 percent in the stock market .
kehmeron doerksen , analyst national bank financial , reduced his evaluation on thursday from « above of middle market » before « of middle market » due to the conviction that the growth of the actions is limited into the nearest quarter or the nearest two .
« although the reduction of the quantity of the deliveries of aircraft was predictable as a whole , we , undoubtedly , are disappointed by the indexes of the profit of the transport department » , said doerksen in the review of the fund market .
we believe that bombardier will receive the new orders in cseries according to the continuation of the program of the flight tests .
nevertheless , if he will not be declared about new orders in next months , we suppose that the market will more sceptically relate to a program .
the company bombardier hopes that the family of the planes of cseries will allow her to conquer the place in the lower price segment of the market , where boeing and airbus dominate now .
the first experimental model of the aircraft was presented in march and the flight in september carried out the delays for the first time after a few months .
meanwhile however no hard orders for cseries have been too many to 177 in so far as the potential customers are waiting for the results of the flight tests in order to check the assertions of the company about fuel effectiveness and the potential economy of the new liner .
all now are 403 orders and an agreement with 15 clients and operators .
the executive head director pierre boduan was convinced that bombardier will attain his goal into 300 hard orders at the moment , after the first plane will be started into the commercial use .
on thursday the leaders also assured the analysts and the mass media that the program is progressing in a plan forward .
« the test model of the plane has not been left behind on earth longer , by which she was being « expected » , said boduan after adding that the overland tests and the renewals of the software were planned for the downtime of the plane during the telephone conference .
all the producers are planning the tests differently .
we decided to organize the first flight and to take the break on the renewals , we also so acted .
it will so occur during the whole program of the flight tests .
the flight on next weeks has to make the second of five test models and all remaining ones will follow it soon as the company announced .
and nevertheless the analysts are sceptically relating to a statement about the first client being able to begin the use of the plane of cseries 12 months after his first flight .
the company bombardier declared that she is estimating the period of the putting into operation and will provide the new information in a few next months .
this slow tempo of the flight tests is at least , in all probability , and it corresponds to the inside graph bombardier - supports our point of view , that the putting into operation will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015 » , doerksen said .
in the third quarter which ended on 30th september the net profit bombardier decreased up to $ of 147 million , or 8 cents for action from $ of 172 million , or 9 cents for action last year .
the corrected profit on action remained former — 9 cents .
the valovyij income decreased unimportantly — with $ 4.2 are up to $ 4.1 billion .
the analysts expected the profit of 10 cents on action and the valovyij income of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the fourth in the peace according to the size producer of the planes announced that he installed 45 aircraft in a quarter , which is smaller than index in the previous year — 57 .
the common number of the orders fell down from 83 to 26 planes .
the portfolio of the orders of the aerospace department was $ 32.9 billion in 30th september without having changed since the 31st december .
« in the aerospace field results corresponded to our goals , however the low number of the orders being received and the common market conditions became unpleasant factor » , said boduan .
the valovyij income from aerospace direction fell down of 13 percent — up to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the producer of the trains , biggest in the peace announced that the valovyij income appeared in this sector by hardly 11 percent — up to $ 2.1 billion .
the portfolio of the orders was $ 32.6 billion in transport subdivision in 30th september , which has been a little above index from the 31st december .
the problems with the implementation of a few big contracts negatively effected the earnings of the transport subdivision .
the instruction declared that in the fourth quarter the new plan of development will be presented .
the shares of the company bombardier which also announced that the head financial director of the corporation google patrik pichett will join a board of directors fell down of 8.5 percent — before s $ 4,83 in the trading in the middle of thursday .
the brazilian company embraer sa , the third in the peace according to the size commercial producer of the planes and the nearest competitor bombardier , announced the decrease of quarterly income of 10 percent on thursday .

the executive director said that he is not taking the co-workers &apos; explanation about it being for them awkward to inform its higher leaders about a situation .
according to his statement , their friendship with the lord took them away from the thought about the necessity to announce it rather .
g-n xehijr said , that it presented his opinion about that to the advice to ymca of new south wales , that the lesson for organization from « incident with lord dzhonatanom » is not « concerning the granting of the information » on the side of the co-workers , also the counsel agreed with it
g-n xehijr declared that the decision to force the co-workers to sign the agreements on confidentiality was soon after the appearance of accusations made by the general manager of ymca in guardianship above the children liamom uitli .
he said that this was called upon to avert the damage of proof , but at the same time they were « overzealous » and they badly realized this decision .

when it begins to provoke , she feels the extreme cruelty from the prioress-sadist &apos;s hands and is becoming the object of the erotic fantasies for the other ones .

due to its serious ceremony povestvovanie risks to become a test like vlasyanicy and for auditory .
