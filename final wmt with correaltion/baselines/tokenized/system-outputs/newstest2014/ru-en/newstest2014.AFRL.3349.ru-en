anger over the verdict to the organizers of the terrorist attack in bali
the remaining survivors and relatives of 202 dead as a result of the bombing in bali in 2002 , reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators , who appeared before the court and stated that umar patek should be shot .
patek , who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive devices used during the attack .
he may be released within 15 years , if she gets parole .
was the defendant was convicted of mass murder in an attack on two night club in the popular tourist area of kuta , during which killed 202 people , including 88 australians , and injured dozens more .
he was also found guilty on a number of other charges related to terrorism , including in the wave of bombings of churches across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment , although they could insist that the man nicknamed &quot; the master &quot; for his reputation for making explosives , should be sentenced to death .
this decision has painful memories of the mother from perth june , which lost its 39-летних jane and jenny in the terrorist attack , effected and helped him nearly ten years ago .
barely restraining his tears , she said that patek was supposed to be sentenced to death .
&quot; i really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys .
he must appear before a team , &quot; said ms. the aap .
&quot; i have to live every day knowing that i will no longer be grandchildren and i don &apos;t see my daughters . &quot;
&quot; the sari club &quot; was destroyed when it was set in motion a massive explosive device , implicit in a van parked outside , just after 11 p.m. on october 12 , 2002 .
peter hughes was in the bar &quot; paddy &quot; , where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack with explosives , only 20 seconds earlier .
after that attack , he fell into a coma for a month and &quot; died &quot; three times , being connected to a life-support system .
mr hughes said that patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of jemaah islamiyah , responsible for a bloodbath - , and imam who were executed four years ago .
indeed , this guy deserves the death penalty over all .
to save his life , well , there is no reason to save his life .
get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds is not so much .
patek is the last of the terrorist attack in bali before the court .
he was hiding for almost a decade , but in the end was arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani town of abbottabad , where u.s. forces killed former al qaeda boss osama bin laden less than four months later .
during the trial , an fbi agent testified that the intelligence showed : patek was in pakistan to meet bin laden in an attempt to restore the ties between southeast asian terrorist groups and al-qaeda .
&quot; he didn &quot; t give up , &quot; said ms ..
until recently , he is not sorry about how much grief he caused others .
the sentence imposed on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack , which will be celebrated later this year in bali and australia .
&quot; this year there will be a lot of tears , &quot; said ms ..
patek can still appeal his sentence .

the two detective have tracked the suspects and found , as he approached the home in and put drugs 60-процентной purity in black golf course under garbage boxes of a lawyer .

the accusatorial speech ann wight said : &quot; if anyone knows what we should not violate the law , then it is an attorney in criminal cases . &quot;
mr. is accused of abusing his position of counsel in criminal cases because he came in too close relations with certain customers .
contact about which we say - it is not easy , but that supplies the drugs of their own lawyer .
some of his conversations , of course , turn out to be valid , because he was their lawyer .
however , it largely shifted the boundaries of normal relations between lawyer and client .
he headed off to the police investigation as much as it is possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activity .
mr. not his profession , and it .
he too moved closer to certain customers , in particular , scarborough , and allowed to doubt in his non-interest .
did not admit guilt and said : &quot; if i was a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and i would like to convey information , mr. scarborough , i would not wait for 15 hours , i would have done it immediately . &quot;
but after meeting senior officer lee halstead , of lancashire police , said : &quot; mr turned from counsel in criminal cases in the criminal offender as soon began to buy drugs from representatives of organized crime . &quot;

investigation of mr. led a division of lancashire in a particularly dangerous organized crime , which has already secured for him the sentence on three cases of storing cocaine , and now on the exercise of justice , demonstrating our desire to achieve a fair punishment for criminals .
let this case will serve as a warning to criminals that nobody is beyond the reach of the law .

the manufacturers of jet aircraft feud over seat width , when large orders at stake
between the leading manufacturers of aircraft , a bitter dispute over seat width tourist class on long flights , setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the dubai air show this month .
the dispute moves around the width of seats available to economy class passengers on long-haul flights , whose interests are not always in the focus of attention of airlines , with the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by boeing co and airbus sas .
airbus this week called for an industry standard , which would have included the width of the seat at least 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in economy class stores , but its main american rival , boeing says it must solve the airline .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their long-haul planes , and the event 17 - 21 november expected potentially record orders .
the layout of the rear part of the plane - especially the sitting whether 9 or 10 people in a row - occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of the new &quot; projects &quot; .
boeing argues that its new 777x will be reduced to 406 people , proceeding from the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width , placed by 10 in each row .
airbus says that its competing version of the a350 will be transported in the economy class , there 350 people on seats 18 inches wide , located on nine in a row .
aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of professional advertising in the press .
now , airbus is appealing directly to the public before last in dubai , where the 777x , is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders .
she recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing financiers slide representing three people in the restaurant , each other , titled &quot; you would agree to this ? &quot;
&quot; boeing offers haul flights on seats more narrow than the regional turboprop aircraft &quot; , said airbus sales chief john .
with the change of diet of people gaining weight , but seat has not changed .
between the beginning of the 1970s , when the wide-body boeing 747 asked the standards of modern long-distance travel , and abroad century weight of the average american men aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent , according to the department of health of the united states .
waist , the average american male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches , according to the statistics of the u.s. public health service .
airbus argues that her rival adheres to the seats of the 1950s , when the average waist of those recently called &quot; reactive audience &quot; was already .
airbus says it ordered a study indicating that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent .
boeing disputed airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find balance between tariffs and amenities .
according to her , the research shows that usability salon depends not only on the width of the seat .
&quot; it really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do what they think they need to do to succeed , &quot; said specialist boeing saloon in kent .
they do not want it solved for them that will bring them profits .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers , the question is to increase the space on the sides , but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits .
behind this dispute is worth the race for orders for planes , estimated at least $ 700 billion on prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of the american and european exports .
as first reported by reuters agency in july , the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the newest planes .
as the airbus as well as boeing claim 20-процентном improving profitability at one place in their latest long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment , 365-местным boeing 777-300er .
the claimed characteristics of the boeing are based in part on comparing 10-местных rows 777x with original 9-местной layout of constructive solutions 777 .
winning the specific cost declines when compared with 10-местной layout used currently .
&quot; the reason why boeing is doing is to squeeze in more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development , &quot; said kevin , head of passenger comfort airbus in europe .
on the other hand , analysts say that salons with full 10-местными rows for existing 777-х indicate that many passengers prefer dense , which can go hand in hand with lower fares .
&quot; seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers , but the reality is that from a commercial point of view , the proposal airbus due to the threat from 777-й model , &quot; said specialist interior salon mary kirby , founder and editor of girl network .
airbus and boeing does not provide chairs , but offer the catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .
exploring the world of salesmen jets even blocking the roulette to verify the competing plans .
praising comfort , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights .
airbus a350 offers with 10-местными rows , but says she still does not sell it .
until recently , airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons offering broader aisle seats on some of its planes .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft , as the experts say , her appeal to new industry standard is hardly &quot; will soar , &quot; but it might distract attention from the wave of sales models of 777x .

once it was known rebel movement , which was driven by the first white government of rhodesia , and then the government of south africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country .
after the armistice of 1992 it became an opposition party .
analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again for full conflict , but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents .
the stakes are high for a fast-growing economy , since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest may be able to raise more than $ 50 billion , as investment in the next few years , from companies such as rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko of the us .
the ruling party , frelimo , a leading political force since 1975 , and the party have accused each other of that tension .
the party argues that the government has become the latest clashes , attacking its members in the province of sofala , traditional , on october 17 .

as frelimo and insist that they want to avoid war .
but worries have grown after reports that stated refusal from the peace agreement of 1992 .
he told the financial times that meant a failure to comply with the agreement of the frelimo party .
&quot; our goal is to return to negotiations , but very seriously , &quot; he said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to ease the tension , which led to a series of clashes this year .
&quot; this is two influential person ( and ) guebuza , faced against , &quot; said joseph lecturer , open university and an expert on mozambique .
none of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go on the necessary concessions .
the party , which is trying to get electoral reform , has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted it as an attempt to pressure the movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government .
the share of votes for the declines since 1992 , while a new party - the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) , which was founded by former member , is expected to improve their performance in these elections .

&quot; he doesn &quot; t want a multi-party democracy , he did not want to transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to leave the post of president , &quot; he said .
it is unclear what possibilities it possesses , but she already has devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from the north to the south .
most of the clashes took place in the province of sofala , which is located just a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , but includes a port that mining companies , including rio tinto and vale , use to export coal .

when he was asked a question about whether repeat this threat .
the party wanted to &quot; warn the international community about what matters in mozambique are not very good , &quot; said .
instability has strengthened popular discontent with the government , but many people are also concerned about corruption , slow pace of development , and more recently , kidnappings , says fernando lima , head of the independent media companies .
&quot; people think that the responsibility for the future of the country are the government and the president , who must find a solution to these problems , &quot; he says .
omar , a participant in the demonstrations , said that people just want stability .
&quot; nobody cares neither nor frelimo , they just want a renewal of peace , they want access to the roads , &quot; he said .
rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in australia so far remain in force
australian airlines passengers will need further off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing in the united states , despite the measures to mitigate the regulations concerning data devices .
the federal aviation administration , the united states has allowed u.s. carriers to change its procedures so that passengers could read electronic books , watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing on the condition that they will remain in the &quot; flight mode &quot; .
passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight , but many annoying because they do not have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing .
australian carriers consider this decision from american airlines to spend an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the new requirements , but pointed out that they are not planning to in the near future to change their procedures .
in managing the safety of civil aviation , also noted that they consider this statement , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight still operate in australia .
&quot; management of civil aviation safety currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft &quot; , it stated .
this issue is regulated by rules that require air carriers to ensure the maintenance of security at any time , and from passengers - to comply with safety rules , of which they are members of the crew .
the company virgin , which has already been discussed with the safety of civil aviation expansion of its onboard entertainment system with wi-fi , was not opposed to changes , but said she would follow the directions of the regulator .
&quot; we would have welcomed a review of the safety of civil aviation question about allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now , when she ( onboard wireless entertainment system ) is on our aircraft &quot; , said the spokesman .
said it would adhere to the existing rules at the moment .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices may not be used during takeoff and landing , and soon we are not planning to change it , &quot; she said .
the faa is distributed on american airlines .
nevertheless , we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers , and we will , of course , carefully study the decision of the faa and the reasons that caused it .
u.s. carriers to influence decisions will vary from airline to airline and will depend on their age .
carriers will have to prove that their airplanes have resistance from mobile devices , as well as to revise manuals , training materials , guidelines on the bag of hand baggage and instructions for passengers .
&quot; after the airline will inspect and confirm its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices , such as tablets , electronic books and smartphones , at any altitude , &quot; the faa stated .
in rare cases , poor visibility crew will give instructions to passengers turn off their devices during boarding .
in addition , according to the recommendations of the group , the more severe the device must be placed under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during takeoff and landing .

coulson has resorted to phone hacking to inspect confidential messages
the former editor of the news of the world andy coulson allegedly used &quot; phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; when trying to confirm false information about the novel of charles clarke , who at that moment the post of minister of internal affairs .
prosecutor royal lawyer andrew told the old bailey court that in may 2005 , the newspaper news of the world received false news that clark meets with his attractive &quot; special &quot; .
the newspaper commissioned a private detective to hack voicemail and have her home to interview , but coulson also called her and left voice messages , &quot; the court heard .
&quot; the prosecution maintains that mr. coulson , who is now the editor - he is not such a person who will stand beside somebody &quot; homes , hoping to find someone by surprise , he is a man who loves history to suggest to people to see what they say , &quot; said mr ..
he said that the newspaper news of the world had used three ways to investigate stories : phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation .
the editor personally implicated in the third .
obviously , he knows about the second , about surveillance , he simply must .
what about the first ?
whether he knew about hack phones ?
he says no , we say : &quot; oh , yes ! &quot;
rumors about the novel clarke first attracted the attention of the edition of the news of the world , when the source , sexually interested in ms , said : &quot; don &quot; t waste time , she and charles . &quot;
cassette with voice messages obtained from her phone at least three times , was removed from the home in august 2006 .
investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective , in which miss and her sister included as &quot; projects &quot; .
during the period when she was under observation , grandmother and grandfather , ms. received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her , said mr .
at this time the former chief reporter neville and former reporter james controlled the spying on her eye .
leaving her voice message on june 18 , 2005 , coulson said : &quot; i have the history that we plan to publish tomorrow and which i would like to discuss with charles . &quot;
mr. said that participation in this story was the same scenario as with other influential people , for example with the former minister of internal affairs david .
the jury heard on thursday that coulson has entered into a confrontation with mr over affair with a married woman while he met with brooks , who was married at the time .
coulson and brooks have denied membership in conspiracy with others to hack phones between october 3 , 2000 and august 9 , 2006 .
, and confessed to hack phones .
the bases of the ministry of internal affairs is no grouping &quot; fraternal circle &quot; , to which the u.s .
in the databases of russian security forces groups &quot; fraternal circle &quot; to which washington canonized singer gregory , doesn &apos;t exist .
as noted , &quot; interfax &quot; in the law enforcement agencies of the russian federation , after reports appeared in the media about the case by the u.s. treasury gregory in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal &quot; fraternal circle &quot; , were checked all databases , but such groupings have been found .
the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called &quot; russian mafia , which allegedly operates abroad , believe in security structures .
&quot; even in the title - &apos; brotherhood &apos; circle , there is an element of mystery , a hint of a secret lodge .
&quot; all this is very similar to the interlocutor of agency &quot; , he said .
the us treasury announced on october 31 , i sign to their checklists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal &quot; fraternal circle &quot; of arthur , gregory , vadim , sergey moskalenko , yakov and igor .
the persons listed in this list , suspected of links with some vladislav and rakhimov , who are influential members of criminal groups and are in the u.s. sanctions lists since february 2012 .
according to american authorities , grigory leps &quot; serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of vladislav leontief &quot; .
in the heart of gregory declined to comment on the us charges against the singer , calling them &quot; nonsense &quot; .
in 2011 , u.s. president barack obama took the syndicate &quot; fraternal circle &quot; among &quot; significant transnational organized criminal gangs &quot; and instructed the ministry of finance &quot; to undermine and their global criminal operations &quot; .
entry to the man in black lists of american finance entails blocking his assets in the united states and a ban on business contacts with him persons residing in the states .
scientists shed light on how the tail of a dog tied to her mood .
earlier research has shown that happy dog tail in the right side ( from the point of view of a dog ) , while worried dog tail mainly in the left side .
but now , scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in the tail and react to them .
professor giorgio , from the university , said : &quot; it is well known that people from the left and right side of the brain in different ways to participate in shaping the stimulators , which are positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we have tried to look at this and other species .
he added that just like humans , dogs have the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body , and vice versa , and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs react to various tails of other dogs , the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs .
they measured the frequency of a heartbeat of animals and analyzed their behavior .
it is likely that very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction and sometimes in another .
the professor said : &quot; we have shown the dogs video with dogs - or naturalistic version or silhouette , to get rid of any other distorting factors , and we could manipulate the motion of the tail and guide the tail more to the left or to the right . &quot;
when the animals seen that otherwise nothing expressing the dog had driven the tail right ( from the point of view of the tail of a dog ) , they were totally relaxed .
but when they noticed that the tail was largely left ( again , from the point of view of the tail of a dog ) , their heartbeat and they looked alarmed .
the professor said that he did not believe that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements .
in fact , he believes that dogs have learned from their experience , about what movements they should worry , and what is not .
he says : &quot; if there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tail in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior , while the right side gives less friendly behavior , then the dog reacts on the basis of that experience . &quot;
researchers say that these findings may give owners , vet and deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal .
an expert in the field of behavior of dogs , john bradshaw , a visiting researcher in veterinary school , bristol university , said that it was not the first study to verify that are important for dogs , the left and right side .
last year , a group of scientists from the university of lincoln found that dogs turn the head to the left , if they look at an aggressive dog and right , if they look at the dog .
and in other scientific work at the university of victoria in canada , he reported : &quot; dogs often approached when its tail drawn to the left , not right , rather than become alarmed - the opposite behaviour towards the italian research . &quot;
he said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not entirely susceptible animals in films or as dogs .
it could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs , he explained .
&quot; while in various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes , many details still have to be reconfirmed , and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
however , given the ease with which may be registered by their behavior , it is likely that very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction , and sometimes - in another .
if europe &quot; s elite is ready to do business with england ?
business for britain campaign was launched in april with the obligation to collect the representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the uk want to see in relations with the eu .
to this end , we ordered the biggest and most complete survey of british business leaders , asking them to express their thoughts about the uk business and the eu .
the company has surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide slice of business in the uk on the size , sector and region .
the findings of the survey will be a surprise to many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for opportunities for exports outside europe , paying special attention to countries that carry out the modernization and grow , while eu countries are stagnant .
they want a government priority to new trade relations with countries such as china , india and brazil , not has spent time on a long and difficult process of reforming the complicated eu institutions .
when they were asked about their opinions on specific political issues , from antitrust regulation to laws on products , most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned .
there was a general dissatisfaction with the single market , and business representatives claimed that the costs of regulation from brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in a commercial zone of europe - have agreed to this even 40 percent of large enterprises , traditionally the most bitter back from all companies .
the last and most indicative - our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants britain to held course on treaty change and on relations with the eu , based on trade , not politics .
this result , which was among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest shows that business insists on &quot; meaningful change &quot; which would bring powers back to britain .
the stakes are high - achieving changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the uk will provide 16-процентный shift in voting for it to stay in the eu .
the prime minister , there should be no doubt : this poll shows that british business supports his plan to revise the terms of british membership in the eu .
it also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a major shift in the balance of power back to the uk .
the best conditions for british businesses are possible and become increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial integration .
priority must be given to jobs and growth in the uk and , as shown by the results of our survey for business this means greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in regulatory activities in brussels .

in siberia , should not be devoted vegan : tomato does not replace
why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in siberia , ria novosti correspondent .
people are totally refusing from animal products , should not live in siberia .
here they did not transfer the winter without losses for health , and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them , believe to be interviewed on the eve of the day of vegan new siberian and doctors .
drink butter
strict vegetarianism when refuse not only from meat and fish , but also from the milk , honey , eggs , it becomes a way of life .
however , sure in novosibirsk in siberia and other cities to adhere to the same stringent standards in nutrition , at least for health .
complete refusal of animal products harmful .
in animal proteins contain essential amino acids , which are very difficult to compensate for the plant .
you need to be sure to include in your diet even if milk or eggs , &quot; sure nutritionist marina .
she cites the example of fish , containing an indispensable omega-3 fatty acid .
most rich them vegetable oil is linseed .
&quot; to make it necessary for human numbers , you need to drink ! &quot; says a nutritionist .
doctors believe that the residents of siberia , particular attention should be paid to the winter .
in this season of vegetarianism is particularly challenged .
in terms of our realities are the high demands for food .
to keep warm , increased calorie needs .
&quot; if people limit themselves to animal products , respectively , this caloric value it &quot; , says a specialist .
with this agrees olga późniak coat of arms .
she adds that imported fruits and vegetables is not a solution .
it is better to eat mainly products which grown in the region of residence or where he was born .
the genetic code is configured to better digestion and for these products .
and during the winter , people want is not totally ok puppy and hot , or something else , &quot; explains his position doctor .
according to her , that can have a truly useful different grains , cereals , legumes , local vegetables , apples , remaining in the winter , frozen berries .
but this is clearly not enough for nutrition .
according to claudia , the siberians in organisms level sufficient vitamins only from mid august to mid september .
the full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh environmental conditions , when temperatures may one day change at 30 degrees and snow lies in may .
the body needs energy for life , and this is , above all , the fat , &quot; notes medic .
doctors say that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women .
children grow , they need a construction material , including in the form of amino acids .
but adhering to vegetarianism , we give them inferior .
pregnant women also need a high content of protein , vitamins and minerals in the menu .
&quot; their bill &quot; , sure .
says adult free to choose anything , &quot; to play with the toys , which wants &quot; .
he has already formed an organism , the skeleton and organs .
but the children still need to eat better .
if the parents are depriving him of trace elements and amino acids , choosing for him that he will be there , it is just a violation of the rights of the child .
&quot; the lack of those or other substances for the development of the brain , bones of tomorrow will not be &quot; , she says .
all interviewed agree about the low quality of the winter in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables .
what to bring and grown up in greenhouses , contains fewer essential micronutrients than us ( grown up ) in the open ground .
&quot; the quality of the products is not that &quot; , he said .
also notes that imported and greenhouse fruits and vegetables are far from ideal standards .
sometimes the desire of the manufacturers to collect the larger crop damages the quality .
&quot; the apples are brown not to cut quickly , cucumbers and tomatoes and tasteless &quot; , cites examples of the medic , adding that they probably are excessive amounts of fertilizers .
and suppliers are not vitamins , and fiber .
it did not agree the siberian physical-technical institute of agricultural issues , candidate of agricultural sciences vera petruk .
she says that with the right approach , and observance of all standards and requirements in greenhouses may grow full of vegetables .
if trying to push more with a square meter , then , of course , and to become more often and plants mineral fertilisers .
for example , when too much nitrogen fertilizers , tomatoes are growing rapidly , they are large , watery and but , &quot; she explains , adding that the question of quality , in the first place , depends of conscience from the manufacturer .
russia beyond the struggle for urban pollution cars
attempts to solve transport problems of large cities were observed in most cities around the world since the second half of the 20th century .
as a rule , it was either about their &quot; imaginary &quot; and expanding highways , or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trip , the number of cars and the time of their use .
there is a well-known example of singapore where introduced strict quota increase in the number of private vehicles , and the right of their purchase is bought at auctions .
its price is two to three times more than the price of the car .
european cities , including london , have introduced a fee to enter the city center .
in germany , for example , in hamburg and stuttgart , introducing the so-called green zone , where entry is permitted only with a specific vehicles that use the fuel of high quality ( including biofuels or electric cars ) .
beijing &quot; s environmental protection agency , for example , approved in 2012 &quot; five-year plan for clean air &quot; worth about 250 billion yuan ( about $ 40 billion ) .
as he told kommersant the director for control of transport pollution of the municipal bureau of environmental protection in beijing , lee , the main objective of the plan is the reduction of major air pollutants by 20-35 % by 2017 , an increase in the number of private vehicles to a level not exceeding 6 million ( currently 5.2 million ) , as well as an increase of no more than 5 % of the use of fuel per one vehicle .
according to the agency , now motor vehicles in beijing responsible for 22.5 % of total air pollution .
among the key measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport , as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners .
among other things , the urban &quot; green &quot; measures in the plan include a streamlined compared with the rest of the country transition to fuel standards , the introduction of local systems and labelling of cars and fuel restrictions on entry of cars in the central part of the city , a ban on the use of outdated vehicles ( besides , creating a financial incentive programs , replacing older cars to hybrid or electric cars ) , the development of electric vehicle ( including public and official ) , the development of public transport ( including high-speed ) .
among the automotive innovation beijing also refers to ban all private cars on movement within the fifth transport ring ( a total of six ) in the capital of them one day a week ( the relevant information is contained in the sign of the vehicle ) , as well as the issuance of registration plates for vehicles based on the lottery ( for example , in 2011 , the first year of the lottery , the total number of permits for registration of private cars in beijing was only a third of the number of 2010 ) .
according to the state programme of &quot; environmental protection for the years 2012-2020 &quot; , the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 ( in 2012 there were 138 ) .
according to the data of the ministry of natural resources and , in 2011 , the &quot; mobile sources &quot; had 41 % of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities .
in moscow , for example , emissions from cars in ten times higher than industrial , and in st. petersburg - nine times .
in the russian federation until just starting to think about the possibilities of restricted regulation of cars on the streets of cities .
the director of the institute of economics of transport and transport policy hse mikhail believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel , is a matter of заведомо unpopular , they can be accepted by society only under the condition of their complete versatility .
in the case of moscow , there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet , where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences , service and personal vehicles , as well as the cars &quot; privileged &quot; users , the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand ( about 5 % of the total fleet of moscow ) .
in the last few days from the center in st. petersburg , prepared the study , which analyzed the balance of urban areas between the residential development of pavement and a number of vehicles .
the main findings of researchers : city center accessible by roads in two times less than the required , and the majority of motorists living in the center , do not use cars every day , leaving them for long periods of time on the market , or simply on the streets .
as a result , it is proposed to build not parking and storage of cars , not to expand and reduce road a part ( so that the streets were becoming more friendly for pedestrians ) , as well as limit the use and placing personal transport within the conservation area of historic centre ( common ground around 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city ) .
the fuel will lead the tax maneuver , which provides for an increase of the mining tax ( epdp ) on oil simultaneously with a decline in export duties and increase excise taxes .
according to experts , these measures could bring in additional budget 619,3 billion rubles .
the trip on dirt , rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care
dr. georges provides free medical care in rural areas in cameroon
and his team spend nearly every weekend , taking hundreds of patients
in this country , doctors are not so much - just one in 5,000 people
vote here or through your mobile device
dr. georges is one of our top 10 cnn heroes of 2013 .
you can vote for him , or for any of the other top 10 heroes , so he became a hero of the year cnn .
this man receives $ 250,000 to continue their outstanding work .
for 21 years , georges saw his father back to life and again sink into unconsciousness , wandering across hospitals , which were not properly equipped to help him .
he was injured in a car crash in 1981 near yaoundé , the capital of cameroon .
at first he had only a broken hand but the contagion spread to the brain and provoked , which reminded about himself to the end of his life .
&quot; in cameroon had no neurosurgeons &quot; , said georges .
if we had the money , we would have taken him from cameroon .
instead , accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals , receiving any treatment that they could get .
&quot; it is not easy &quot; , he said .
- you can leave the house at 5 a.m. to run back to the hospital to be first , but you are not the first .
patients very much .
some may die because they have to wait .
the situation is not much changed since his father died in 2002 .
according to the world health organization , in cameroon , only one doctor for 5,000 people .
by comparison , the ratio in the united states - one doctor at 413 people .
and even if it could go to the doctor , many of them it would not under budget .
two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of health spending in it are private .
&quot; their only problem is poverty &quot; , he said .
poverty - and because they cannot enjoy their life . &quot;
seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots , became determined to do something with it .
last year , dr george and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations .
he became a doctor and works vascular surgeon at the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded the non-profit organization , which organizes trips into the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his team of volunteers have helped almost 32 000 people .
almost every friday , and he is still up to 30 people in the vans , which chain roofs to medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit villages need help .
not always accompanies them luck .
more than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they come , they are met by how true heroes : this holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms , which can only offer the locals .
free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration , and with his broad smile and boundless energy , more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning the brigade begins accepting hundreds of patients .
&quot; we have 500 people on each trip , &quot; he said .
they come from the whole vicinity within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village , and they come on foot .
each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services .
many people get treatment for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others may get walkers , donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents necessary for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evenings the brigade performs simple operation under local anesthesia .
operations tend to take place in a school , community or in the house ; after the procedure , patients come and go in the zone , to make room for the next person .
using a generator to provide lighting operating and sanitization equipment , and its volunteers work until the early hours of sunday .
this pace , but the determination of the brigade typically help to keep rural musicians .
&quot; they all night beat the drums , so we were awake and continued to work , &quot; he said .
on sunday , the brigade members sent back to town , tired but proud of his work .
this group , consisting of foreign doctors and medical students , has 700 free surgeries in the past year , and they know that their assistance may be of great value for those whom they help .
one man explained that they obtained free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again .
&quot; this will change the future for me and my family &quot; , the man said .
in addition to these clinical methods at weekends and work in a hospital surgeon also works nights in a private medical clinics around the yaoundé .
it is this second work , he said , provides 60 % of funding his non-profit organization ; the remaining funds are covered by private donations .
&quot; i don &quot; t even know when he sleeps , &quot; said kathy o &quot; , a second year medical student at a university in philadelphia , the volunteer in the group .
he has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to be able to continue this campaign .
for future doctors and nurses , such as the &apos; coming from the united states and europe to join in the realisation of its objectives , it is an opportunity to practice , which they would never have got at home .
&quot; we have got an opportunity on operations , where we helped remove blood stains or keep tools for doctors , &quot; said about &apos; .
while you would never have received such a possibility in america .
they usually pay for their travel in cameroon , often arriving with pharmaceuticals .
but on arrival in yaoundé , their meals , transport and training pays .
&quot; he is a hero , without a doubt , &quot; said about &apos; .
he gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the people of cameroon indefinitely .
for the almost constant workload work is not an ordeal .
live happy lives to help others perform this promise to his father - that is what brings him great joy .
&quot; i am so happy when i do this job &quot; , he said .
&quot; and i think about my father .
i hope he sees that i do .
i do it to make people laugh , to reduce their pain .
go to the site and see what you can do .
for &quot; russian mafia &quot; in the united states will finally take hold a new name - &quot; fraternal circle &quot;
this week , the black list &quot; of the russian mafia in america by new names and four companies .
the us treasury has imposed a &quot; fraternal circle &quot; of three representatives of russia , two citizens of uzbekistan and israelis .
one of the russians proved to be a famous singer grigori leps , whom the us suspect in transportation money for members of the group .
in all , the u.s. blacklist 22 people involved in &quot; the circle &quot; , and six affiliated with these organizations .
nevertheless , many experts have expressed doubt that it really exists .
&quot; the statement of &apos; sister circle &apos; more like a attempt to unify fragmented criminal groups &quot; , earlier said an expert on organized crime and professor mark galeotti from new york university .
in his opinion , the &quot; fraternal circle &quot; reflects the popular perception of &quot; russian mafia &quot; .
&quot; i haven &apos;t found anyone in russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of a criminal organization &quot; , said mr galeotti american center for research on corruption and organized crime .
with mr. galeotti agrees and liz shelley , a professor at george mason university .

can interrogate in russia
american intelligence agencies , edward snowden , most likely , will not have to travel outside russia to testify in cases of telephone conversations of german chancellor angela merkel .
according to interfax on friday , a source familiar with the situation , an american might answer questions from representatives of germany &quot; s office in writing or internally in russia .
the departure of edward beyond russia virtually excluded .
&quot; in this case he loses his refugee status and may be extradited to washington countries - the united states &quot; , said the priest .
&quot; however , in principle , the prosecutor general of the federal republic of germany could send their representatives in the russian federation or to submit written questions &quot; , added the source , adding that this question should be in an advanced stage at interstate level .
earlier , a member of the german bundestag reported that edward snowden was ready to testify in the case of the american special services negotiations , chancellor of germany .
snowden was ready to testify to german law enforcement agencies either in moscow , or in the territory of germany .
the cia made clear that he knows a lot .
despite the fact that the nsa , the us blocked his travel , snowden was ready to come to germany .
but for this it is necessary to clearly define the conditions of his arrival , &quot; said tv channel euronews .
lawyer anatoly , commenting on the statement of the source of interfax , said his client would cooperate with german investigators , but when and how - will decide itself .
a us citizen edward snowden , who has worked at the national security agency ( nsa ) in the united states and the cia , fled to hong kong in may 2013 , after which spread information about secret u.s. intelligence operations on the internet surveillance .
snowden flew through moscow transit , but could not leave the airport because his passport was rescinded , us authorities in absentia him serious accusations , and until the beginning of august , remained in the transit zone of the sheremetyevo airport .
on 1 august snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in russia for a year , and on the same day he left sheremetyevo .
yesterday , the american lawyer anatoly said his client took a job in the major russian company . &quot;
about the nsa surveillance for angela merkel last week , german media reported .
according to journalists , calls the americans began listening to the chancellor back in 2002 .
tracking station was allegedly at the u.s. embassy in berlin .
the german authorities after the publication of these data indicated that the surveillance of merkel violates laws and sovereignty of germany .
announced the release of racing series land rover
inside are racing seats and seatbelts , and the system of internal communications .
in addition you can obtain better brakes , a package of services , providing access to automobiles works , logistical support and storing the car between activities .
drew bauler , managing director of motorsport , said : &quot; the participants of the rally , traded in , swap . &quot;
some of them are not experienced drivers and people seeking excitement , adventure and access to world-class events .
we are glad to offer such a path in partnership with land rover and msa and believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of the rally in the uk and abroad , as well as to prepare participants to the harsh conditions and realities .
with a great pleasure we developed car defender challenge - it would be a really exciting league .
in addition , defender challenge involves one day in february for training and testing , as well as the opportunity to take part in events in the desert in north africa and the middle east .
children must learn the myths and legends as a &quot; model of lifestyle , &quot; says the author .
tales of the torah could show that &quot; brute force cannot defeat refined trick &quot; , and the legends of king arthur show how important it is to have a dream .
saying that many of the myths are &quot; too wild , too , and in some cases too usa for teaching in schools , &quot; stands for &quot; carefully selected &quot; suitable for the age of texts .
&quot; i think it is wonderful that in america the myths and folklore are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i played for the introduction of their training program in twenty years .
he added that the &quot; excessive &quot; authors and lecturers from &quot; interest &quot; in children , and the basic ideas of &quot; exciting &quot; in history .
, who translated &quot; beowulf &quot; from the anglo-saxon language , and also wrote &quot; the collection of norwegian myths &quot; for publishers penguin and the british folk tales , &quot; said : &quot; you can of course be the intention , but you better keep them with him . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between adult author write for adults , and adults author write for children , is the need to feel some kind of hope .
not that everything should be simplified or lead to the end of the happy , but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil .
and it must be solved through history ; and not clearly formulated .
the old principle : to show , not tell .
goldman sachs warned about the risks for the russian economy
goldman sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in russia - consumption .
this is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in employees .
our main concern now is not that growth has slowed , but rather the structure of this growth .
lately , he is entirely driven by consumption , which almost does not ease up turnovers , &quot; said chief economist at goldman sachs in russia clemens box representing yesterday quarterly report anywhere on the russian economy .
now the nominal wage growth in russia is about 10 % .
with inflation at 6 percent , he will be able to meet future consumer demand roughly at the current level , expect at goldman sachs .
but the profitability of russian companies is falling , however , it is likely that they will optimize expenses .
today , we see a significant increase in the share of wages in gdp : if wages are rising by 10 per cent , while gdp is only 2 % , &quot; explained mr box .
companies faced with declining profitability .
if it does not rise , it can lead to lay-offs and rise in unemployment .
not to raise the salaries of russian businesses cannot , narrated by the chief economist at barclays capital in russia and the cis , vladimir .
unemployment near historical lows , competition for workers is high .
in order to attract employees from the side or to retain the current employers to raise wages .
consumption in russia ­ and very fast growth .
according to mr. fields , because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans effect on the economy of the country , this kind of lending is not .
&quot; the benefit to the economy from growth , we have not seen any money , not diverge on the economy , and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments &quot; , said economist .
but the problem in another - at goldman sachs expect growth of arrears on unsecured credit .
they are mostly not rich who have nothing to offer as collateral .
interest rates on such loans are high .
as a result , they often do not return , &quot; said mr. column .
so the second threat to economic growth in russia - a possible crisis of arrears on unsecured credit .
the director of the hse institute banking vasily already sees signs of a banking crisis .
small credit organizations without access to cheap resources , which have been forced to attract means from population with high interest .
in response , out on the trail of the war and began to cut lending rates , &quot; continues the economist .
small credit organizations cannot give loans under the same interest rate , otherwise they will have negative interest margin .
if not abandon dumping , russia threatens a full-fledged banking crisis , believes vasily .
depriving the licenses of some banks in recent weeks , the economist believes it to be the harbinger of a mass crash .
&quot; themselves with such a situation fails : the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis &quot; , warned the head of the institute .
but consumption growth will slow and without crisis defaults , believe in the prestigious , &quot; due to the refusal of indexing salaries for civil servants and the military , inherent in the current version of the draft budget .
partially hit consumption will be softened by the tariff freeze natural monopolies ( and , as a result , reduced inflation ) .
but only partly : if investments do not rise ( and the prerequisites for this are not yet available - see the certificate ) , the growth in consumption is still slow , sure in goldman sachs .
vladimir from barclays capital until it sees the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios .
&quot; the main risk is still falling oil prices &quot; , he says .
in his estimation , russia &quot; s economy begins to shrink with the cost of oil below $ 90 per barrel .
at goldman sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to cut interest rates in the economy .
there is a paradoxical picture : inflation has fallen , and banks have been raising rates .
this may mean that they did not believe the central bank , the transition to inflation , &quot; said clemens box .
the central bank &apos;s policy on market rates did not affect , affects only the interbank lending rates .
&quot; for the central bank , it is the collapse of all expectations &quot; , praised clemens box .
the money obtained at auctions , the central bank , banks are not lending to the economy , and to manage its liquidity
as soon as the reduced rate , just changing the exchange rate , it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the rouble .
&quot; sooner or later , the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working &quot; , said mr column and reminded that allow the ruble to &quot; float &quot; the state is planning by the end of 2015 .
but will either do it before , or pick up a key central bank rate ( 5.5 % ) , he says .
in his estimation , the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10 % .
only one road - the ruble weakening , &quot; concludes the expert .
but if the central bank in even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of exchange rate band is not part of the policy to weaken the currency , it can ruin the ruble is much stronger .
snowden agreed to give testimony about merkel
the bundestag mp met moscow with edward .
during the conversation , they discussed the question of whether snowden might be questioned as a witness in the federal republic of germany in the case of possible phone of german chancellor in the united states .
snowden has expressed its readiness to give the necessary indications .
the meeting could be held either in moscow , or in germany .
he made clear , &quot; he said &quot; , that knows a lot .
and despite the fact that the national security agency whale alexander blocked all his travel , snowden was ready to come to germany .
but first we have to clearly define the conditions of his arrival .
meanwhile , u.s. lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding the u.s. spy programs .
the senate committee on intelligence approved a bill yesterday to portray the additional restrictions on the activities of american agencies electronic intelligence .
faa : &quot; air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes ( but not call from a mobile phone ) &quot;
will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music , but not talking on mobile phones - according to the long-awaited new guidelines , published on thursday , the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately .
how quickly such a change is implemented , will vary depending on the airline , &quot; said faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
faa , airlines will have to show how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for members of the flight crew and the rules for laying devices to conform to the new guidelines .
faa announced that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
delta and jetblue were among airlines , which have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the condition of the plan we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; said faa .
currently , passengers must turn off their smartphones , tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes .
they should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and captain will not give &quot; good . &quot;
passengers should turn off their devices again when a plane goes down for planting , and will not include them until the plane is on the ground .
in accordance with the new guidelines , airlines , whose planes properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff , landing and , the faa said .
most new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes , is expected to meet these criteria .
laura , president of the association of professional flight attendants , welcomed these changes .
&quot; after the new policy will be implemented safely ( and we are going to work closely with the carrier , in order to achieve this , it will be the win-win option , &quot; said .
we frankly are tired of feeling &quot; at school &quot; when it comes to this issue .
but internet connection for surfing , exchange of electronic letters , text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at the height of less than 10,000 feet , the agency reported .
passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices in airplane mode .
thus , still no &quot; words with friends &quot; - intellectual gaming , in which actor alec baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011 , when there was a notable case : the actor was filmed with the airline american airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the aircraft was at the gate .
but heavier devices , such as laptops , still need to be laid in the office because they can injure someone if they were flying around the cabin .
calls from the mobile phone in flight also will still be banned .
regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the federal communications commission , not the faa .
faa may remove a ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
last month mark from the national council on transport security , national security expert for cbs news , said that cell phones are still considered at risk .
&quot; cell phones - it really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices , but we know thanks to the fcc , that it could interfere with cell phone towers when the plane is in the air , &quot; he said .
an advisory committee created by the faa to study this issue , recommended last month that the government allowed the more widespread use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years , the growing pressure on the faa with the aim of easing restrictions on their use .
critics such as democrats senator from missouri claire , argue that there is no legitimate reason for the prohibitions relating to security .
the restrictions also becomes more difficult to provide , as well as the use of devices has become ubiquitous .
some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off its devices .
faa began to restrict passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of for navigation and communications equipment , when passengers began to carry - high-tech gadgets of the time .
new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they also developed and approved by the faa as resistant to electronic interference .
the airline offered passengers using wi-fi at cruising altitudes already for several years .
planes , modified for also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices , according to new guidelines , huerta said .
today &quot; s electronic devices emit radio signals are usually much lower power than previous generation devices .
devices for reading electronic books , for example , emit only minimal signals at pages .
but signals are becoming stronger , when devices upload or send data .
among those who pushed for easing restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices was a company
in 2011 , company representatives have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books for kindle and flew him to check for problems , but never found them .
faa advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents no risk .
douglas kidd from the national association of airline passengers , said she thinks the interference from devices real , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages to pilots , confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems , and most of these messages are very old .
nevertheless , the committee recommended that faa has allowed pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during landings on basic in limited visibility .
a group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed these changes , calling them a reasonably intelligent step toward passengers who now use a variety of technological devices .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection , &quot; said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
vilnius suspects moscow in an attempt to slander the lithuanian president
russia intends to implement the informational provocations against senior officials of lithuania and the countries of the eastern partnership - a statement the agency bns has made in the department of state security of the republic of ( the ) .
information about this is published on the portal delfi .
according to the report , in particular the moscow intends to &quot; booked &quot; lithuanian president grybauskaite and publish fraudulent documents allegedly found in russian , which relate to the facts in the biography of lithuanian leader .
according to the security services , the preparation of information attack leads analysis department of public management processes of the administration of the president of russia on and cultural relations with foreign countries .
the structure is headed by evgeny , repeatedly lithuania also took part in the lithuanian people &quot; s party congress .
also , the participant of the operation allegedly is a member of the b. smirnov .
according to intelligence agency , smirnov under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 , regularly came to lithuania and member with local politicians , political scientists and media representatives .
it is now banned from entering the territory of the country .
on the eve of the lithuanian president grybauskaite said that she knows about upcoming on it .
in her opinion , the main causes of the lithuanian presidency in the council of the european union is successful and &quot; aspiration nation toward energy independence &quot; .
lithuanian leader had previously not once criticized the actions of the russian authorities .
so she declared that the kremlin to lithuania are &quot; insufficiently respectful &quot; .
in addition , grybauskaite accused the head of the russian federation vladimir putin to nominate to lithuania &quot; requirements alone &quot; .
recall that in september of rospotrebnadzor suspended imports of lithuanian &quot; &quot; in russia .
it was reported that the quality of products does not meet the standards .
then the lithuanian leader said that if russia did not lift the ban , the government must prepare an appeal to the wto .
the new vaccine can deprive the process of smoking pleasure
scientists have developed a vaccine , which could deprive the pleasure of smoking cigarettes .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .
further tests are needed before the trials on humans , in that it will take a few years , but professor ronald crystal from cornell medical college in new york said that the first results are encouraging .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit , all methods available in the market today , but they discovered that nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means , &quot; said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies .
the virus infects liver cells selectively , which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies .
antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood , neutralizing the negative them before they reach the brain , preventing a smoker strike .
in tests , mice , which later gave nicotine , continued their normal activities .
but the mice who were given the vaccine , &quot; relax our effort relying solely , &quot; and it is a sign that the nicotine reached out to their brain &quot; , say the researchers .
these experiments described in the journal science medicine .
previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies .
in order to maintain a high level of antibodies , injections needed to do so often that they were expensive .
but the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies .
professor crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe , it would give the children before they have a desire to try a cigarette , preventing addiction .
but it is more likely that she will use smokers to quit .
&quot; they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and that can help them get rid of this habit , &quot; he said .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but warned that further studies are needed .

frontier airlines will charge for hand baggage
frontier airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for what they bring hand baggage on board his flight .
frontier airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or , even though their announcement on wednesday has been that passengers will be able to leave a whole jar .
the new charge applies to hand luggage bags in the luggage compartments , so the small bags placed under the seat remain free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 , if the fee is payable in advance and $ 100 if travellers will pay only once at the gate .
a spokeswoman for frontier kate &apos; said that the $ 100 fee should force passengers to take care about payment in advance .
&quot; we do not want to charge for it , &quot; she said .
airlines began to charge for the first and second bag in your luggage , in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid these fees , as much as they can in hand baggage , in upper luggage compartments because of what these compartments are not enough places .
charges - one way to carry fewer passengers on board .
o said that this new fee is actually not for the sake of making money .
the fact is that the most loyal clients frontier say find a place at the top of the luggage compartments becomes increasingly difficult .
passengers who buy tickets on the site of the airline should not be paid .
this means that one passenger in the queue at the frontier flight might be able to carry a bag for free , while the next customer in the queue may pay $ 100 for the same bag .
o said that changes to procedures on the website and in registration counters frontier is meant to ensure that the passengers will know about collecting before they get to the exit of the gate .
a new frontier for hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer , although the date has not been settled .
passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees , but the airline adore them .
they argue that baggage handling costs money , and passengers who need this service should pay for it .
many on wall street believe the addition of baggage fees sign that airlines collect enough money to cover the costs of flights after several years of losses .
but most of them are out of hand baggage fees .
spirit airlines inc. has introduced the first hand baggage fee for three years ago and another discounter air later followed her example .
the only other airline with this collection is hungarian wizz air , a consultant for airlines , said jay sorensen , who closely tracks the extra fees .
in his assessment of the report from december 2011 , the charge for hand baggage brings the spirit of $ 50 million per year .
sorensen , a former midwest airlines senior manager , recently flew on flight spirit , and he was wondering what he finds at the gate , where the passengers will face an unusual collection of spirit for hand luggage .
&quot; the process of planting was the smooth from those that i have seen in my career in the airlines , &quot; he said .
i expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and the landing passed rapidly . &quot;
frontier also follows the spirit in relation to fees of $ 2 for coffee , tea or juice .
frontier said that passengers who receive or juice , can leave a whole jar and that coffee will be provided free of charge .
it will still be free to distribute water .
us airways for a while trying to charge for drinks in 2008 , but abandoned that after seven months , after passengers began to complain , and no other major airline not followed her example .
the initiative of the frontier to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline , is her latest measure to attract customers to its web site .
airlines pay tickets , such as orbitz , from $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
this gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them , not to travel .
but all frontier went further in this area .
in september , she started to give two times less miles often flying passenger clients who bought tickets through online travel agency .
on wednesday , she cut the number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel .
so , the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier , bought from online travel agency , would get 250 miles .
in addition , passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the website of the frontier .
the frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of denver , but its business is shrinking and becoming loss .
revenue decreased 9 percent , and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter , according to financial results announced on wednesday the parent company republic airways holdings inc .
republic tries to improve finances frontier in the sale of the airline .
putin achieved impunity for his friend assad
and now , news of the ocean , namely from syria , where , as we learned today , israel struck on missiles of russian production , which , according to reports , were intended &quot; to hezbollah &quot; .
today , syria has fulfilled an important condition is to destroy their chemical weapons production to 1 november .
this was done in the framework of the agreement reached under the mediation of russia and enabled the united states not to conduct a military operation to which they closely came this summer .
read more about weapons and about what all this means for the syrian president , tells our chief international correspondent richard engel .
washington said that the assad regime will be punished for it .
more than 1,400 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in august from poison gas .
and the punishment came .
but not in the form of u.s. bombing , but in the form of transaction , which made a friend of assad - vladimir putin .
syria abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year .
and today is an important milestone .
a group of international experts reported that syria knocked out the factory .
the more long term and an arduous task - the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it .
as we understand this about a thousand tons .
earlier , washington said that assad &apos;s days are numbered .
i believe that assad must go .
the question is not whether this will happen , but when it happens .
he no longer and must go .
but assad remains .
and he feels more confident .
his forces are still using artillery , rockets and napalm .
his opponents are divided and poorly armed .
his people were forced to leave their homes , many go hungry .
some are forced to eat leaves and cats .
many believe that bashar al-assad has escaped punishment for mass murder .
the agreement on chemical weapons are called the success of diplomacy , the inspectors was awarded the nobel peace prize , and assad himself impressed person ready to cooperate .
today in washington , the u.s. ambassador in syria had to answer tough questions .
when a child dies from hunger , his mother is hardly easier from what he is not killed by chemical weapons .
assad still holds .
and changing weapons on power .

parents of children can choose &quot; indefinite floor &quot;
germany became the first european country which acknowledged the third floor in children born with external sex organs of intermediate type .
the newborn will no longer be necessary to attribute the male or female gender .
the new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children , allowing parents to specify the floor as &quot; uncertain &quot; or &quot; by &quot; in their evidence about the birth .
the purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents that can take quick decisions about surgery for assigned sex of the newborn , and combat discrimination against people .
one man , according to the bbc , he said many years later : &quot; i am not a man , not a woman . &quot;
i will remain patchwork of product created by doctors with bruises and tortured .
roughly one in two thousand children background annually , is neither boy nor girl .
they have one of the intersex , roughly 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development &quot; - the collective term for people with chromosomes , ( or ) or unusual external sex organs .
wallis simpson may have been .
gender identification is still not understood , but most experts in the united states say that when sex cannot be determined , it is better to use all available information and assign to it than to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before the operation , if it happens at all .
new york psychiatrist , dr. jack drescher , who specializes in gender identification issues , said that the new german law &quot; sounds like a good idea . &quot;
children create an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention , but the majority of children do not have them , &quot; he said .
you can assign to the floor without surgery , and then see how personality develops .
science about how the child will develop a gender identity , not too accurate .
nobody can answer questions about why this is happening .
it is like a puzzle about why people are being homosexual .
the report sent to the european commission in 2011 , describes the people as distinct from transgender or transgender because their condition relates not to , and to their biological structure which does not correspond to solely neither male nor female sex , and typical of both at once or not is not one of them .
these features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass , hair distribution cover , chest and physique ; primary sexual symptoms , such as reproductive organs and genitalia , or in the structure of chromosomes and .
the report also gives a general idea about the discrimination faced by transgender people and in the field of employment , as well as the level of harassment , violence and crime on the grounds of bias .
boys from gender variations now have a special camp .
australia and nepal has already allow adults to male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; in its official documents .
in june , a 52-year-old resident of australia became the first person in the world , &quot; acknowledged &quot; in court , having the right to maintain &quot; undetermined &quot; sexual status for life .
according to the ministry of internal affairs , in german passports will be the third designation in addition to the m &amp; f - x , that is .
in neighboring france , gender issues still arouse controversy , according to a news release on the tv channel france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of legislators from france , this a deeply catholic country , signed a petition to remove the &quot; gender theory &quot; from school textbooks .
american website catholic online also expressed disagreement with german law , writing that &quot; in a situation where the world is involved in a new state , where the floor is a matter of choice and sexual activity - no , we are still two pillars of civilization . &quot;
one mother of a newborn child from maryland also reported website baby zone that she would prefer that children installed a floor at birth .
&quot; it is difficult to raise a child and without additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , &quot; she told the web site for parents .
children need stability and confidence .
historically , children born with male and female sex organs , called - named handsome greek god who had signs of both sexes .
and yet just ten years ago the medical community gender as a sheet on which we can all erase and then draw again .
but now many are questioning the ethical justification for surgery , knowing that gender identity is difficult , but doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice , not knowing how the child will be assigned to the floor when he grows up .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century , it was called &quot; urgent psychiatric case &quot; &quot; , drescher said .
when children are born , you rang no psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon .
the dominant theory about how to treat children with intermediate type , was proposed by dr. john mani at johns hopkins university , who believed that the gender easily amenable to change .
he introduced into circulation term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that the signals of the environment , including the social - how parents produce a child - interact with genes and hormones child , determining whether a person is considered to be a male or female .
but in one case of 1966 , known as the &quot; john / joan &quot; , his theories are in question .
he advised the parents of the boy , whose penis was damaged during the suit circumcision fully castrating child , also by removing his testicles , and raise him as a little girl .
&quot; mani has presented the case as a successful example of a transition , but this was not the case &quot; , said drescher .
when he was about 15 years old , he again became the boy and married to a woman .
but in 38 years , he committed suicide .
drescher said that today , some doctors are still &quot; apply this model . &quot;
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , people who survived the operation for a sex change , declared himself &quot; disgusted &quot; by the result .
such was the case , by jim bruce , a writer from montana , who was born with male xy chromosomes , but intermediate type .
doctors could not accurately determine whether he has had a large clitoris , or a small penis , and were convinced that he will never be able to live a &quot; normal life &quot; men .
however shortly after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles bruce were surgically removed , and he grew up as a young girl .
he began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years .
&quot; i knew that i was not a girl , &quot; he said
i was unhappy , but it was very difficult to ask questions .
in the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty .
but being in the depression and understanding that something is wrong , he demanded the medical documentation .
what he learned was dreadful .
i was sterilized at birth , and nobody ever told me about it .
bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development , which gave his body does not produce enough testosterone for normal development of genitalia .
after learning the truth , he again became the man , taking testosterone injections and removing his chest .
the procedure made him sterile .
today , he performs in the protection of others in the organization called interface project , trying to bring in the normal perception of people with .
but ann , executive director of california advocates for legal association is informed choice , is concerned that the german law &quot; encourages to labels and the stigma . &quot;
&quot; many activists are concerned that the german law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child &quot; undefined &quot; floor , &quot; she said .
we are afraid that he will promote the intervention .
we believe that it is better to assign male or female gender , then to wait .
but we haven &apos;t yet seen how this law would behave , so all that we can do is to make suppositions .
she said that her organization supports the australian law , because &quot; it allows adults to make choice in favor of a third floor . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex , &quot; she says .
german law implies its assignment at birth .
it is a battle in which young children should not enter at this stage .
when they grow up , then they will be able to make decisions regarding their own bodies .
but dr baratz , from pittsburgh , which has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group , said that german law &quot; support &quot; as parents as well as children .
baratz &apos;s daughter katie was born with male chromosomes , but she has a violation of sexual development called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome &quot; .
because its receptors work incorrectly , katie have developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but there is no uterus and ovaries .
now , at 29 , katie is married and studies in pediatric psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
despite the fact that she was able to conceive , she hopes to become a parent via adoption or having gestational surrogate motherhood .
the law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves , &quot; baratz said .
he gives them time to do any analysis or understand the situation , as well as the amount of time before they write &quot; male &quot; and &quot; female . &quot;
in this case , you are in the order - baby love child .
you have a lovely child , and you feel joy .
we do not need to hastily make an operation that is irreversible .
&quot; it allows children to participate in solving and eliminates excitement that motivates parents , because they do not feel that doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
in the end , the child decides how paul him or her more comfortable - and that &quot; s fine .
this gives children the opportunity to decide for themselves .

us secretary of state john kerry admitted that when collecting data and american intelligence services sometimes &quot; went too far &quot; , yet the politician noted that appeared in the media information about 70 million people does not correspond to reality .

i accept it as признает and president ... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future , &quot; afp quotes secretary of state .

the court suspended the execution of decisions on the practice of &quot; &quot; in new york police department
on thursday , the court of appeal suspended the execution of a federal district court decision requiring changes in the program &quot; new york city police department , &quot; and dismissed the judge from the case .
the united states court of appeals for the second circuit said the execution of decisions of the judge sheindlin will be suspended pending the results of the appeal lodged with the city .
in august , a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how he carried out a programme of street detention and questioning .
the city appealed to her decision and resolutions on corrective measures , including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police department change working practices and connected with her training program .
on thursday , the court of appeal heard oral hearing on the request to suspend the case .
the court of appeal has said about the need to remove judges because she violated the code of conduct for united states judges and not with the need to avoid the demonstrations of bias , in part because of a series of interviews to the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court .
the judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , without referring to black and hispanic on the program &quot; &quot; .
it has appointed an external comptroller to oversee large-scale changes , which include the reforms in the field of policies , training , and monitoring , and also agreed to launch a pilot program for testing on the body cameras in the police stations , where there is a majority of detentions .
in august , new york has come to a decision to cease the practice of storing the names and addresses of people , cases in which were stopped after a police investigation .
a debate on the appeal of the city should be held after march 14 , 2014 .
the tactic of &quot; stop and searching &quot; criticized many lawyers in civil rights .
&quot; &quot; practiced for several decades in one form or another , but the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of an independent mayor michael bloomberg &quot; s in 2011 , reaching the absolute maximum in 472 330 people , most of them black and hispanic .
in 2004 , four people , all - representatives of national minorities , filed a class action in court .
supporters of the changes in the program &quot; &quot; in the new york police department say these changes they will put an end to the unfair practice , provide a more reliable and effective police service , and could affect how other departments of police carrying out the practice .
opponents argue that the changes will slash the morale of the police and not the level of crime , will lead to unnecessary wastage of money and not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction of the number of police officers on several thousand over the last decade .
the judge noted that it did not stop the practice of &quot; &quot; which complies with the constitution , but changes the way in which the new york police stops of people .
azarov promised ukrainians crash in commodity prices after the signing of the association with the european union
the prime minister of ukraine mykola azarov is convinced that prices will fall significantly in the country after the country will sign an association agreement with the european union .
he stated during a conversation with readers of his page on the &quot; facebook &quot; .
i can definitely say that prices are determined by many factors , among which there , including customs duties .
so , after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on free trade zone , the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the eu will be reduced significantly .
and it will mean that prices must be declining .
&quot; it is with regard to goods that come from the eu &quot; , azarov wrote .
as for other goods , the impact of the agreement on the price will not be so direct , it will be indirect .
but , nevertheless , there should not be a rise in prices .
therefore , the message on which lately enough appeared in our country that association with the eu is rising prices , it is not quite so , or to be more precise to say - is not as &quot; , - summed azarov .
rescue package of $ 325 million for tasmania &apos;s health
the federal government insists that the rescue package in the amount of $ 325 million for tasmania &apos;s weakened health systems will be supplemented with severe conditions which ensure that the state does not spend money wasted .
federal health minister tania announced that the commonwealth takes &quot; urgent measures &quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
the decision on funding over four years , was decided after government consultations with tasmanian independent andrew wilkie declared .
&quot; the government proposed a package of emergency rescue measures , which , we believe , will solve specific problems facing the state , &quot; ms. said today .
a package of $ 325 million includes $ 31 million on the planned operations .
another 2,600 operations , including orthopaedic and surgery to remove cataracts , will help to overcome a backlog .
there is also money for hospitals that accept patients without reservation , in hobart , and to improve the quality of care after in-patient , training medical professionals , mental health services and systems implementation of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals .
&quot; this investment will go on advanced doctors expressed their ideas about how best to help tasmania &apos;s health system , &quot; said ms ..
the minister insisted that the government of tasmania will operate in the mode of strict reporting and accountability .
the state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive cash of the commonwealth , and monthly report about where he spends these additional funds .
the commission will be created from three people to make sure the state provides services like can be more efficient and more effective .
mr wilkie said today that $ 325 million will solve nothing , &quot; if behind them does not follow a genuine reform which would put the health care system tasmania on a more sustainable basis . &quot;
nevertheless , he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance , with which he first turned to the prime minister in early may .
&quot; i hope that the package of federal aid will greatly facilitate the conclusion of the health care system this state from critical condition , &quot; said mr wilkie .
according to the state government , these additional selective treatments largely compensate for recent cuts .
but federal opposition health spokesman peter believes that today &apos;s announcement represents a similar &quot; solution &quot; .
&quot; the reason we are here is that the state labor government had hurled $ 430 million from the health system &quot; , he told abc tv broadcasters .
when the government of the state of lifting nearly half a billion dollars , and commonwealth invests 300 million , you cannot pretend that this is good news .
mr. asked ms. guarantee that no one dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
obama voter &apos;s cry of despair
i voted for president obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
he says obama has allowed republicans to reduce not commendable efforts .
obstructionism cannot serve as justification for the problems with the site of obama &quot; s health care system , drone attacks
memoirs of the obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been
nathaniel p. morris is a student of the second course of the medical faculty at harvard university .
i &apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days .
i thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom on the second year of medical faculty and restore in me a sense of hope .
it is called &quot; insolence for victory &quot; , and that memoirs about the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when i finish in the evening to write reports on my patients and go to bed , this book brings me back to the time when the policy had inspired millions of people , and performances could capture the spirit .
the electoral victory was formidable , and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment .
my classmates crying from joy , and my parents who guarded all newspapers , which only they could find .
the white house had come a young team of strategists , and the nation was ready for change .
during the accession of obama to office in 2008 , his level of support was 82 % .
then i close the book .
this represents a return to the rude awakening , as from a dream .
it is hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of lost opportunities .
during the years that have passed since i dropped his first ballot , the changes actually occurred .
it was that i could not even imagine .
i give obama credit for its large and diverse achievements , from the adoption of the law on available medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from iraq , the repeal of the &quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &quot; , killing osama bin laden .
moreover , i believe that the party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward : immigration reform , choice of public health and the closure of the base in guantanamo , among others .
but after innumerable number of times when i was on the side of the obama administration , defending her in front of colleagues and peers , i have ended with the explanation that i can provide .
i have reached the point of political despair .
republican obstructionism could not explain permission for foreign leaders or strikes on innocent children in other countries .
he could not explain collecting data about the private lives of americans , the national security agency or the persecution of the misconduct of the government .
he could not explain the murder of u.s. citizen anwar al-aulaqi without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign .
he cannot justify the findings of the report , which states that included white house efforts to silence the media , are &quot; the most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and lately , he could not justify what cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care .
i don &apos;t know that i would expect .
whether i was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him ?
it is obvious that work on an elective office is not a predictable programme of action , because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and random events , such as the carnage in newtown .
nevertheless , for all listed me above examples shows that they were largely his own choice of the administration .
and that is what bothers me the most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a strange and gross alternative , it seemed that he is not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views .
i believed that in his second term obama , freed from the pressure of future elections meets hope , about which we have heard for so long .
however , when this week , obama &quot; s approval rating fell below 45 per cent return in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult .
it makes me pine for many promises that .
this week i read that part of the book , which describes how clinton was deafening , obama defeated in the primary election in pennsylvania .
at the meeting on the analysis of the reasons of failures , he told his employees that they must go back to normal and remain faithful to its purpose .
&quot; i want we returned our appeal &quot; , he said .
&quot; we must remember about who we are . &quot;
it has been five years , mr president , and i totally agree with you .
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely .
in egypt , the first freely elected president takes oath of office
mohamed morsi takes the oath of office , but the day of his triumph is unlikely to be the end of a political struggle in egypt .
islamist mohammed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; when making oath , becoming the first freely elected president of the country , having replaced hosni mubarak , who was overthrown 16 months ago .
at his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the fifth head of state in egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he took the oath before 18 judges in black in court on the banks of the nile , built in the style of an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said morsi , 60th engineer with american education from the muslim brotherhood , the fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization , the target for tough action which changed each other governments .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as morsi arrived with a small shortly after 11 a.m. local time .
only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to greet the new president , and , unlike the presidential fanfare since mubarak , the movement was stopped only for a short period of time to miss it on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs .
although morsi ridiculed as &quot; spare wheel &quot; &quot; brothers &quot; , his personal prestige has soared since his victory and a speech friday , in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only islamists , but also all those who want to bring to the end of the 2011 uprising against mubarak &quot; s authoritarian rule .
&quot; egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; morsi said , dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie , judges in the wooden panels hall where he took the oath of office .
later , morsi went to cairo university , where he was supposed to pronounce his speech .
he was to be provided the official reception with army orchestra , the national anthem during which he stood on the &quot; quiet . &quot;
field marshal hussein tantawi attended military figure .
his arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot; the army and the people are one hand &quot; who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university .
founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , cairo university in the 1970s , became a stronghold of islamist student groups .
morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , where the uprising began , mubarak &quot; s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers , which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the ousted leader .
but by agreeing to take the oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is carrying out the will of the military , and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue .
morsi &quot; s speech in tahrir square was filled with theatre populist gestures .
schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics , spelling and grammar
school english literature courses will require pupils to study at least one shakespeare play , a 19th-century novel , romantic poetry and modern british fiction since 1914 .
the exam will also be presented &quot; texts &quot; to encourage broader reading .
the combined english literature and language will be cancelled .
from 2015 , pupils will be obliged to take a final examination in language , with assertive recommendations of choice of english literature as a separate exam .
the department of education will tomorrow release new training programs for english and mathematics - the first passive subjects , radical revision .
he will make changes in other major items in the next year .
separately , the regulatory body in the area of exams will present a revised structure of high school final exams , with the new system of assessments and a smaller amount of course work .
speaking in the summer , education minister michael said he was &quot; there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence &quot; , insisting that the school final examinations will be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
research shows that english schools devote less time mathematics ( 116 hours a year , or three hours per week in the quarter ) than in most countries .
for comparison - the australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year , and in singapore , pupils are engaged about 138 hours .
although the formal requirements to spend more time in the schedule of mathematics would not be , sources in the coalition said that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics , in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings , will likely provide an incentive for granting schools additional training on this subject .
in the curriculums , more attention will be paid to the tasks of the &quot; real life &quot; , including financial mathematics .
football is a cause of discord ?
in the state duma in the &quot; open platform &quot; politicians and experts talking about how to save the world in russia .
among the proposals sounded and such : to ban football in the north caucasus , because from this game - some scandals and discord .

gennady zyuganov suggested to criminalize the &quot; appeals to dismember russia &quot; : &quot; if the us say on the radio that it is necessary to give alaska to russia , you get arrested and given 20 years in prison ! &quot;
vladimir zhirinovsky &quot; would be very hard to build &quot; .
as usual , all he accused journalists who get sick and acute national problems in public debate : &quot; in the heat of debate whether there is little that one can say ! &quot;
the leader of the faction of the &quot; united russia &quot; vladimir vasiliev immediately advised reporters to sign a &quot; charter &quot; and agree to talk on the subject carefully , and then the same obligations may assume and politics .
we have taken about 30 laws that regulate migration , and the procedure as a whole is installed , said mr. vasiliev .
as an example , he cited a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for ethnic peace in their territory .
but ludmila delight about this law is not divided : there is &quot; a clear understanding of what the adaptation of migrants on its mechanisms and limits .
this means that actors will interpret differently the scope of these powers .
in addition , municipalities have no personnel needed to tackle such complicated issues , no money , and methodical recommendations , which they could use , the center does not give them ...
the head of the duma committee on the affairs of ethnic offered to create a special office with formidable name &quot; the ministry of national security &quot; , which would be delivered by issues of national policy .
but valery artem tishkov , who in the 1990s led a similar agency , subsequently opposed .
it is enough to have at the federal level , special person , &quot; minister without portfolio &quot; , to which one might ask , if that .
&quot; we walk on the edge , shells screaming near , it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together to oppose provocation and this work must receive a decent media support &quot; , said the representative of the orthodox church for relations with society vsevolod chaplin .
no state neutrality in relation to dangerous ideologies , including religious , to be , in his opinion , should not .
then oleg away debate in an unexpected direction : &quot; more talented people than in chechnya or dagestan , another search needs , but not pushing them on the way , not on the road &quot; , he said .
&quot; not the road &quot; is the development of football : &quot; the football player beaten across the crowd , the flags are burning , the fellows throw stones each other ...
we may not need such a football ?
there is a different kind of sport - rugby called ...
&quot; they will not be equal in the world in this sport ! &quot; - hotly spoke .
rugby in the caucasus , nobody will not play ! &quot; immediately intervened , mr zhirinovsky .
they offer you another curling !
we must be aware of national identities , it is still that &quot; zaporozhets &quot; offer &quot; ...
in yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands was representatives of the moscow club - during the game with the local club .

according to the instructions of the federal service for the protection of the constitution , germany &quot; s domestic intelligence service ( ) , his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building representations of the united states , which is located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
german media say that hoped to discover the intelligence listening devices , and these actions led to the negotiations between the united states and the ministry of foreign affairs of germany in berlin .
james , the director of national intelligence in the united states , in september , again assured that the united states will not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of u.s. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits . &quot;
but since edward snowden , a contract employee , had become - began to publish your treasury us intelligence secrets , european governments and executives no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word .
reports that the u.s. national security agency monitored the brazilian oil company petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud services providers , including google and yahoo , have raised the paranoia of corporations by the observation of the state , to new heights .
the last straw was the news that the phone of chancellor angela merkel &quot; s auditioned , probably about ten years .
if the most influential person in europe can become a target , then , of course , are potential targets and business leaders .
snowden made an obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the united states and companies .
i think it is quite likely that this data is used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany must wake up &quot; , said oliver grün , the president of the association , which represents small and medium-sized it-company in germany .
german companies believe the us now poses almost the same risk as china , in the field of industrial espionage and data theft , according to a study published in july consulting agency .
in all the documents , uncovered by mr. , nevertheless , so far there was no evidence that the united states passed the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies .
politicians expressed concern that the eu lacks a certain possibilities in the field of information technology and the internet , and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the united states .
businessmen are skeptical of this .
someone in the german parliament says that we must create a google .
i can just close your eyes and open them slowly again ...
&quot; this is not an option , &quot; says the president of the german company &apos;s sap software for business .
if there is a need for a powerful european it industry does not have to allow her to die over 20 years ago .
everything is subsidized in germany : from coal to cars and farmers .
all except the it industry .
and yet the scope and the technical development of us espionage agencies , which became famous thanks to the revelations , was a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the greatest risk of exposure is china .
a big shift is happening in cloud technologies , where leaders of european companies better realized that data stored in the united states , are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to the study , carried out by the trade association of cloud security alliance , about 10 percent of its non-american actors have abandoned plans to use the services of a cloud provider based in the united states after revelations of american data mining program for prism .
jim , one of the executive directors of sap , said : &quot; we are seeing that consumers are asking a new question , which has not occurred a year ago , namely : where my data is stored and whether you can ensure that they remain physically in this jurisdiction . &quot;
many german leaders argue that the last message - this is just confirmation of what they already knew : powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and , therefore , such data should be protected at all costs .
what is the economic espionage is not surprising .
he always had a place .
&quot; this has been a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate , &quot; says kurt bock , chief executive officer of chemical company basf .
americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level , and we are behind them , because it is in our national interests , protect our commercial enterprises .
corporate leaders usually do not like to boast of the retaliation they have taken , as it could provide an advantage to the enemy .
in large companies has long been thought that take free usb drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudently .
ulrich , a member of the board of directors of car company audi , says that for many years it was standard practice - collect mobile phones before board meetings , so they could not be used as a device .
the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany recommends that managers of companies consider using simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones .
prepaid mobile phones discarded later .
nevertheless , there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are leaders in the global market in their particular niche .
&quot; small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience , staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access &quot; , warns the report .
the united states warn their own companies about economic espionage from other countries .
national intelligence summary of the us in february placed france along with israel and russia in the second series of offenders , who are responsible for the economic intelligence , after china , says the washington post .
member of the board of directors of the prestigious german company confirmed that when talking about economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst of all . &quot;
bernard , a former head of the french domestic intelligence agency reportedly said in an interview this month : &quot; services know perfectly well that all countries , even when they co-operate in the fight against terrorism , spying on its allies . &quot;
los angeles international airport was evacuated because of a fire in one of the terminals .

in the transcript of telephone conversations were triggered conversations in august and september 2007 between mr , mr. and steve this , the senior officer , who came to the ministry of ports after work under the leadership of mr in a department of fisheries .

&quot; no , &quot; replied mr .. -
i can &apos;t remember what was discussed , but it was definitely wrong .

the kenyan press indignant provocative press law
&quot; this is a terrible place , and there is reason to question : what can prevent the destruction by parliament , independence of the judiciary in the future ? &quot; - told the newspaper , calling the law unconstitutional .
&quot; this law is very severe and punitive , and we reject it , &quot; said cyrus mau , managing director of the capital group , the parent company , which includes one of the most respected in kenya independent radio stations and news site .
he said a new judicial authority on media &quot; will always be partisan , since it is a continuation of the government &quot; and content and advertising restrictions would hurt kenya &quot; s position in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies &quot; , he said .
according to the newspaper the star , the new law essentially allow the government &quot; to take a stranglehold over the media , &quot; and the standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in kenya &quot; received a serious blow &quot; , and attacked the bill as &quot; a &quot; s draconian . &quot;
the adoption of the draft law is part of measures to enhance national security after the september board of attack by muslim terrorists in the mall .
the kenyan media have sparked anger government records of surveillance cameras , where the troops who were sent to the place of the attack , presumably plunder expensive shopping mall .
the response of the police chief david became a challenge to two journalists and media officer for interrogation , although the call was canceled after the mass protests of the media .
under the new law , publishers could be fined up to $ 20 million kenyan shillings , and individual journalists - up to one million of the additional risk of being &quot; removed from lists &quot; , that is , a ban on receiving official journalistic accreditation .

according to the daily nation , &quot; even one fine enough to paralyze the work of the majority . &quot;

politicians understand that , forcing media silence , they can do whatever they want with impunity .
&quot; nobody ever learns &quot; , wrote journalist matthew nation , describing the kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .
&quot; free-ranging politicians ruin the country and will return us to the hunting and , &quot; he wrote .

eugenia vasilieva spoke after accusations of
eugenia vasilieva , to the person that almost a year of intensive media attention , has still never numerous publications in the press as the embezzlement in the ministry of defence , as well as about her personally - relations with former defense anatoly , her poetry and the love of valuable things .
however , on november 1 , the &quot; break the silence &quot; .
in an interview with life news vasiliev said : &quot; originally , of course , the task was exactly one : pull out from me any negative information about the former secretary of defense &quot; .
it was blackmail on the subject that i must testify otherwise me goes to jail .
today , these threats have stopped .
then we go to court , we will prove his innocence .
we are confident in victory at 100 percent .
at the time of the interview , we can conclude that , perhaps , most of the words that she had no matter with taste .
there are likely to be referring to the official representative of the rf vladimir , that in the collections of paintings , which collected works &quot; &quot; , emerged forgery .
among the arrested property , there are a number of paintings that hostess , being confident in their deep art acquired as masterpieces of world art .
however , the expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings , confirmed that they have no artistic value and , simply speaking , are cheap counterfeits , &quot; said in early october .
any paintings stolen from the ministry of defence .
then , acknowledged that they are not stolen from the ministry of defence , while told me that i have a bad taste .
who has the right to discuss my taste , discuss any personal moments ?
i think it &apos;s just an outrage , &quot; says vasiliev .
at the same time , the question of whether she admits his guilt although in one of her 12 accountable criminal episodes , vasiliev said : &quot; of course not .
admit nothing at all .
moreover , there is no damage to the russian federation concerned .
just introducing people misleading , that &apos;s all .
furthermore , in response to today &apos;s announcement of the rf sc that vasilieva shies away from the study of the materials of the criminal case , the lawyer said he and his client &quot; investigator does not get acquainted with the case &quot; .
what caused the revelations being under house arrest - still not with the press ?
perhaps , as a woman , she could not answer the charge in bad taste ?
or right journalists &quot; &quot; a couple of days ago that she &quot; into an even bigger trance under house arrest &quot; due to the news about reconciliation , anatoly serdyukov , with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family ?
the famous military observer &quot; kp &quot; victor huperzia in his article , &quot; serdyukov returned to his wife ? &quot; wrote : &quot; investigators do not rule out that after such turmoil it may become more during questioning &quot; .
vasilyeva previously some accusations of illegal sale of property the ministry of defence took upon themselves .
juve defender leonardo bonucci is not going to help the team in the championship match with italy . &quot; &quot;
as reported by the football italia , the coaching staff decided not to include it in the application for the game to before the match of the fourth round of the group round of the champions league with &quot; &quot; .

in addition , in the words of mr mikheev , patriotic configured people in russia much more than religious , but at the same time , the law punishes for insulting religious believers and insult patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity .

the agency rosbalt deprived the status of the media for foul language
on october 31 , decided to void the license on the registration agency rosbalt , &quot; writes &quot; ribbon &quot; .
the detention status of media agency insisted roskomnadzor - for the systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media .
in the process , it has created an unpleasant precedent : the court considered it possible to close media outlets , effectively denying the right to nominate counter-arguments .
what is the rosbalt
jsc &quot; informational agency &quot; was established in st. petersburg in 2000 .
in subsequent years , the agency has opened a second head office in moscow and a number of regional units .
the agency also has offices in the countries of the former ussr .
since 2001 , rosbalt evolved and functioned as an information federal agency .
by the mid 2000s , the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media source in russia .
at the same time , rosbalt has always held a rather specific niche : the nucleus of exclusive agency publications were ( and are still ) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies .
talk about the proximity of the security sectors continued throughout the existence of the agency .
along with what rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments , in favor of such assumptions and implied that the project was led by natalia chaplin - the wife of viktor cherkesov .
at the same time , the role of the &quot; &quot; until the end is not clear : often it is called &quot; project manager &quot; .
the director general of the agency is larisa , chief editor - nikolai ulyanov .
lately rosbalt has not featured in the rankings of federal media - neither the quote , nor in the audience .
in october , the agency took 25th place in the rating of russian media attendance sites under the version .
according to the same website , daily crude audience rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors ( and up to 500 thousand views ) , monthly - around three million unique visitors .
among the most popular materials over the past five months , notes about the helplessness of the kremlin in relations with ukraine , the death of the lead singer of the band &quot; the king and the jester &quot; massacres in the capital .
&quot; conflict &quot; with began in july 2013 , when entered into force amendments to the law on the media outlets who banned journalists foul language .
authorities found the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the website of the agency videos ( &quot; dzhigit from krasnodar &quot; , and &quot; pussy riot oil rigs &quot; ) .
further hand describe differently .
roskomnadzor based on detected videos accused rosbalt the gross and systematic violations of the law on mass media and appealed to the court to require the agency to license .
in the &quot; &quot; claimed that claims departments : first , the videos were not material , secondly , foul words in them were masked , and thirdly , immediately after the warning messages were deleted from the site .
the agency appealed claims roskomnadzora world court - and when 22 october 2013 took action roskomnadzora , consideration of these complaints still continued .
but already 25 of the world the judge decided not in favor of &quot; &quot; : chief editor nicholas ulyanova was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video .
obviously , it is the outcome of a hearing in - if refuse from the idea that the outcome could be a foregone conclusion even earlier .
on 31 october , the court decided to admit the invalid certificate of registration of &quot; &quot; , effectively blocking the agency status of the media .
it cannot be said that rosbalt during this confrontation remained alone .
the agency supported the state duma deputies ( a statement in the name of the roskomnadzora alexander signed on 10 october 26 deputies ; the document was filed under the initiative of the cprf ) .
about the closure of the publications that claimed the head of the union of journalists of russia vsevolod bogdanov , president of the moscow journalists union pavel gusev and head of the presidential council on human rights , mikhail fedotov .
moreover , according to bogdanova , guide roskomnadzora even gave him any guarantees that till the revocation of the license deal is reached .
the trial of the &quot; &quot; revealed : under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a means of mass media in russia today is the big question .

the study published in the journal science , on the website you can read his summary .
foxp2 gene is the first known gene function , which is directly linked to the speech .
his role was set up in 2001 , thanks to the discovery of the family from several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes even they themselves do not understand each other .
scientists have found that family members have been disrupted foxp2 gene , but how he performs its function was not known .
in the new study , biologists have shown that at least some of its functions foxp2 performs as a stimulator formation of new synapses in the brain associated with formation of speech .
he carries it through another gene , srpx2 .
the latter was found in a search of factors that stimulate the formation of synapses .
srpx2 was one of 10 similar genes , the authors found , while only in his activism foxp2 .
what srpx2 really affect , scientists confirmed in experiment on .
when the animal gene activity was artificially reduced , they are less yelling at division with the mother .
if the activity of the gene rebuilding , recovering and frequency by sounds .
previously the mice was also shown a link with the foxp2 .
the animals , which injected a copy of a human gene , actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice .
until now , however , scientists do not know whether foxp2 is work and , accordingly , state-steered srpx2 them with purely &quot; mechanical &quot; properties of education sounds or finer processes .

want luminous in the dark ice cream ?
the british entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first glowing in the dark ice cream using jellyfish .
charlie francis used fluorescent properties of marine animal , to develop a light meal .
he came to this idea after reading an article about the research , and has convinced scientists in china chemically recreate glowing protein .
ice cream comes in reaction with the language of one who eats it , increasing the ph in the white of the eye and causing it to glow .
chris says that because the cream begins to glow , which reacts to the heat of the mouth , this means that the more you have , the more it becomes .
charlie , the founder of the company on manufacture of ice cream , &quot; i taste &quot; , says : &quot; it is an incredible thing , but still at the initial stage , if we are talking about the production , so for £ 200 , you get about 2 grams of substance . &quot;
protein that we use in , comes in response to your preferred language in a neutral ph .
however , when your mouth with protein , this will increase the level of ph and ice cream will start to glow .
we tested it in the last few months , and it seemed that the ideal would be to introduce him to halloween , because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect .
this is perhaps the most expensive ice creams from those that i did , because the jellyfish luminescence in four times more expensive than gold .
so every ball cost me about £ 140 .
but it is very pleasant to the taste .
experimental charlie company , based in bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and taste of mosaic gold flattened .
but his next creation should be even more ambitious .
he said : &quot; i want to develop invisible ice cream . &quot;
it is , by definition , is impossible because of the refraction caused crystals of ice , which is ice cream , but i think we will find a way to do it .
ice uses fluorescent properties of medusa , chinese scientists

snowden was willing to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany on the issue regarding u.s. intelligence
edward snowden , u.s. intelligence , has stated that he is ready to go to berlin to give a statement to the german parliament , if the us national security agency and its director keith alexander will not be able to answer questions about their activities .
german mp on thursday met with mr. in russia , where he has been granted asylum to discuss him giving testimony in germany .
in a letter from mr which mp introduced the media in berlin on friday , said : &quot; although the outcome of my effort was clearly positive , my government continues to treat dissent as treason , and seeks to criminalize political speech criminal accusations , which gives it no protection . &quot;
but speaking the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , mr. snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community can convince the us government to abandon criminal charges against him .
the charges made by the ministry of justice of the united states , include espionage and theft of state property .
hans-peter friedrich , the german interior minister , told zeit online : &quot; if mr. snowden ready to talk with german officials , we will find ways to make that possible . &quot;
relations between the united states and germany have become strained after claims that the nsa phone of chancellor angela merkel .
thomas opperman , mp , who chairs the parliamentary group , said that if there is a possibility to listen to mr. as witness , &quot; not exposing its dangers and not breaking relations with the united states fully &quot; , it must be used .
mr. , a member of parliament from the green party of germany , published his photograph with mr. in its twitter feed .
during a visit to russia , he was accompanied by two german journalists .
mr. said , according to the lawyer of former nsa , mr. snowden could return to russia if he left .
if mr. snowden gave testimony in germany , he would have needed guarantees that he will be there &quot; in security , &quot; said the mp .
mr snowden said in his letter that he faced &quot; tough and steady &quot; campaign of harassment , which forced him to leave his house .
however , he said that he had been inspired by the global response to his &quot; political statements &quot; .
citizens throughout the world , as well as senior officials - including the united states - have found that unchecked exposé of ubiquitous surveillance system useful for the society .
the letter contains the proposal to cooperate with german authorities , &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
foreign workers on 457 visas can be tested on &quot; authenticity . &quot;
the test of &quot; authenticity &quot; for foreign workers on 457 visas class is located on the examination of the government , because it means the extension of repressive measures .
this test , in case of its adoption , will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of the class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as loopholes to move the family and friends in australia .
the document submitted by the government of a discussion , was published today , while the former mp m. mcq attacked government rhetoric about foreign workers , saying that it might offend neighbors australia .
&quot; loud statements such as &quot; foreigners - at the end of the queue &quot; and &quot; first job &quot; represent a very nasty back to a time when unions demanded a protected labour market &quot; , she said to the institute of australia - india &quot; today .
historically , it meant that it was white labour needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact i wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
in the submitted for discussion document sets out 12 measures that had previously been considered by former immigration minister chris .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who was yesterday in sri lanka , where he meets with officials about the smuggling of people , has already made five of the recommended changes , and others are under consideration .
if the criteria of &quot; authenticity &quot; would be accepted , an applicant for a visa can be explored on the subject of &quot; whether a candidacy at a time when the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance the owner or person having the attitude towards financing the company . &quot;
the companies also may require a report on the number of holders of 457 visas , because the sooner businesses sponsor a small number of employees , then took on the job of hundreds .

the eu is preparing measures to support ukraine in case of economic pressure from russia .
the european union has a contingency plan to ensure ukraine &apos;s gas supplies , as well as to achieve an agreement with the imf about an emergency loan , if russia would take any action in response to the possible signing of the association agreement between the eu and ukraine on the vilnius summit .
with the imf negotiations about the loan , but another eu official directly involved in the negotiations , added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future .
at the same time , in addition to the potential loan from the imf , ukraine can get 610 million euros from the european union .
analysts polled by reuters , doubt that ukraine and the imf are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the conditions of financing .
do not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to receive aid , and the international rating agency s &amp; p on friday , ukraine &quot; s sovereign rating by one notch , to &quot; b- &quot; from &quot; b &quot; .
however , eu officials say the imf can show flexibility in terms of lending , taking into account the circumstances of ukraine .
in addition to the plan of financial support to the country , the eu has a fallback option for ensuring the supply of gas , the majority of whom now comes from russia .
perhaps it will be a gas from the &quot; nord stream &quot; or reverse from slovakia .
the latter , according to officials , is the most feasible and acceptable manner in the case of russia &quot; isolating ukraine &quot; .
analysts believe that this way of reverse supplies to ukraine can only be used within a few weeks , and is likely to lead to a reduction in supply to other regions .
&quot; between eu countries and ukrainians are held talks about how to create favourable conditions to ukraine could import gas from other sources , not from russia , or from the same source , but on other routes &quot; , added the source reuters .

italian workers with experience give way to the young
italian unemployment is breaking records .
data published on wednesday showed that without work now 12.5 % of the country &apos;s population .
the case was not so bad since the second world war .
this indicator is higher among the young in several times .
4 % of people aged 15 to 24 do not have employment .
in the opinion of the italian authorities , one of the solutions to this problem - the early retirement of older workers .
this is already the largest energy company of the country and adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of any pensions for workers with experience .
however , on the other hand , italy is a common problem for europe &quot; s ageing population .
and economists are unsure that affair with premature file rotation of personnel will redeem themselves .
syria destroyed equipment for
syria destroyed all of the declared capacity for the production of chemical weapons , recognized by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
this first stage of disarmament , damascus has completed a day before the deadline .
until november 1 , syria was supposed to destroy industrial and other auxiliary objects , intended to prepare the military for the use of toxic substances , reports the bbc .
the destruction of the stockpile of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014 .
according to a representative of the opcw , currently toxic substances found in repositories .
international inspectors went to syria after on the outskirts of damascus on 21 august in the chemical attack were killed , according to the united states , more than 1,400 people .
the main task of the inspectors did not lose time - to prevent the syrian authorities to produce more - and destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions depots .
behind these manufacturing facilities will now carefully watch to prevent their repairs .
the next milestone - the middle of november , by which time the opcw and syria must agree a detailed plan to destroy the existing stockpiles of toxic substances .
there are a lot of questions here .
where will they be destroyed ?
who will provide the equipment for this ?
all syrian statements will be carefully checked against western .
they readily advise inspectors new objects for testing , if there are grounds to suspect that damascus is not fully candid .
the united states believed that the shelling was conducted regular troops .
syria and russia insist that this was the work of the syrian rebels .
the world community has demanded from the syrian leadership is in accordance with the agreement reached under the mediation of russia - to destroy or lead in inoperable all capacity for the production of shells , toxic gases and liquids and for filling shells of these substances .
now , when this phase passed , the next step must be to destroy existing in the syrian army .
it is expected that this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances , mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places .
for its destruction is necessary to organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons and the syrian authorities for the agreed schedule of action - it is two weeks .
the head of field operations , opcw jerry smith told the bbc that his inspectors &quot; personally watched the destruction of equipment &quot; .
&quot; now they have no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons &quot; , he said .
in the statement , the opcw said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in syria and sure that factories on manufacture of shells and toxic substances , either destroyed or are in order .
the remaining two objects too dangerous to carry out an inspection , the document says , but the equipment was carried out and inspected by specialists of the opcw .
according to smith , the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production was &quot; particularly &quot; because he had to work in the ongoing conflict .
at the beginning of october , the opcw was awarded the nobel peace prize , however , according to smith , a time to celebrate that inspectors have not yet been found - they were too busy with work .
george : the gap with europe gives choice
another day , another about independence .
this time , we warn that an independent scotland should join the european area of free movement as a condition of eu membership .
it &apos;s the stories about passport control at the border with barbed wire along the shaft .
true , the newspaper pointed to possible economic benefits from the more liberal movements in the rest of europe , though - that predictably - it has not appeared in headlines .
nobody does not also pointed out that the eu member states spend a lot of time to rotate their formal rules as it is convenient .
because scotland now is not a member of the schengen zone , continued non-compliance with the requirements will become cheap concession for brussels in return for what he really wanted from the scots .
so it is not one worthy of attention .
and so old that she has become a descriptive of a hard : i first heard &quot; duck &quot; about what &quot; independence means passport control &quot; at least 40 years ago .
and yet there is an interesting moment , lost in the ancient tales .
why does an independent scotland should execute orders in europe ?
why change the yoke of london on the yoke of brussels , especially now ?
here is a real european news : the great postwar plan to unite europe finally stalled .
with the project &quot; europe &quot; is officially dead .
across the european union party , opposed to the eu , or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency , gaining strength .
even in germany , &quot; euro-skeptics party alternative for germany &quot; - founded only this year - appeared from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the september federal election , thus displacing essentially &quot; free democrats &quot; ( the equivalent of our &quot; liberal democrat &quot; ) from the bundestag .
there was always an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
nevertheless , the current economic crisis became a turning point .
austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the common currency have led many people to believe that &quot; europe &quot; has gone too far .
the euro crisis is connected with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits - it was true only for greece .
in fact , blocked its members on exchange rates , profitable for german exporters , is that german politicians and want to preserve .
without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency , southern europe is at a disadvantage in production capacities in comparison with germany .
the only remedy is to cut wages and public spending that are actively supported by berlin .
for the current budget problems and exchange worth the deeper problem of the productive capacities of europe .
as a result of measures to &quot; green &quot; energy introduced brussels - cipher , which means subsidies to french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers , european industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas than in the united states .
this unfavorable price terms , as we have already seen in .
no freezing wages in the world would not stop overwhelming victory of cheap shale gas in the united states over european petrochemical industry .
as a result , a revolt is brewing , especially in france , once the eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a way to control germany and put paris on a level with washington .
but berlin is no longer needed in paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy , and has already imposed its own economic policy of europe , leaving the destroyed economy of france in distress .
the result - right , acting against the eu party marine le pen of the national front , has just won the decisive run-off election by discarding the ruling party of socialists into third place .
&quot; the front line &quot; is now the most popular party in france , with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to british labour about how we should proceed from the assumption that the rift among the right-wing automatically have an impact in favor of the left .
what makes le pen with their newly inherited popularity among french white working class ?
she wants to use the elections to the eu in the next year to create a bloc in the european parliament against the eu and against the single currency .
if - and this is very likely - opposed to eu parties will receive support in these elections , the bloc will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the european parliament .
here is my opinion : soon the growing sentiment against the eu and against the single currency in europe merge together to destroy the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but he again becomes something of a vague &quot; europe ( sovereign ) nations , &quot; which like general de gaulle .
germany and several of her dependent economies can keep the euro , but france and southern europe will restore its own currency .
i assume that britain distances himself from the project , hoping to get closer to the united states .
nevertheless , the growing interest from washington to the pacific ocean indicates the likelihood that britain will be left without attention in cold atlantic .
in what position it leaves scotland ?
we can choose to become a region ( essentially ) of england .
or we can protect their own economic interests , which means , among other things , to send in berlin and brussels to hell in a handbasket .
i suspect that scotland can succeed in the freer european agreement provided that we will keep its currency .
cooperation with other nations will be easier in europe .
otherwise , we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of norway and preserve our economic independence .
the government of the scottish national party in scotland is - ironically - the most successful political movement in europe , and against the austerity measures , which received a majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts , proposed and implemented ) labour chancellor of the exchequer aleister and subsequently the coalition of tories and liberal democrats .
scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence , only to accept austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .

early puberty : aging earlier
and latin american girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white , research shows .
physical changes do not mean that puberty close
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals to blame
experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the launch mechanisms of early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is not so expressed boys
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
whether the mother whether to be frightened if her daughter begin to form the beginnings of breast and pubic hair grow at 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , a children &apos;s doctor , paul explained that these early physical changes is quite common among american girls and represent a new norm .
&quot; i spend a lot of time , calming parents - usually it does not mean rapid onset of the full sexual maturity , &quot; he said .
obvious signs of development , such as growing breasts and pubic hair and body odor , appear earlier in girls .
but it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche ( first period ) over the last four decades .
in the united states , the average age of 12.5 years and declined when compared with 12,75 in 1970 .
&quot; after chest begins to develop , is at least two to three years before menarche &quot; , - said , is also the author of &quot; early puberty in girls : how to cope with this widespread problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate check of how sexual maturation will prosper .
there is debate about what constitutes an offensive sexual maturity , but is considered &quot; premature &quot; when breast augmentation has been accompanied by a sharp rise in growth to 8 years .
in most cases , the process will slow or be - that is what the pediatrician can monitor carefully .
more rapid progress can serve as the basis for analyses , to prevent serious problems , such as a tumor or cyst .
there are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence : premature aging of the bones , which ultimately can lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood .
recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child , the level of development , growth rates and emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
cautious with drugs , but admits that &quot; the suppression of puberty might mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers . &quot;
another big problem is clear : parents simply do not want to have their very young daughters were menstruation .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy , or even how they cope with hygiene issues , &quot; he said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman , the daughter of a menstrual period started in 10 years .
while there were signs , and we talked about menstruation , she was not emotionally ready .
she came home from school , fearful and broken because it first among his friends .
there are many theories about the causes of early puberty .
nevertheless , there is no consistent evidence that to blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media .
boys - as well as girls , puberty begins earlier .
argues that the premise , which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 , he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years , which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty .
other data confirm this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country , and latin american girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white .
there are various explanations .
globally , on early puberty , apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes .
another mystery : although boys hair on the face and to appear at younger ages , a trend towards total early sex it is not as pronounced as in girls .
other physicians participating in the conference of the aap , confirmed the complexity of this theme .
the emergence of pimples and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of nursery age .
&quot; we must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty , &quot; said dr. laurence silverman , kids in the hospital in the town of morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child .
&quot; it may mean an earlier than expected , conversation , &quot; he explained .
if you keep calm , your child normally reacts well .
girls who blossom early , we need proof that even when it happens early , this process is a normal part of life .

halloween 2013 in numbers
when i was little , halloween was magical .
with his sister being allowed to eat candy , not to go to bed late and to masquerade for our area .
i am now more on .
i am not in the past two years , distribute candy in his apartment and will likely not begin this year .
however , statistics show that i am a white crow in regard to halloween .
according to the national retail federation , the majority of americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate halloween this year , and spend a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes , and decorations .
the only thing i am waiting every halloween is trending .
the national retail federation predicts that the suits will be spent $ 1.2 billion from $ 6.9 billion .
this year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects .
women no longer need to be from sexual professions ; they can also be sexual food , for example , or pizza .
as for the men , i think we will see a lot of thanks to the &quot; zombie &quot; , and i am confident that astronauts in the style of the band daft punk will get in our tapes 11 this year .
according to google , the costumes , which are most often is zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
perhaps , there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach .
we have our dogs in the past year and , to my surprise , we were not the only ones .
moreover , according to the national retail federation , americans spend this year , $ 330 million on costumes for pets .
this means a lot of funny .
when it comes to sweets , we do not .
americans spend their $ 1.9 billion this year , according to nielsen .
it is about 600 million pounds of candy bars , sweets , milk , chew sweets and bars clark bar .
according to the u.s. department of commerce , which is excellent news for demanding sweets 41 million children who got ready to conquer our areas .
moreover , we will buy , and - let us not deceive ourselves - we may eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during halloween .
the only thing that we do not want to consume is candy in the form of corn seeds ; and yet , according to the national confectioners association , nearly 35 million pounds of them sold for halloween .
this is about 9 billion individual corn .
this puzzle , which i still have to discern .
nothing expresses the essence of halloween as a haunted house .
they have impressive names , such as &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , &quot; whine and cry &quot; and &quot; house of shock . &quot;
moreover , according to the society of america , in america , there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses , generating about $ 500 million in revenue , as well as the stunning photos where you almost that your friend posted on facebook , and you can not remove , and then the guy who you like , sees this picture and leave a comment like &quot; cool expression . &quot;
finally talk about pumpkins .
charlie brown introduced us to the great when we were children , and cutting lamp jack - is like a christmas tree ornament , what we do since childhood .
fortunately for us , the fashion on the child began only in the past year thanks to , so most of us have grown , the carved pumpkin instead of sitting in them .
according to the united states census bureau , this year americans spend about $ 106 million on the pumpkin .
jack-o &apos; -lantern , slowly drying on your porch , probably arrived from illinois , who raised this year , 542 million pounds of pumpkin .
if you want to visit a task even harder than , tim and susan in the town of napa valley in california and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing in 2032 lbs .

the owners of pawn shops in singapore is doing well , while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
in lombard in the shopping center in singapore lays a gold bracelet , ring and earrings to pay for the education of his daughter .
&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house so that all my money is invested over there , &quot; said ms ..
although she &apos;s earning $ 3,000 ( $ 2,400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband also works , a monthly family income is not enough , she says .
indeed , the demand in various parts of southeast asia - where the debt of households is growing - is that , where she conducts her deal this week became the third registered on the singapore stock exchange .
credit under pledge of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money ( s $ 1,300 in the case of ms. ) , but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
usually there are pawnbrokers in singapore , an effective annual interest rates at 17 percent - slightly above the 15.4 % offered in the united overseas bank , a local lender , with a branch in the same shopping center .
however , pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or evidence of wage and can give loans faster than banks .
however , millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers , because families are feeling the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth , following the global financial crisis , and cheap credit , loose monetary policy in advanced economies , low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to offset a reduction in profits as the slowing growth of their economies .
this week , standard &amp; poor &quot; s , the rating agency , indicated an increase in household leverage , mainly due to the growth in the mortgage as a risk factor for creditworthiness of asian banks .
it announced that malaysia , thailand and singapore have the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in asia .
malaysia topped the list with 80 % of gdp , compared with 60 % in 2008 .
economists are also concerned at the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week barely emerged from technical recession .
on thursday , data showed continued declining exports and weakening consumer demand .
&quot; the bottom line is that people with higher prices in the middle and bottom of the income scale &#93; &#91; will look for ways to supplement their incomes where only they can , &quot; says song , an economist , a malaysian bank .
record high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the ibsc board with which people lay their personal belongings as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry .
in singapore , about 70 % of the things contained in 200 points city-state , are gold products .
people say : &quot; the price of gold looks good , let us gold chain of grandmothers and get it back in the next month . &quot;
in thailand , the largest operator of pawn shops saw growth in the number of customers using its branches in recent months , up to 20 % .
growth in business is such that , the operator of branches in and 15 other similar in singapore , plans to expand not only in neighboring malaysia , where it has four stores , but also outside of asia , too , says lee ching , executive director .
the company will finance the expansion , using 60 percent of s $ 66 million raised this week as a result of placement of shares on the stock market in singapore .
while some lenders have sparked the fire of criticism because of high interest rates , ms lombard says that not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not increase the debt directly .
&quot; clients lay items which they already possess , and commercialization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households , &quot; she says .
bet wins wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding .
and at the same time enjoy not only those categories of people who are in dire financial straits .
rich people in singapore also use branches , laying gold bars or a rolex , who can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash .
we are seeing clients from all sectors of society .
&quot; they include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments , or small businesses that must be overcome temporary financial difficulties , &quot; said ms ..
sometimes they just need money very quickly .

bashkiria in the course of public procurement interventions can put grain on the auction until the beginning of 2014 , said minister of agriculture of the republic of nikolay kovalenko .
today , the market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales in the fund .
while the market price is higher , and there is demand .
&quot; maybe the grain will be put up for auction after the new year &quot; , he said at yesterday &apos;s press conference .
the minister recalled that in the current year , crops crops for the harvest of 2013 amounted to $ 3.1 million hectares , including in the area of crops - 1.7 million hectares , that is by 3,3 % more than last year .
under the 2014 harvest 550 thousand hectares ( 105 thousand ha more than in 2012 ) .
increased the area under wheat , rye and triticale remained at the same level .

the clink of glass rushed transport police officer and security guard chop &quot; russian railways &quot; .
they managed to delay an intruder trying to escape from the scene .
employees of the ministry of interior of russia , south-eastern lu is checked .
the question of the criminal case , said senior members of the media and public relations southeast lu of the russian ministry of internal affairs on transport sergey .
russia &apos;s security officials know nothing about the group &quot; fraternal circle &quot; - novye izvestia
writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the russian federation .
&quot; after reports appeared in the media about the case by the u.s. treasury in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the eurasian criminal &apos; fraternal circle &apos; , we looked at all the databases , but the group is not found &quot; , said the priest .
in his opinion , the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called russian mafia , which allegedly operates abroad .
as mentioned earlier , &quot; neither &quot; , yesterday the us treasury has published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal gang &quot; fraternal circle &quot; .
among them was named , and the russian singer grigori leps .
he was featured in the list as &quot; grisha &quot; posted the day before .
with these popular russian singer they coincide .
specified the exact name is grigory , creative name , place and date of birth .
in addition , there are still five people mentioned .
two russians , an israeli citizen , a citizen of uzbekistan and another origin from the former ussr , whose nationality is not specified .
in the united states , confident that grigory leps , which lives on the island of phuket for bandits transported money at their request .
to this was attached a photo of singer and include all its data , which correspond to reality .
moreover , leps , indeed , recently bought a house in phuket .
the fbi noted that they intend to impose sanctions on .
entry to the man in black lists of american finance entails blocking his assets in the united states and a ban on business contacts with him persons residing in the united states .
assistant maya stated that no notifications to the singer himself was forthcoming : &quot; it is difficult to answer the question of whether it is the gregory , about which everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the united states &quot; .
everyone knows that leps is information media .
officially to him personally , there was no notification , although i do not know whether they are in such cases .
&quot; and , of course , this is all on the one hand , funny and , on the other hand , is surprising and unexpected &quot; , she told ria novosti .
according to her , in phuket grigory leps does not live , but , as the finance ministry argues the u.s. house on thai island , it really is .
she said that leps is now in a long tour to the far east and siberia , and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of blagoveshchensk .
black box in your car ?
while the american designers roads trying to find money to repair highways system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box , neatly on the dashboard of your car .
these devices , tracking every mile and transmit this information to officials , are at the center of the controversial attempts to modernize the antiquated system of financing the highways of america organized routine bodies of washington state .
usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and picturesque alliances .
libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the rights of small to track the number of miles you and even , perhaps , where you drive them , &quot; and then use this information when drawing up the tax bills .
tea party movement shocked .
the american civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life .
although congress until may agree to continue or not , several states are not going to wait .
they ponder how over the next decade , you can go to the system , under which drivers pay for each mile road , which they can ride .
thousands of motorists had taken on the testing of these black boxes , some of which have a function of satellite tracking .
it is really necessary for our country .
&quot; this is not an issue on which we have may be the right choice , &quot; said hassan , executive director of the southern california association of governments , which prepares plans to start tracking the state authorities miles every californian , by 2025 .
there will be changes in how we pay these taxes .
the technology to do this already exists .
the need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds from the government fund the construction of highways , funded by taxes that americans pay for .
americans have been buying as much gasoline as before .
cars passing more miles per gallon .
the federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon , has not appreciated for 20 years .
politicians do not want to raise tax on even one penny with high prices for gasoline .
&quot; a tax on gasoline simply impossible to maintain , &quot; said lee , an expert on transport policy at the university of minnesota .
in his state was recently installed on the cars 500 tracking devices for testing the system of payment .
&quot; it would be the best option in the long run , &quot; he said .
the beggar call this user fee .
not surprisingly , this idea appeals to urban liberals , because with the help of taxes can be changed the nature of travel for reducing the load of roads and greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
the authorities in california could be waiting for this system in the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming .
but a republican member of the house of representatives bill shuster ( pa ) , chairman of the transportation committee of the chamber of commerce , said that he , too , sees the system as the most viable long-term alternatives .
proponents of the free market in the fund &quot; reason &quot; is also delighted from what drivers would pay for each mile .
&quot; this is not just a tax that will go into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president of political affairs of reason .
people directly pay for what they receive .
this movement is also supported by two former transport ministers of the united states , which in 2011 urged congress to move in the direction of the payment .
the us senate approved last year a pilot project at a cost of 90 million dollars , which would have involved about 10,000 cars .
however , the leaders of the house of representatives rejected this proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters whom in everyday life often come many miles to get to work or to the city .
a few states and cities , nevertheless , go on this path independently .
the greatest enthusiasm is manifested in oregon , where to participate in the largest experiment in the country held 5,000 drivers .
these drivers will soon be paying staff for miles driven instead of the gasoline tax .
in nevada , a pilot project has been completed .
he is seen in new york .
illinois it on a limited basis involving trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes transportation departments 17 east coast states ( including maryland , and florida ) , studying how they can spend these changes .
this concept has not received universal acceptance .
in nevada , where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices , drivers were worried that the government can track their every step .
&quot; concern about &quot; big brother &quot; and similar things represents a big problem , &quot; said khan , head of the issues of strategy and performance management in the department of transport in nevada .
it was not what people wanted .
when the tests were underway , a branch of the american civil liberties union in nevada warned on its website : &quot; will be very easy to convert these devices into full-fledged tracking devices . &quot;
there is no need to create a huge , huge technological infrastructure , which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about everyday movements of individual citizens .
nevada is one of several states where we are soul searching low-cost technology that would have allowed state authorities to engage in accounting driving miles , but no information about the place and time .
if you can do it , &quot; said khan , the society will feel more relaxed .
the search for this technology led some state agencies to a small , young company in california called true .
initially , the company has been attempting to collect state taxes .
she sought to enter the booming market of automobile insurance , in which drivers pay based on mileage .
but the device , which it began testing , attract designers roads because they do not use gps and provide a limited amount of information , periodically downloadable via modem .
&quot; people are more inclined to do it if you do not track their speed and do not track their location , &quot; said ryan morrison , executive director of true .
there were several big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state .
there is much less expensive and less recurring ways to do it .
in oregon designers are experimenting with granting drivers of different options .
they can choose the device with or without gps .
or they could just abandon devices , deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles , which can ride all the residents of the state .
in other places , they hope to sell the idea to the public , forcing the device to do more , not less .
in new york city transportation officials are seeking to develop a device that will also take payment for parking lot meters , to provide &quot; pay as &quot; insurance pool and gather data on the speed in the real-time mode from the other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams .
&quot; motorists will attract the participation of the benefits they offer , &quot; the document says urban design .
some designers transport systems , however , think about whether all the talk of paying just a giant a distraction .
in the urban transport commission in the san francisco bay area officials say that congress could very easily overcome bankruptcy trust fund for the construction of highways , raising taxes on gasoline .
an additional lump sum or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgical intervention , when all you need to do is take an aspirin , &quot; said randy , director of the commission on legislation and public relations .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life , and many other things .
pope francis named the first cardinals in february
pope francis in san raise new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time of his service on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the senior clergy in the catholic church after the pope , and they elect popes , so francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will participate in the choice of his successor .
currently there are 201 cardinal .
however , after the cardinal 80th age he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - this is a prerogative of the group &quot; 120 &quot; .
announcing the news , vatican spokesman father federico lombardi said that before the ceremony of the assembly will be held in san all current cardinals , known as .
&quot; pope francis has decided to inform us of their decision to convene in february in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from all over the world &quot; , said lombardi .
jack valero of the catholic voices , &quot; said that by february , the number is likely to fall .
he said that usually the pope calls cardinals as much as necessary to again bring the number to 120 , as well as many cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses .
the next year will be very important because it will be the first since the election of francis , in march of this year , according to valero .
at the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of europe and especially in favor of italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of catholics live in south america , but they are insignificant number of cardinals .
it will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the council of cardinals francis - the group of eight cardinals from around the world , which is to seek ways of reforming the church .
in the past , the pope all solved independently .
&quot; now , francis chose eight cardinals to help him &quot; , valero said .
he said that it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that francis will turn to for advice .
but we have not been in this situation before that - all this for us for the first time .

the tax for foreign property owners will cause london bubble bursts
the treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the measures for the tax on capital gains , but awaits a final decision from mr osborne , who in 2012 budget introduced the rate of state duty in the amount of 7 % for houses worth more than £ 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership , not as individuals .
at the moment the residential real estate in parts of westminster , kensington and chelsea , rose from 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 financial year already exceeds the total amount in northern ireland , wales , scotland , the northeast , the northwest , and taken together .
mr cooke said : &quot; after an increase of state duty for expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive properties is undervalued regardless of the impact of outdated municipal tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move may cause some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in london or its current owners do not want to sell it , &quot; he added .
the cost of a first-class property - the top 5 - 10 % of the housing market at a price - in the affluent south-west london belt , which stretches from until wimbledon , increased by a record 11.8 % over the past year .
according to the company , the prices in central london continued to demonstrate strong growth at a rate of 5.6 % year on year , but their eclipsed actively developing the domestic market &quot; with the surge of prices in the southwest , in the north ( 7.4 % ) and in the east ( 6.5 % ) of the city .
the next meeting of the association of mechanicians of tyumen region took place on the basis of the automobile plant .
in the framework of the event the presentation the new production line of longitudinal pipes made of steel .
as narrated the commercial director of enterprise denis , in 2011 , with the emergence of a new owner conducted marketing research to study the market for steel structures in the tyumen region .
it turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons line pipes per month .
after that it was decided to change the profile of the factory and installation of the equipment for their production .
already this year dispatched more than 7 thousand tons of total production .
investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million , &quot; said denis .
in october , launched a new mill , which allows to increase the range .
the plant produces a fine profile of pipes , which is used for agriculture , small forms of construction and furniture industries , as well as large - for the construction industry .
plan to reach a production level of 50 thousand tons of production per year , which would be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the tyumen region .
despite the transition to another activity , the number of employees at the plant have not decreased - now it is 157 people in plans for the purchase of new equipment , increasing staff still more than 50 employees .
at the enterprise there is a retraining of the staff , and the necessary experts chosen from existing .
next year we plan to introduce the new unit slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimetres , which allows to reduce prime cost of the products , as well as another camp , with the speed of production of pipes to 47 meters per minute .
by the end of 2014 , the company collected to master production of pipes , which are used in the housing and public utility sector .
the company aims to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the tyumen region in this production .
the deputy director of the department for the investment policy leonid , referring to the leaders of manufacturing , advised to focus on modernization of machine-building enterprises .
to this aim and forms of state support for the industry , which include compensation for interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and expenses on his lease .
in the current year for these purposes provided $ 150 million rubles , two-thirds of that amount has already been spent .
the latest commission , which will review contracts , subsidies , taking documents from enterprises until 15 november .
in addition , the budget are reimbursed expenses for the participation of local manufacturers in international fairs .
for the next year the budget provides the means of 150 million rubles , which can be used to offset leasing payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment .
5 million will be allocated to participate in fairs , 3 million - on energy efficiency programme .
reduced to 72 million roubles of funds for the compensation ordered and purchased equipment , which is produced in the south of tyumen region for oil and gas complex .
according to leonid , in the long term , this form of support will be stopped , as the reason for its introduction was compensation for the mining tax , which oil companies pay the regional budget .
currently they do not and subsidies are direct supply obligations in the region .
in view of this , the government believes that directly support the priority of industrial enterprises , not funding through the oil industry .
aid budget will be associated with investment projects which will be implemented on the production .
many company managers had expressed concern in connection with the situation in relations with .
bailout on their equipment is the competitive advantage of industry south of tyumen region , and with its repeal is hard to compete on price with an average strip of russia , where more than cheap labor .
in addition , unclear the question with a succession of new owner of tnk-bp - company rosneft , which has so far not place their orders for the tyumen region enterprises .
the agreement on implementation of the uvat project expires in 2013 , and his request for an extension was not received .
currently , the enterprise south area who specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector , could not build a portfolio of orders for the next year .
it remains an open question whether taxes will come from the oil produced in the area in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of deposits .

syria has destroyed their funds producing chemical weapons , says watchdog group
syria has destroyed the main equipment for producing chemical weapons and ammunition with poisoning gas , said on thursday the international watchdog group , while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country , close to one of the objects , which are believed to be stored toxic substances .
also on thursday , a group of syrian activists said that more than 120 000 people were killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago .
the statement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons was made one day before
the deadline of 1 november , installed this organisation based in the hague to damascus destroyed or &quot; made &quot; all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow you to mix chemicals with obtaining poison gas and filling them with ammunition .
the completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable , which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of damascus by the middle of 2014 .
the destruction of the equipment means that syria can no longer make new chemical weapons .
nevertheless , damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies .
the country is believed to have roughly 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents and weapons , including agents mustard gas and make nerve gas sarin .
this statement was made during fighting on thursday in the town of al-safira , which experts say is the facility for the production of chemical weapons , as well as the location of his store , reports based in britain , the syrian center for human rights .
the group of activists , which watched the loss through a network of activists in syria , said on thursday that killed 120 296 people .
of this number , as it was said , 61 067 6365 are civilians , including children .
on the part of the government , said the group , 29 954 people are members of the armed forces of president bashar assad , 18 678 are pro-government fighters and 187 - lebanese hezbollah militants .
also among those killed , as stated in the statement were presented army defector and about 5375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
according to un estimates , from july 25 , 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since march 2011 .
since then this figure did not update .
the conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country .
assad &quot; s forces fought in several weeks with the insurgents , many of whom are linked to al qaeda groups .
the center said thursday there were casualties on both sides , but did not give a specific data .
the fighting underlined the dangers faced by inspectors on chemical weapons , perhaps within the tight schedule of its mission in syria &quot; s deliverance from toxic arsenal , in the midst of the ongoing civil war .
in a statement released by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons , which is working in close cooperation with the united nations , said that her team was &quot; now satisfied with the fact that she is tested and seen swept away all the declared syria critically important means of production and mixing / filling equipment . &quot;
she added that &quot; no additional inspection activities are not currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspectors said they completed the first round of testing , having visited 21 of the 23 sites damascus declared .
they were not able to visit two places for security reasons , said the inspectors .
on thursday , the opcw said that both places were , according to syria , &quot; abandoned and ... the objects of the program of chemical weapons stored in them , were relocated to other declared places which have been verified . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the object was in one of two places , which opcw inspectors have been unable to visit .
syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of their chemical weapons , which should be approved next month , the executive committee of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
&quot; i salute the courage and bravery that you all have shown in the most complex mission ever attempted this organization , &quot; said the director general ahmet observer group in comments published by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
already the third year of the civil war the rebels , mostly sunni muslims , with the government of assad and his security forces , which are composed of members of his alawite sect , a branch of shia islam .
as for other events , the head of the centre rami abdurrahman said that was a strong explosion on wednesday at the site of syria &quot; s air defenses in the coastal province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion is unknown , he said .
message : obama &quot; s pre-election headquarters regarded the exclusion of biden in favor of hillary clinton
according to the new york times , president barack obama &quot; s closest advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing vice president joe biden candidacy of hillary clinton in the electoral list of 2012 .
this discovery is the most spectacular sensation of all expected books mark galperin and john on campaign 2012 &quot; rates : game change 2012 &quot; .
the publication of the times received a copy of an exit of the book and reported on thursday night that the next president &quot; s assistants had conducted &quot; large-scale research in a focus group and opinion polls at the end of 2011 , &quot; to assess whether the exclusion of biden to help raise hopes for obama &quot; s re-election .
according to the political observer the times &apos;s jonathan martin , the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials , campaign staff and white house , namely the former white house chief of staff bill daley , to assess what effect will vote on the appointment of former secretary of state clinton vice president .
possible replacement was a secret , carefully guarded election headquarters in chicago and in the oval office .
only six of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including jim daly , the former head of obama &quot; s campaign staff and former senior white house advisers david and david - knew that replacement considered .
the book &quot; bets &quot; argues that daly was the initiator attempts to replace biden , despite their &quot; close personal relationship &quot; , but ultimately abandoned this step when their data showed that adding clinton to the electoral list is not &quot; significantly improve obama &quot; s chances . &quot;
in an interview with martin daly confirmed that the administration really considered a possibility to replace biden clinton .
&quot; i am actively addressed during the consideration of many things , and this was one of them , &quot; said the daily newspaper .
you must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape , so we thought : &quot; oh god , what do we do ? &quot;
although daly described the study as a &quot; necessary checks , &quot; martin told cnn that anderson representative election staff enough was invested in the study of whether this step will bring dividends in the vote .
&quot; campaign headquarters not spending such sums of money on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider something seriously , &quot; said martin in ak 360 program .
it is unclear , however , whether obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacement .
martin told cnn that he asked daly knew whether his then boss about possible .
although daly and said that he did not think the president &quot; was aware &quot; of a possible replacement , the former head of the administration acknowledged that &quot; perhaps , &quot; obama knew .
martin added that &quot; rates &quot; would not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results reached political sensing before obama &quot; s table .
cooper asked martin if he seriously thinks that obama did not know about the research capabilities of the excluded biden from the electoral list .
&quot; perhaps , &quot; martin replied .

legislative bans forced russians to drink less beer
the russian beer in a bad mood .
according to them , the consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level , and it is at best .
although businessmen initially counted on growth .
for the current year is for them to fail : sales fell by 7 per cent .
all this has told the head of one of the largest beer companies in the country , chairman of the union of russian beer isaac at iii annual conference of the institute of adam smith &quot; commodities of daily demand in russia &quot; , which just ended in moscow .
it discussed the state regulation of the market .
from 2008 to 2012 , the russian beer market has shrunk by 18 per cent , because in recent years , the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content , &quot; he told listeners .
in no country in the world is not such a hard limit beer market , unpredictable introducing more and more bans , which allegedly struggles with alcohol abuse .
brewer complained that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse , does not have special influence , yet constantly emerge all the new initiatives .
most of all the producers of beer struck introduced since this year the ban on selling alcohol at kiosks .
&quot; we just lost 35 thousand consumers &quot; , said isaac .
for the next year at two beer forecast .
optimistic - he spoke : the sale of the drink will be kept at the same level .
pessimistic - fall for another 2-3 per cent .
to maintain their profit , businessmen are forced to quit from varieties designed for mass-market consumer , in a class of &quot; premium &quot; beer , will become less , but it will be more expensive .
meanwhile , the radical consequences from falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not visible .
&quot; on my observations , the level of alcoholism is still roughly at the same level &quot; , said alexei captains of hundreds .
true , increased the proportion of patients who use surrogates alcoholic drinks , as well as those who &quot; sat down &quot; for drinks like &quot; jaguar &quot; , whereas 10 years ago it prevailed &quot; beer &quot; alcoholism .
why would the construction of the tpu in moscow
every year the capital authorities promise to arrange more nodes ( tpu ) .
it is planned to enter into operation till 2020 255 tpu .
what actually is the project dealt our correspondent .
a couple of months ago , the metro &quot; smolensk &quot; line was a construction fence .
the caption read , that arrangement is the project &quot; s funding has node .
it was all very strange , because alongside &quot; smolensk &quot; no land transport does not stop and , therefore , cannot change to him .
to get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the garden ring , one must overcome about 130 meters , including ground transition through the lane .
now the &quot; smolensk &quot; almost all finished .
faded flower stall , stand for newspapers , and the asphalt before entering followed .
here is the entire transport junction .
there are hosts and capital - explain in the press service of the moscow department of transport .
capital will not yet .
but suppose the construction of parking , the withdrawal of shopping sites , hindering the movement of passengers , the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment .
actually , tpu even engaged in no forwarding company and professional overhaul of department of the city of moscow .
hub is not necessarily a complicated design , &quot; explains director of the institute of economics of transport and the transport policy of the higher school of economics , mikhail .
sometimes you need a roof over your head and board , about the time of arrival of transport .
here , for example , of the metro &quot; yasenevo &quot; recently opened a full interchange node .
let no canopies , but with car parks and the scoreboard , indicating when придет bus .
but in the pursuit of the record number of officials at tpu absolutely everything .
back in 2011 , the city had planned to build for everything 151 node , 59 of them with capital construction .
now the plans before 2020 are already 255 tpu .
some 200 of them promise to pass it this year .
although the city has the program of development of tpu , otherwise no qualitative criteria , &quot; notes alexander morozov , co-chairman of the public organization &quot; the town and transport . &quot;
report on the number of objects , but the quality of transplants on each of them often worsens .
the criteria , according to the expert , should be two : first - cutting the time of transplant , secondly - convenience .
above all , the opportunity to change the type of transport , not going out in the rain .
in moscow the same arrangement of tpu sometimes goes exactly the opposite .
a vivid example of the &quot; vdnh &quot; metro station .
earlier , commuter buses with yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance of the exhibition .
now their stops were postponed to the opposite side of the street of cosmonauts .
farther from the subway , much further from , but closer to residential homes .
the gift that residents do not want bus under windows and complained in every possible instance .
capital tpu in moscow is somehow not immediately .
the first of them started five years ago at metro &quot; planernaya &quot; .
the project was designed to be a model .
and it really is a sample of how interchange node , left to investors , turns into a banal shopping mall .
no , there is for buses , canopy not to go from the subway in the rain , and three floors of parking lots .
true , no. 202 and no. 203 in the moscow tpu places gave no brand .
as strangers they pushed them away from the metro .
but space under trade more left .
one of only 32 clothing store , but generally there is almost everything - from pet products to the showroom .
well , in fact , suddenly from bus passengers who need to buy a new car on the road ?
we have when they build overhaul tpu , somehow always turns out shopping mall .
recently , the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of the car parks decided to give at the market .
now , on the third floor of the tpu &quot; planernaya &quot; among the floor parking spaces is trade .
vegetables , spices , chinese jeans , not russian speech and guards , glinting on our photographer .
interchange knot finally turned into a bazaar .
the fact is that before the metro &quot; planernaya &quot; market , but it was demolished .
and in the prefecture of traffickers and everything within dui allowed on parking node .
anyway , owing to the high prices there is always empty .
the same funny that the market demolished in order to build in its place ... new tpu .
this is castling .
the metro &quot; kaluga &quot; distance approach from lobby metro bus was 50 meters , &quot; said alexander morozov .
after the construction of the trade center , allegedly tpu , the distance increased to 170 meters .
to sit in the bus , you need to pass through the shopping centre .
after 22 hours , when it is closed , must work around him under the open sky .
however , the &quot; design &quot; and &quot; kaluga &quot; will soon seem the problem .
in mid-september , the commission approved the mayor planning solutions for the first eight capital tpu .
four of them will 25-этажными , not counting two or three underground floors .
the chief monster will grow from metro station &quot; tushino district &quot; , there will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space .
representatives of railway stations directorate of russian railways , responsible for the construction of the tpu from metro , have already told journalists : in future will contain shops , hotels and apartments .
at the same time , officials assure that storied parking zay ­ mut from one third to a half of the square .
take for example the &quot; folk &quot; garages .
for example , the garage for 258 , which recently built on the international street , has an area of 8015 square meters .
so for parking in 2.6 thousand cars , &quot; &quot; need about 80 thousand &quot; squares &quot; .
this is less than a third of that which they intend to build .
let one or two go on various floors for buses .
remains of at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate .
and this , on the minute , almost two of gum .
if capital tpu in stations and build the railroad station , the remaining sites will develop .
they also promised that &quot; there will be a lot of functional purpose &quot; , including hotels , offices and even sports halls .
by the way , in the moscow department of property recently , told reporters that develop the draft resolution , according to which investors would be able to apply for a plot for tpu to officials directly .
without any competitions .
because , they say , that transport issues for the city - a priority .
the ideal tpu is , for example , the &quot; harvard &quot; in boston , or &quot; &quot; in toronto , &quot; says alexander morozov .
there , trolleys and trams descend under the earth on the subway and the distance from the subway car approach before the tram is only 50 metres without entering into the street .
around no unnecessary trade .
but moscow officials throws in the extreme .
either nothing will build , or even 25 storeys with offices and apartments .

bombardier profit declines with falling supply and quantity of orders for planes
corporation of bombardier , the canadian aircraft and train maker , reported on thursday about the reduction of net profit by 15 per cent under the influence of a number of orders and deliveries aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit .
located in montreal , bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new cseries aircraft and provided no new information about whether implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation by next september .
after the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft , held approximately one and a half months ago , he was still only three times , that raises questions about whether testing phase on schedule .
no results were acquitted forecasts and led to the downfall of the shares by more than 8 per cent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron , analyst at national bank financial , on thursday lowered its estimate of &quot; above &quot; to &quot; restricted &quot; because of the belief that growth stocks in the next quarter or two .
&quot; although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was largely predictable , we are , of course , disappointed by the performance of profit transport department &quot; , - said the review of the stock market .
we believe that bombardier gets new cseries orders as the flight test program .
nevertheless , if not in the coming months will be announced about new orders , we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program .
bombardier cseries family of aircraft hopes will enable it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market , which is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first prototype aircraft was introduced in march , and for the first time made flying in september after several months of delay .
but firm orders for the cseries has so far not too many - 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company &quot; s claims about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner .
just now there are 403 15 orders and agreements with the customers and operators .
chief executive officer pierre was confident that bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders to the moment when the first plane will be launched into commercial operation .
on thursday , executives also assured analysts and media that the program is progressing according to plan .
&quot; a test model of the aircraft had not stayed on the ground longer than expected , &quot; he said during a conference call , adding that the downtime of the airplane were planned ground tests and software updates .
all manufacturers plan to test differently .
we decided to spend the first flight and make a break for updates , so we did .
so will occur during the flight test program .
the second of five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks , and all the others will soon follow him as the company said .
still , analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first client could begin to operate the cseries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier said that it evaluates the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months .
&quot; the slow pace of flight testing - though , apparently , and corresponds to the domestic schedule bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; he said .
in the third quarter , september 30 , net income bombardier has declined to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , last year .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged - 9 cents .
gross income fell slightly - from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .
analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .

jenny slate has joined the cast as a &quot; saturday night live &quot; and &quot; parks and recreation , &quot; though most of all she is known for a series of viral videos &quot; marseille - in boots . &quot;
and krall and slate , like other young the comedians with original style ( pessimistic anthony , the crafty , focused on racial themes mau bell ) - this is the result of a decentralized world of american comedy .
