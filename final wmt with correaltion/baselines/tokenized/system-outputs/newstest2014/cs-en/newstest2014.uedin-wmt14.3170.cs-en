egypt in the office of the first freely elected president
muhammad mursí folded the inaugural oath , but his triumphant day hard to close the political unrest in egypt .
islamista muhammad mursí promised a &quot; new egypt , &quot; when he was formally sworn into office as the first freely elected president of the country after hosni mubarak , who was deposed by 16 months earlier .
in his inauguration before the high constitutional court , mursí also became the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the fifth egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he took an oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes in the mansion built overlooking the nile , which resembles an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; usilujeme a better tomorrow , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; he said in a solemn ceremony mursí fhat live on national television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said mursí , a 60-year-old engineer trained in the us and a member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been for most of the 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization , the target of fierce attacks by individual governments .
when mursí shortly after 11 p.m. local time arrived in a small convoy of cars , guarded the building hundreds of soldiers and police officers .
only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to celebrate the president , and unlike the presidential pomp of mubarak &apos;s office was only briefly stopped traffic to pass the column usually a busy road linking the city centre to the suburbs to the south .
personal prestige mursího , derisively known as necharismatická &quot; spare tire &quot; of the muslim brotherhood , has risen sharply since his victory and his friday speech , which was designed to present him as a candidate of islamists , but also to all those who want to lead to the end of the revolt against the authoritarian mubarak .
&quot; egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; said mursí , dressed in a blue jacket with a red tie judges in the wood-paneled chamber , where he took the oath .
mursí later traveled to cairo university , where he was to deliver the inaugural speech .
while he stood at attention , received an official welcome from the military band , which played the national anthem .
he was a military leader , field marshal hussein tantawi .
his arrival was accompanied by with chants of &quot; the army and the people are one hand &quot; from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main auditorium of the university .
the university in cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s , has become a bastion of the islamic student movement .
mursí took a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , where the revolution that ended mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed that he grabs the presidential powers taken from his office , the military council that took over from the misery of the leader .
but the approval of the composition of the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament , as is customary , he acceded to the will of the army , which suggests that the power struggle will continue .
mursího speech in tahrir square was filled with dramatic populist gestures .
who really wants to get to know a city , he should go to the cemetery .
his visit will reveal more than a walk načančaným centre with monuments , churches and galleries , more than told the guidebook aside .
many people &quot; read from the graves . &quot;
slowly roam cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local realities .
find out what kind of people live here , what nationality , what are the faith in both large and coherent families belong in which age is dying , as rich as important for them , their titles and professions .
how they express their social status , which have a taste .
and from the state of the graves finds , and how to ensure their dead relatives .

i managed to find one of the ingenious tunnels for smuggling drugs between the us and mexico , accompanied by their own lighting , ventilation and electric rail .
american authorities have described the tunnel , measuring roughly one-by-one metre as one of the ingenious secret passages that ever occurred .
the tunnel , which meanders into the length of almost six football fields , combines a warehouse near the tijuana in mexico and san diego in the united states .

the european elite is ready to trade with britain ?
the campaign business for britain ( trade for britain ) was launched in april , with a promise to combine the businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the eu , they want to see british entrepreneurs and companies that create jobs .
to this end , we have entered the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we were the leading british businessmen asked about their views on britain , trade and the eu .
yougov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing the british businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will be a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing , while the eu states have stagnated .
they want to see how the government prefers the new trade ties with countries such as china , india and brazil to mired in a long and laborious process of reforming the european institutions .
when we asked for their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations after the laws on products - the majority of entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to westminster .
panovala general dissatisfaction with the single market and businessmen said that the cost of brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the european trade area - even 40 percent expressed approval of large enterprises , which is traditionally the most pro-european companies .
finally , our survey of leading companies revealed that the most impressive knowledge that a clear majority wants britain sought to change the treaty and the relationship with the eu , which should be based on trade , not politics .
the findings , which assume ownership of companies of various sizes and major business groups , shows that the business sector is pushing for &quot; meaningful change , &quot; which will take effect back to britain .
the stakes are high-achieving changes to the treaty and a better deal for britain can mean a profit of up to 16 % of the vote in a referendum to stay in the eu .
the prime minister should not hesitate : this survey shows that the british trade supports his plan for reform of the terms of britain &apos;s membership of the eu .
it also shows that the business sector expects that this reform will mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back toward britain .
a better deal for britain is possible , given the way the eurozone is on the way for closer economic and fiscal union , and increasingly necessary .
the priority has to be jobs and growth in britain and , as shown by the results of our survey , for a business that is re-focusing on trade and fundamental change in the regulatory approach of brussels .

the british government announced a study , which aims to increase the benefits of the rail project , hs2 for scotland .
the work of hs2 suggests that high-speed services for scotland and northern england will start as soon as the first stage in the year 2026 starts .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project &quot; will join the united kingdom together . &quot;
the scottish transport minister keith brown said that he was working with the british government on this plan , &quot; enthusiastic . &quot;
the first phase will consist of a new high-speed rail line between london and the west midlands .
the completion of the phase two will lead the line from manchester to leeds .
in june , the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between london and the north of england from 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the british government , which has led talks with the national transport agency transport scotland , the company has commissioned hs2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of any travel times from glasgow and edinburgh to london corresponding to three hours or less .
the baroness kramer said : &quot; our goal for hs2 is really a national network that better linking britain and its cities . &quot;
we gave sh2 green , because the benefits it will bring , is huge .
without that , we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network .
however , it is also the link - across great britain will be better connected to hs2 18 cities , including glasgow and edinburgh .
the scottish secretary alistair carmichael added : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland . &quot;
for the scottish government keith brown , mr carmichael said to &quot; strongly &quot; supported the scottish integration into the network of hs2 .
mr brown said : &quot; the high-speed line has the potential to bring scotland immense economic benefits , but also adds the economic weight of scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across britain . &quot;
with enthusiasm , we are working with the british government to explore options to bring high speed rail to scotland and to bring all the benefits and complement the glasgow-edinburgh line , which the scottish government is planning anyway .
i look forward to reviewing the report on this study , along with british ministers during the next year and a joint decision-making on the next steps .
frontier airlines is preparing to charge for carry-on luggage
frontier airlines plans to charge during his years in the amount of up to $ 100 for a carry-on baggage on board .
frontier airlines is planning to introduce a fee of up to $ 100 for a carry-on luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although in its announcement on wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all the can .
the new fee for carry-on luggage on the luggage in the upper storage space , so a small bag under the seat will remain free .
the company frontier says it will charge $ 25 if the fee has been paid in advance and $ 100 if they are paying passengers to wait until the arrival of the gate .
the spokesman of the frontier kate o &apos;malley , listen stated that stodolarový fee is to encourage passengers to take care of payment in advance .
&quot; we neradi chose this charge , &quot; she said .
the airlines have begun to charge the first and second brought luggage in 2008 .
passengers tried to avoid the charges and poured into the cabin luggage hidden in the storage space , as close as they could , so often lacking in this area .
fees are one of the ways of the passengers to learn to take fewer things on board .
o &apos;malley , listen said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money .
the point is that the most loyal customers of the frontier is clearly expressed that to find a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult .
passengers who bought tickets on the website of the company , will not pay .
this means that one passenger in line at the gate of the frontier can bring baggage , which does not pay anything , while the other passengers in the queue for the same baggage will pay $ 100 .
o &apos;malley , listen said that the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers will learn about the fee before their arrival at the gate .
the new fee of frontier for carry-on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer , but the date has not been set yet .
passengers often on the fees for baggage and other fees are complaining , but the airline is love .
he argues that the baggage handling costs money , and passengers who are demanding this service , would have to pay for it .
many on wall street see a further charge for baggage as a sign that the airline is trying to collect enough money to cover the cost of air operations after years of losses .
but most of the fees for carry-on luggage did not rise .
the company spirit airlines as the first zpoplatnila hand luggage three years ago and other low cost airline allegiant air later followed her example .
the only company that has such charges , is hungary &apos;s wizz air , says aviation consultant jay sorensen , who closely monitors the additional charges .
in its report in december 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage company spirit will bring $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , a former manager of midwest airlines , recently flew with spirit and perplexed by what he saw at the gate , when he met with an unusual charge of spirit &apos;s carry-on luggage .
&quot; nastupování into the aircraft was the smoothest i &apos;ve ever seen in my aviation career , &quot; he said .
i expected to see at the gate gnashing of teeth and quarrels .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and the onset of in an instant . &quot;
frontier also along the lines of the company spirit exercises fees for coffee , tea , soda and juice .
frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice , may retain all the cans and coffee will be free upgrades .
the water will continue to be free of charge .
us airways , the company in 2008 briefly tried to introduce fees for drinks , but after complaints from passengers about seven months later , and no other major airline nenapodobila it .
the last move of the frontier charge for carry-on luggage , if the consumer does not purchase years directly from the airline , is her last attempt to go directly to customers on its website .
the airlines are online travel sellers , such as orbitz , from 10 to 25 dollars for each ticket sold .
this gave rise to all airlines to keep passengers to buy directly from them rather than do it through online travel agencies .
the company frontier , however , went furthest in this area .

we prostudovali 11 thousand inzerátů !
we know where you want to work !
in november last year , the analysis caught over 11,000 ads offering jobs , of which 200 were published in the daily newspaper and 6800 ads ( 62 percent ) on the internet .
the internet is thus becoming the most important medium for publishing offers of employment .
even in 2005 , when the survey was carried out for the first time , his share of 26 percent .
in the last two investigations ( 2007 , 2010 ) has stabilised at around 60 percent .
advertising job opportunities , according to the analysis largely reflects the current situation on the labour market .
an example would be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and at a time of economic crisis .
for example , in 2007 , was in the same reference period published nearly 25 900 advertisements in 2012 , it was less than half .
the offer jobs on the internet is geared towards closer , especially more qualified group of professions .
by contrast , the job offers in the daily newspaper covers a wider range of professions , including those working-class , the author of the analysis , pavlína Šťastnová .
the level of representation of professional groups in both the media is different .
on the internet have taken the place of advertisements seeking managers and executives , sales representatives , programmers and financial experts .
the position of programmers or leading small businesses acted only on the internet .
in the daily newspaper &apos;s share of these skilled significantly lower , on the other hand , a large representation include , in particular , the service and blue-collar professions .

in the daily newspaper was a requirement for the knowledge of a foreign language included in three percent of advertisements on the internet at 37 percent .
only two percent of the ads employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages .
claims on the &apos; computer literacy &quot; appeared in 40 percent of the ads in the daily press at 11 percent , on the internet in 57 percent ) .
the practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads .
requirements for the practice are generally associated with qualified professionals .
in particular , the head of production and other executives .
in particular , the blue-collar mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or a repairman electrical appliances , said study author george tillner .
employers also in the middle of their ads show the requirements for the qualities and skills of potential bidders .
like most of the required skills in advertising in the first place , already have long-term communication skills .
in addition , employers are demanding flexibility , adaptability and dynamism , autonomy , accountability , organizational skills and reliability .

it is clear from the data , real estate consultancy company cushman &amp; wakefield and jones lang lasalle .
in prague &apos;s bohnice opens to the public shopping centre krakow , will be the 19th prague shopping centre .
in the czech republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers .
neuspokojivý performance concerns about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers .
the main problems are inappropriately large centre on the site , and bad layouty , too much floors or complicated and obscure arrangement passages , or dead space center , &quot; said michael sotak from the company cushman &amp; wakefield .
also , according to the head of retail real estate jones lang lasalle sylvia samadi , about one-fifth of the trade center struggling with low attendance .
among the main reasons include , among other things , bad traffic accessibility , low income categories of local residents , or an overcapacity in the market place .
some of the projects opened almost fully occupied , but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory .
nowadays , the customers are somewhat conservative and don &apos;t like to change their shopping habits .
the new business centres must try harder &apos; lure &apos; their customers to new brands on the market , entertainment , service and marketing events , &quot; samadi said .
the shopping malls , according to sotáka generally stable , even in some centres is rising , because landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of the rent and dopronajmout some units .
&quot; but it is true that recently opened some projects that are not fully occupied , and thus reduce the average occupancy rate ( for example , breda &amp; weinstein in opava Šantovka in olomouc ) , &quot; sotak said .
shopping malls open in the past two years to promote the market , according to sylvia samadi , very slowly .
place in the market for new projects , but it exists .
the number of jobs suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited .
for example , in prague , we see scope for the construction of the project , which would serve the people of prague 6 .
certainly there is room for the construction of smaller local projects , the so-called &quot; convinience centres &apos; , focusing on everyday purchases and services for people living in the immediate vicinity , &quot; samadi said .
also , according to sotáka exists in the domestic market place for other shopping centers .
and for a small &apos; service &apos; centers , as well as for large projects in prague , or medium-sized projects , or expansion in regional cities .
&quot; cities such as kladno , České budějovice , brno or plzeň have room for further growth , &quot; sotak said .
in prague , he sees room for the upcoming trade center to champion square , also have the potential to clear the street na příkopě and wenceslas square .
&quot; intenzivně develops expansion of retail parks , which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller and smaller cities for favorable rents and operating costs , the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or a neighborhood shopping centers , or their reconstruction , such as the reconstruction of commercial houses prior benefiting from good locations , &quot; said dita kubánková from the company dtz .
in the czech republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers , with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross pronajímatelných surfaces .
a quarter of all these shopping centres is located in prague .
among the 20 largest shopping centers , according to the number of tenants , nine of them are in prague , stems from the data the company incoma gfk .

report : the obama campaign considered to replace biden for hillary clinton
the closest adviser to president barack obama , according to the new york times secretly considered to replace on the ballot in 2012 , vice-president joe biden for hillary clinton .
this revelation is the most important news eagerly-awaited book on the 2012 campaign from mark halperina and john heilemanna &quot; double down : game change 2012 . &quot;
the times obtained a copy of the incoming books and announced on thursday evening that the president &apos;s top aides held at the end of 2011 , the intensive group meetings and surveys to assess whether the waiver of the biden would help revive obama &apos;s fading hopes for re-election .
according to the national political correspondent for the times magazine , jonathan martin , the book offers a thorough record of senior officials in the campaign and in the white house , namely the former white house chief of staff bill daleyho , to measure the effect on the elections should move the former secretary of state clinton to the post of vice-president .
the potential change was a closely-guarded secret in the chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the oval office .
only a few of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including daleyho , former obama campaign manager jim messina and former main advisers in the white house , david axelroda and david plouffeho - known to be considering the change .
the book &quot; double down , &quot; says daley was a leader of efforts to replace biden , despite their close personal relationship , and that until he finally decided not to implement this move , when data showed that adding clinton to the ticket , &quot; obama &apos;s chances did not increase significantly . &quot;
in an interview with martin daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing biden clinton .
&quot; i intenzivně examined a wide range of things , and this was one of them , &quot; said a letter to daley .
you must remember that at the time he was president of the grim prospects , so we thought : &apos; christ , what are we supposed to do ? &quot;
while daley described the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; martin said little cooper of cnn that the campaign for re-election has made considerable investments in order to determine whether this move in the elections .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t interpret campaigns that kind of money on elections and qualitative research , if something really serious treatment , &quot; said martin on ac360 .
however , it is not clear whether obama knew about the fact that his team is considering this exchange .
martin said on cnn that the daleyho asked whether his former boss knew about this potential shuffling cards .
while daley said he did not think the president had the potential to change &quot; was aware of , &quot; a former office manager admitted that it was &quot; possible &quot; that obama was aware of it .
martin added that the book &quot; double down &quot; definitely does not respond to the question of whether the political probe got up to obama on the table .
cooper asked martin whether he really thought that obama did not know about the research on biden &apos;s removal from the list .
&quot; maybe , &quot; said martin .
it &apos;s not , mr. hašku .
we have a unique opportunity to send a message to politicians that they not .
there is a need to develop such pressure to martin village has been stripped of all political functions and left the mandate .
any other solution to reduce the level of political culture , which is already so slim .
martin zaštíťuje village with a promise that , but everyone , and especially policies must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what we can promise .
trust is the only capital that has policies ( mr babiš has the physical , but the question is whether the policies ) .
sebelepší program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy .
in politics is not an excuse , in politics , was resigning .
mr hašku , if you &apos;re good with this country ( and your frequent statements that were fortified me , if you do not lie - you can see just how difficult it is to lie ) , leave politics alone , like a man .
then the people will accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and bears the responsibility for it .
otherwise , you will be perceived as a spineless loser , whose words or deeds cannot be trusted .
either you want to be proud , though erring man or a lifetime of chicken .
maybe you think it is unfair , if only i am addressing you , but you &apos;re the leader and they just misguided sheep .
and you have a leader and you &apos;ve always wanted to be .
i understand that they are now trying to drop his ears to regroup , vysedět shame and then attack again , but so are guerrillas or podrazáci .
you are , i repeat , in their eyes , the leader , the alpha male , so the act .
accept the responsibility and go away from politics .
the black box in your car ?
while american road planners have struggled to find the money to repair the crumbling highway network , many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into the dashboard of your car .
the device , which are watching every mile , who travelled motorist and transmit that information to the authorities , are at the heart of the controversial efforts by washington and the offices of state planning to renovate outdated system of financing of america &apos;s main roads .
usually drab design highways suddenly prompted intense debate and the emergence of various societies .
libertariáni met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the fact that the government could use these small boxes that could record the distance travelled and perhaps even where you &apos;re going - and then use that information to the tax base .
tea party is terrified .
the american civil liberties union is also deeply anxious and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy .
and while the congress cannot agree on whether to continue , some states are not waiting for anything .
they find during the next decade , they may move to a system in which a driver pays for a kilometre road that goes .
thousands of motorists have already black boxes , some of which are using gps tracking , take to the test .
this is a real necessity for our nation .
&quot; this is not a matter of when we can afford to be choosy about , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the association of state administration in southern california , which for this state is planning to launch the monitoring vehicle kilometres in each of california motorists in 2025 .
changes to the way we pay these taxes .
it serves to this technology .
podnětem is the fact that the road trust fund financed by taxes that americans pay at the gas stations , is at the bottom .
the americans don &apos;t buy as much gasoline as before .
cars travel much more miles per gallon .
the federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon , has not increased over the past 20 years .
because of the current high price of gasoline , the politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by only one cent .
&quot; the gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , &quot; said lee munnich , an expert on transport policy from the university of minnesota .
the state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test the system of paying for the kilometre travelled .
&quot; in the long term , it seems to be the most logical alternative , &quot; he said .
experts call it a user fee , according to the mileage .
it is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals , because taxes can be used to alter the pattern of behaviour of drivers , which , for example , can help reduce traffic congestion and the creation of greenhouse gases .
kalifornští designers look to this system in planning strategies to meet the targets set out in the ambitious laws on global warming .
but republican representative bill shuster ( pennsylvania ) , chairman of the committee on transport , said that it also sees as workable as possible long-term alternative .
the leaders of the free market , from the reason foundation are also keen on the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled .
&quot; it is not a tax that will disappear into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president for strategy in the organisation of reason .
people are paid directly for what they are .
the initiative also is supported by two former american transport ministers , who urged congress in 2011 , to go towards paying for half a mile .
the us senate last year approved a pilot project for $ 90 million , which should include about 10,000 cars .
the leadership of the house of representatives , however , rejected the proposal and has done so for fear of rural legislators representing the components of the population whose day-to-day life often means to offend many miles to work outside the city .
several states and cities , however , is moving forward on their own .
nejhorlivější is oregon , which included the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers .
these drivers will soon begin to the state to pay the tax for the distance travelled , instead of taxes on gasoline .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york is examining the project .
illinois is attempting to a limited extent in the trucks .
a coalition of i-95 , which includes 17 of the ministries of transport , together with the eastern coastal states , including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) is studying how they can implement this change .
this concept , however , is not only a champion .
in nevada , where the device was recently fitted with about 50 cars volunteers , drivers were concerned that the government is able to follow their every move .
&quot; concerns about the monitoring of the type of big brother and similar issues were a major problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , who leads the management strategy and operations at the ministry of transport officials .
it was not something that people wanted .
as a pilot project , he continued , the american civil liberties union in nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be very easy to turn the device into a full-fledged tracking device . &quot;
there is no need to build a huge unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably spread to the daily trips and the arrival of individuals .
nevada is among the few countries that are trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many miles of driving the car , but not exactly when and where .
if you can do it , &quot; said khan , the public will be calmer .
the hunt for that technology has brought some state agencies to small companies in california called true mileage ( the actual distance travelled ) .
the company originally into action to help the government in the taxation of drivers were not involved .
she wanted to break into the emerging market for civil liability , where drivers would be paid on the basis of how many drives .
but this device is tested , attracts the attention of the developers of the road network , because it does not use gps and adds only a limited amount of information that are regularly recorded using a modem .
&quot; people will be more willing to go , if you haven &apos;t been following their speed and their position , &quot; says ryan morrison , executive director of true mileage .
in some of these pilot programs , a series of major errors .
they are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it .
in oregon designers has experimented with the fact that they give drivers a choice .
they can choose the gps device with or without a gps .
or does not need to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee , based on the average mileage of all the people of the state .
in other places in the hope that the public continues on this concept will proceed if the device will be able to more , not less .
in the city of new york , transportation officials are trying to develop the device , which would be equipped to be able to pay extra fees for parking hours to provide insurance , according to the vehicle kilometres and gathering data on the speed of other drivers , so motorists can avoid the traffic jam .
&quot; motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them , &quot; says the design document city .
some transportation planners , however , would like to know whether any discussion about paying for a kilometre is not just a giant with the problem .
officials from the metropolitan transport committee in the san francisco bay area , say that congress might have a problem with the bankrupt silničním trust fund very easily solved by increasing the tax on gasoline .
single or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars , they do not consume a lot of fuel , so that they will have to pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no need for any radical surgery , it &apos;s enough to take aspirin , &quot; said randy rentschler , director of the committee for legislation and public affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy and a lot of other things .
with which a billionaire , you will use the phone next year ?
kellner , the owner of the ppf group , wants to buy the operator o2 .
the two companies confirmed the talks , according to various sources of agencies and from behind the scenes is said to have a hand in the sleeve .
the announcement of the transaction should come back in november , probably before the start of the auction frequencies for lte network , before 11 november .
kellnerův competitor karel komarek kkcg own group .
it is under the brand sazka telecommunications embarked on auction frequencies for lte network .
and to everyone &apos;s surprise , in the meantime , the taste of the telecommunications firms to penetrate .
but the sazka now leads a very experienced telecommunications man robert chvatal .
he started as a marketing chief of radiomobil ( now t-mobile ) , eventually becoming director of the slovak t-mobile and the last time was in charge of the austrian branch of the same operator .
sazka plays just a few cards at once .
přihlásila the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for vodafone virtuála .
and it makes sense .
if it succeeds in the auction , so he will be able to move into its network of existing customers from its virtual operator .
it would normally like vodafone , but according to the information , the newspaper that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies .
vodafone currently suffers from an agreement between the competing operators o2 and t-mobile , who will be fully share their networks .
vodafone it needs a partner .
and it may be just sazka .
if it succeeds in the tender for lte network ( as a freshman , specially designed to auction spectrum ) and vodafone , the auction may not go at all , and he won &apos;t mind auctioning only limited spectrum ( not enough frequencies for all ) .
vodafone , the sazkou can share the network .
vodafone drops sazka into its 2g / 3g network ( or newly built lte network on the frequency of 900 mhz ) , which will allow the company to kick-start the network .
sazka between starts to build costly lte network , which will be able to use and vodafone .
spokojeny may be both companies .
vodafone uspořené money would then be able to spend on a fixed internet providers or cable tv .
and kellner ?
that would buy the czech and slovak o2 ( slovakian branch is the daughter of a czech ) immediately gained a full operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services .
but on the other hand , it is a big juggernaut , which will wait for the restructuring .
in the auction would gain kellner &apos;s lte network for the o2 and very likely in conjunction with t-mobile .
the two companies already had declared that the network will be shared .
the auction could finally be a success , but probably not enough with high amounts of the national budget .
and from next year , so customers in the czech republic can choose between a call with vodafone , t-mobile , kellnerem or komárkem .
aneb two titans of the czech business against the global giants .

the officers saw sarborougha ( 32 ) , as he left the house in blackburnu právníkově in lancashire , who was having dinner with colleagues from the law society , three bags of cocaine .
on the basis of the tests in which they found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards , the investigation showed that ditta was a regular user of class a drugs .
during a period of eight months , from january to august 2011 , tout tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of scarborougha and his companion .
all four suspects were monitored at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
after police arrested during a series of hauls of heroin and cocaine worth about £ 1.5 million , along with £ 200,000 in cash , in jail , together with them over the next 32 people .
ditta ( 42 ) passing information to criminals out of fear that they will come to his addiction to cocaine .
today , ditta , who works at the law society forbes solicitors , based in blackburnu before liverpoolským crown court shameful moment when he was found guilty after a three-week trial that in two cases , defended the administration of justice .
during an earlier hearing , confessed to possession of cocaine .
právníkův downfall occurred after scarborougha for police investigations revealed that he was in february 2011 in regular telephone contact with dittou .
two detectives suspect watched dittova recorded his arrival at the house and saw him put the drugs on the purity of 60 percent below the lawyer &apos;s basket in the black golf glove .
he was subsequently scarborough with dittou , who was at the dinner at the football stadium blackburn rovers at ewood park , in a telephone conversation .
the lawyer returned home , where he found the drugs , and nine conversations took place between the two parties .
the court said it found traces of class a drugs in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards and that ditta was &quot; a regular user &quot; of cocaine .

prokurátorka anne whyte said : &quot; who else is more aware that they must not violate the right to counsel in criminal matters . &quot;
mr ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer and that he was in very close contact with a specific client .
the relationship that we &apos;re talking about here is not just about drug dealer , but drug dealer , who had his own lawyer drug supplies .

with some of their clients are too close , especially with the scarboroughem , and allowed to undermine its independence .
ditta offence refused and said : &quot; if i was a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and i wish mr scarboroughovi to hand over the information , i would expect 15 hours , but i would do it immediately . &quot;
after the hearing , however , of lancashire police inspector lee halstead said : &quot; mr ditta from a lawyer in the criminal field alone has become a criminal when he began to obtain drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leaders of the organized crime groups , which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation .
legal representatives must adhere to the highest standards of integrity and to inspire confidence in the public , and feel that they can rely on them .
mr ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of their profession .
unit for serious and organised crime in lancashire ran against mr dittovi investigations on the basis of which he was convicted in three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice , which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to all criminals , that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
we &apos;ll find you and we will build in front of our courts .
alone scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
another thirty-five people involved in the trade were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website ditta held an online interview in which he said that his dream job would be legally represent clients from the cellblock death in america , as a guest at the dinner he wished mohammed ali and as an incentive for the work of the inequality .

yesterday , obama from his original promise flinched .
&quot; the vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
with regard to what he called &quot; rumors &quot; in the media about the testimonies , obama called on americans who have received the notification , to search for new safeguards on the market .
most people will be able to have a better , more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even more cheaply than anticipated .
&quot; you &apos;ll get a better offer , &quot; he said .
his administration has argued that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population , which buy insurance for itself , it may be forced to change the program , because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the law on the affordable care .
&quot; i say that these americans on the plane : you deserve something better , &quot; sebelius said in his testimony before the committee on energy and commerce in washington .
sebelius , who oversees the implementation of the affordable care , said that the launch of the online market since october was &quot; miserable . &quot;
&quot; i am disappointed and angry as everyone else , &quot; she said .
i &apos;ll try to get back your confidence .
annoyed sebelius this sentence , which caught the mike , said yesterday in the direction of the advisors seated behind her at yesterday &apos;s meeting of the committee , which was held after a heated quarrel as taking a republican billy long , a representative from missouri , which involved whether she must also engage in obama &apos;s healthcare program .
for more than three hours during a hearing at sebeliusovou repeatedly asked the question of why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care voluntarily gave up a government-sponsored insurance , and nezakoupil a program through the healthcare.gov , which is now forcing millions of americans .

výherce receives $ 250,000 to continue its extraordinary work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle watched his father again and again lapsing into unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
jamef bwelle was in 1981 , near the capital city of yaounde cameroon injured in a car crash .
at first he was cured only with a broken arm , but then he developed an infection that has spread to the brain , and there has created a hematoma , which caused him problems all his life .
&quot; in cameroon were no neurosurgeons , &quot; says georges bwelle .
we &apos;d have to take him out of cameroon , if we had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years by his father was carrying to the crowded clinics and hospitals , where he received a treatment that was available .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; says bwelle .
you can leave the house at five in the morning , to rush to the hospital to get there first , but you are not the first .
there are a lot of patients .
some people are dying because they must wait .
since 2002 , when bwelleho father died , the situation has not changed too much .
according to the world health organization in cameroon , there is only one doctor for 5,000 inhabitants .
just for comparison , the ratio in the united states is one doctor at 413 inhabitants .
and even if the doctor could visit the cameroonians , many would couldn &apos;t afford it .
two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of the cost of health care in this country are private .
&quot; the only problem that they have is poverty , &quot; says bwelle .
with due to poverty , we cannot take his life .
bwelle when he saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer , he decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his team of volunteers had done last year , free 700 operations .
he became a doctor cardiovascular surgeon at the central hospital in yaounde .
and ascovime founded a non-profit organization whose members on the weekend visit rural areas , where they provide medical care for free .
since 2008 , his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people napěchuje to supply , attached to the roof of medical supplies and travel rough terrain to the villages that need help .
it is not always accompanied by luck .
more than once , the vehicle must push through the river and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be welcomed as the real heroes : feast , singing and dancing and the best accommodation that community can offer .
in these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willingly engaged in a local amusement .
the next day , the team starts to treat hundreds of patients .
&quot; we have 500 patients on each trip , &quot; says bwelle .
they come to the village from a range of 60 kilometers , and on foot .
during each of these weekends doctors provide different medical aid .
many are treated with malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parazitními diseases and sexually transmitted diseases .
others may get the crutches or donated glasses or birth certificate for free - a document that calls for the school , but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team is doing under the local anaesthetics simple operation .
the operation is usually do in the school at the town hall or at home ; after the operation , the patient gets up and goes to zotavovacího places to make room for the next patient .
for using the light from a generator , an operating room and sanitary equipment bwelle and his volunteers are working into the early morning hours .
it &apos;s exhausting , but the village musicians usually team will help to keep his motivation .
&quot; to stay awake and continued to work , play the drums all night , &quot; bwelle says .
on sunday , the team will head back to the city , tired but proud of his work .
this group - consisting of cameroon &apos;s foreign doctors and medical students - carried out last year , 700 free operations and is aware that their aid can mean a lot for local residents .
one man said that after a hernia operation will be able to work again .
&quot; it will change the future of our family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to organizing the following weekend clinics and work as a surgeon in the hospital at night bwelle also works for private health clinics around the city of yaounde .
he says that this second work financed by about 60 % of its non-profit activities ; the rest is covered by private contributions .
&quot; i &apos;m not sure exactly when sleeping , &quot; says katie o &apos;malley , listen to the second year studying medicine at the university of drexelově in philadelphia and worked as a volunteer for the bwelleovu group .
it is always either in the hospital or trying to get money for the organization that these campaigns could do .
for students of medicine and nursing services , such as o &apos;malley , listen , who came from the united states or europe to join bwelleovi on his mission , it &apos;s a great experience , which would gain at home .
&quot; dr. bwellemu we they washed his hands thoroughly and remove stains , or we kept his tools , &quot; says o &apos;malley , listen .
this as a medical student in the second year in america never experience .
students volunteers usually pays a trip to cameroon alone and often arrive with given medical needs .
once they arrive in yaounde , food , transport and the study gives them bwelle .
&quot; no doubt it is a hero , &quot; says o &apos;malley , listen .
this organisation gives his life and his desire to help the people of cameroon is infinite .
for bwelleho constant a drag is not a burden .
helping others to live happier , fulfilling a promise he had made to his father , is something that brings great joy .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy when i &apos;m doing this job , &quot; says bwelle .
and i think of my father .
i hope that can see what i &apos;m doing .
a smile people to alleviate their pain - that is the reason why i &apos;m doing this .

the number of people infected with the hiv virus crossed a thousand in prague
in the czech republic , the number of people infected each year .
for example , in 2002 the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people , five years later , there were 121 , and in 2010 , there were 180 .
last year , it was infected with 212 and it was a record number .
&quot; the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 , in my view , there is no doubt , &quot; said an expert on the issue of aids miroslav hlavaty , who for years led the prague house lights for patients .
according to him , has grown from january to september last year in the country of 165 patients with hiv , this year over the same period , there were 176 .
since the beginning of the follow-up to the end of september this year hiv tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women , and most of the infected was in prague .
their number in september reached 1005 .
was in the county resident 206 infected .
he also listened to a diagnosis of 156 people from south moravia , 130 of the moravian-silesian or 116 from Ústeckého .
at least infected comes from the highlands , there were 19 .
a total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex .
fourteen people were infected in the past when the blood transfusion .
such a case , but since the beginning of the testing , for more than a quarter of a century , in the czech republic .
with the hiv virus was born six children , traveled at them from the mother .
children should learn the myths and legends such as &quot; models for the way of life , &quot; says the author .
stories about thórovi may show that the &quot; brute force can match clever trickery , &quot; while the arthurian legend reveals how important it is to have a dream .
a large part of the myths , &quot; for teaching at the school was too wild , too scandalous and in some cases too obscene , &quot; said crossley-holland , who advocates the selection of works of the appropriate age .
&quot; i think it &apos;s great that the myths and folk songs are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i hájil this plan for 20 years .
he added that &quot; openly with their lessons , &quot; the authors and teachers are engaging in a story with a &quot; subliminal paid &quot; message for children as a &quot; light switch . &quot;
crossley-holland , who translated from anglosaštiny epic beowulf , who also writes the norse myths ( penguin book ) and the british national stories , he says : &quot; you can have good intentions , but you &apos;ll do better if you leave it for myself . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between the adult author píšícím for adults and adults author píšícím for children is the need for a sense of hope .
not that everything must be simplified or end up happyendem , but there must be a natural sense of right and wrong .
and he must be unconscious ; revealed through the story , not openly stated .
the old truth about the fact that it is better to show than to describe .

with the growing poverty middle class are experiencing a pawnshop in singapore to flourish
in a pawn shop in a shopping centre in singapore stops bendemeer janani amirthalingaová gold bracelet , ring and earrings to her daughter to pay tuition .
&quot; with my husband , we just bought a house , and i put all my money on it , &quot; says ms amirthalingaová .
although each month as ceo gets 2400 dollars ( 3000 sgd ) and her husband also works , the family &apos;s monthly income is insufficient , he says .
demand across the areas in southeast asia - where the increased household debt - is indeed that the company of valuemax , where a woman carries out its transaction , this week became the third pawnshop on the stock market in singapore on the ladder .
stopping jewellery is not just a quick way to borrow the cash - 1300 sgd , in the case of mrs amirthalingaové - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
zastavárny in singapore normally applied the annual percentage rate of 17 percent , just above the 15,4procentní rate offered by the bank , united overseas bank , a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center .
zastavárny , however , have the advantage that do not require verification of the person ( the history ) or proof of income , and can provide a loan faster than the banks .
and so , as families are feeling the pressure because of the increasing cost of living and rising household debt and consumer debt , millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops .
after five years of growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , supported by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies , low-and middle-income families are turning to the pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation .
this week , the rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s cited the increasing use of credit in households , mainly because of the increasing nájmům as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of the asian banks .
she said that malaysia , thailand and singapore are due to the gross domestic product , the highest household debt in asia .
malaysia is at the head of the rankings , with a ratio of 80 percent of gdp , up from 60 percent in 2008 .
economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which has just received this week from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed continuing weak exports and a decline in consumer demand .
&quot; the bottom line is that the rising cost of people from high to low-income scale &#91; &#93; will try to supplement their income , wherever they can , &quot; said song seng wun , an economist at malaysian bank cimb .
historically , the high price of gold in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people quickly stop their personal property and use the opportunity to exchange for cash their family jewels .
about 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 urban zastavárnách consists of gold .
people say : the price of gold looks good , we &apos;ll stop grandma &apos;s gold necklace and we &apos;ll get him back next month .
the largest operator of pawn shops in thailand , easymoney , noted in recent months to 20procentní an increase in the number of customers using its pawn shop .
growth in the sector zastavárenském is so large that valuemax , the operator of a branch in downtown bendemeer and 15 similar in singapore , is planning to expand , not only in neighboring malaysia , where it has four branches - but also outside asia , says executive director valuemax yeah lee ching .
the company will finance the use of 60 percent of the 66 million sgd , which gained this week on the singapore stock exchange .
while some of the discount creditors came under fire of criticism because of the high interest , mrs. yeah says that the pledge offers not only a lower rate than other creditors , but it also directly does not increase the debt .
&quot; customers stop objects , which already owns , and the realisation of personal assets does not increase the debt of households , &quot; he says .
in the company &apos;s pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure the short-term , secure financing .
among those who use the pawnshop , moreover , are not the only people in financial distress .
bohatí people from singapore also use the branch of valuemax , when calling gold bars or a rolex watch , and so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
our customers are from all sorts of circumstances .
&quot; these include wealthy individuals who are in need of a short-term loan for his courageous shops or investments , or small businesses that need help in solving the problems in their cash flow , &quot; says ms yeahová .
sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible .
in the fall of the website is accusing the nsa hackers , but &quot; internal error &quot;
the mystery of the national security agency said last friday that its website for several hours last week fell due to an internal error , not because of the attack by hackers , as some claimed on the internet .

previously , the nsa spokesman told abc news that the agency &apos;s internal sensitive networks were &quot; not at all &quot; at risk .
the spokesman said that no classified information is not compromised .
at least one group of online activists hackerských claimed that the nsa is responsible for the decommissioning of the pages through the ddos attack .
ddos attacks are designed to overwhelm the target website information until nepřetíží servers and the page falls .
this cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to get into the internal networks of the target system .
the former nsa oh-so-quiet agency , which had gained the nickname &quot; no such agency in recent months has become a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs in the public spotlight and a caustic criticism of the overall product of alienation of secret nsa files from the agency and their disclosure disenchanted former employee edward snowdenem .
the growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked earlier speculation that today &apos;s accident was the result of targeted cyber operations .

newspapers have attributed the private investigator glenn mulcairea to hacked into the voicemail pawlbyové and penetrated her privacy , but the court said that coulson called her and left her voicemail message .
&quot; the prosecutor suggests that mr coulson , who is now editor of the notw , is not a man who stands in front of the house and hopes to catch people out , but the man who likes to people the connotation of stories to see what they have to say , &quot; said mr edis .
he said that the newspaper notw used three ways of exploring stories : nabourávání into the phone , monitoring and confrontation .
editor is personally involved in the third method .
evidentně knows about the other , monitoring , must know about it .
and what about the first ?
he knows about nabourávání on the phone ?
he says no , we say : &quot; oh , he knows . &quot;
fámy of romance in which clarke is involved , were first captured the notw story in the newspaper , when the source , who was sexually interested in mrs pawlbyovou , was told : &quot; you &apos;re wasting your time , it is with charles . &quot;
the record with vocal messages that were taken from her phone on at least three occasions , was obtained in mulcairově house in august 2006 .
investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator , where mrs pawlbyová and her sister were referred to as &quot; projects . &quot;
during a time when mrs pawlbyová investigated , her grandparents received an anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about pawlbyové , said mr edis .
in the meantime , the former chief reporter neville thurlbeck and former reporter james weatherup saw to monitor the movement of mrs pawlbyové .
coulson 18 june 2005 , she left a voice message , in which he told her : &quot; i &apos;ve got a story that we are going to go tomorrow and i &apos;d like to talk with charles power . &quot;
mr edis says coulsona involvement in the story was the same model as for other important personalities , including former interior minister david blunkett .
in court on thursday , said that mr coulson confronted blunketta because of a romance with a married woman while he himself had seen the spoluobžalovanou rebecca brooks , who was married at the time .
coulson and brooks have denied conspiracy with others to hack into the phones in the period from 3 october 2000 until 9 august 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup confessed to hack into the phone .
ben greenman : the 10th anniversary of the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
it could be argued that the city of new york is the place where he was born in america solo comic performances : nearly a hundred years ago with the artist frank fray , who worked as chairman of the ceremony at the palace theatre on broadway , he began telling jokes to the congregation of the conversation .
fayova innovation has expanded over the years , most recently through the new york comedy festival .
the festival , founded and directed by caroline hirsch , on that point , the founder of the institution &apos;s solo comedy carolines , celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than 60 houses in small clubs and large theaters .
&quot; most of these titles appeared at carolines and became a successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club , &quot; hirsch said .
this festival , we have created as a way to continue to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes appearances wanda sykesové , kathy griffin and bill maher , as well as the &quot; stand up for heroes &quot; ( stand up for heroes ) , the annual musical comedy performance , in madison square garden , which among other musicians bruce springsteen , jon stewart , roger waters and bill cosby .
as well as the spread of this festival , extended the world of comedy .
several comedians participating in this year &apos;s festival came from non-traditional channels , such as the show in smaller radio or television companies , such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll climbed to his sitkomem ( lightly spicy &quot; league &quot; on fantasticko-football topic on fxx ) and now has his own comedy show on comedy central station .
jenny slateová was a member of both the &quot; saturday night live &quot; and &quot; parks and restaurant , &quot; but most known for the spreading a series of videos , &quot; marcel the shell with shoes on &quot; ( the urinal marcel in boots ) .
as kroll and slateová , as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices ( surreálně pessimistic anthony jeselnik , scathing , racially targeted w. kamau bell ) , are the product of the decentralized world of american comedy .
one of the biggest taháků festival will interview : david steinberg will speak with larry david .
steinberg started as a solo comedian , but he became a successful television and film director , as well as the unofficial historian comedy .
from 2005 to 2007 he held at the station , tv land show called &quot; sit down comedy with david steinberg . &quot;
the meeting will be held at the town hall in downtown manhattan .
&quot; this city is definitely in the comedic dna for larry &apos;s work , &quot; said steinberg .
he told me that when he was here , sometimes walking down the aisle between the two buildings and he says , &apos; man , if i lose all the money , maybe i &apos;ll live here .
many of the things moved , and it is different .
maybe commentator pečinka spoke so that they could agree with that , while the president Štěch fanning discord .
the general chovanec was suspect me as soon as he was elected to the presidency , and confirmed it .
the president of sobotka has always been , and is a symbol of the misery Čssd to continue .
other gentlemen mainly demonstrated its weaknesses .
senator dienstbier is principled and readable and useless , vice-president zaorálek blocked most of the conversation on television .
on this basis , i don &apos;t see a better option than to Čssd proposed by prime minister gajdůškovou vice-president of the senate , that one should not an initial handicap and i think he would have done the standard performance .
this is as good a solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support .
dodávám that this solution is the only way to forget what it has done , and continue without rupturing the party .
alena gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with just a blessing from the chairman of the grouping of babiše and free , but with the health minister lidoveckým hovorkou , which is actually the faithful social democrat .
the government should minimenšinová great stability , because it would promote a law on the referendum and that is committed to support and chairman of the dawn okamura .
the babiš would eventually come to terms with the progression of the taxes , because it is a shrewd and sees that it can &apos;t do without it .
lidovci would nepřinášeli problems because hovorka was awarded the best of what they have , and the government would otherwise have been .
the same is true of the yes , there would be a valuable minister , but when they do not want to enter into a reasonably risky government participation , but will provide support , as well as well .
add the courage alyona gajdůškové !

concerns about the safety of mozambique are escalating because of the conflict of strong personalities
under the statue of samory machely , mosambického president of the founder , is at the center of maputo , thousands of people gathered for a rare public demonstration chanting peace slogans .
&quot; we want to back the peace ; we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , executive director of the investment company .
out of fear for the future of their country &apos;s corporate dress in a t-shirt emblazoned with the words &quot; we want safe &quot; in portuguese and joined thursday to the crowd at independence square in the capital city .
after two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo party , one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement in front of more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once notorious rebel movements , originally supported by white rule in rhodesia and then the government of apartheid in south africa as part of efforts to destabilise the independent of the government of this country .
the peace agreement in 1992 , has become an opposition party .
analysts believe that it is unlikely to re-open conflict broke out in the country , but recent events got frightened foreign investors and local .
at stake is a rapidly growing economy , since the discovery of large offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest over the next few years may bring from companies such as rio tinto and vale of brazil , italy &apos;s eni and anadarko american , investments worth more than 50 billion dollars .
the ruling party frelimo outside the dominant political force since 1975 , and renamo accuse each other of the tension .
renamo party claims that the government has raised the last conflict by 17 september has launched an attack on their members in the province of sofala , a traditional bastion of the renamo party .
violent assaults on the former rebels subsequently peaked when government forces attacked the base of the renamo and tried to kill afonsa dhlakamu , the leader of the group , told the financial times the renamo spokesman fernando mazanga .
the government blames for the launch of the renamo conflicts , because he had attacked the soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to ease the fears of instability .
mr guebuza for the french news agency afp on wednesday said that mr dhlakama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever is left of his forces to try to prove that the government can make their own decisions . &quot;
as frelimo outside that renamo claims that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have risen when the word was quoted by mr mazangy that renamo party withdraws from the 1992 peace agreement .
listu ft said that he meant that the party frelimo outside the agreement does not respect .
&quot; our goal is to return to negotiations , but with the seriousness , &quot; said mr mazanga .
previous talks between the parties have done to alleviate the tension between the parties , fomented by a series of skirmishes in this year , few .
it is a skirmish between the two big personalities ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , said the lecturer at the open university and an expert on mozambique joseph hanlon .
not one of them is a good negotiator , and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
renamo party , which has sought to electoral changes , has already expressed that boycotted the municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators interpreted the use of force as a dying movement &apos;s efforts to obtain the benefits from the government and financial proceeds .
the election of the renamo is decreasing since 1992 , while the newer party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( dhm ) , which was founded by a former member of the renamo , expected to improve its position in the elections .
mr mazanga says that mr guebuza - whose second term ends next year - he wants to destroy democracy in this country .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t want multi-party democratic system , does not want a transparent elections , does not want peace , because he doesn &apos;t want to let go of the presidency , &quot; mazanga said .
it is unclear what renamo party has options , but carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and the south .
most of the clashes took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred miles away from the capital city of maputo , but where is the city of beira , a port , which rely on mining companies , including companies , rio tinto and vale , with its exports of coal .
in june , the company rio has suspended the use of the railways for about a week , when party renamo threatened to attack on this line .
mr mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether renamo repeated his threat .
renamo wanted &quot; to warn the international community that the situation in mozambique is not good , &quot; mazanga said .
instability has increased the frustration of the government , says fernando lima , head of the independent media company mediacoop , and many people are also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings .
&quot; people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is borne entirely by the government and the president and that he should be the one who will find solutions to the problems , &quot; he says .
demonstrant omar sultuane says that people just want stability .
&quot; nobody cares neither renamo , frelimo outside again , people just want peace , they want to have free access to the road , &quot; he says .

aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of seats at stake are large contracts
among the leading aircraft manufacturers has emerged in the width of seats in the second grade in the long-distance flights , which this month the bitter exchange of views on the air show in dubai .
the issue is the width of seats on long-haul flights for economy class - not just the one that usually preceded the airlines , but whose allotted space is the key to the demands of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by airbus sas and boeing .
the company airbus this week called for industry standards , which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class , but the main american rival boeing says airlines are to decide on it .
the dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of its two long-range aircraft , with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 november .
that &apos;s how it is the rear part of the plane disintegrated - especially if it is around 9 or 10 seats - is the basis of economic performance of the proposals for new aircraft &quot; mini-jumbo . &quot;
the company boeing says that the improved model of &quot; 777x &quot; delivers 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread across 10 in each row .
the company , airbus says the a350 will carry a competing version of its model of 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out at 9 .
the giant aircraft are often attack each other in the technical issues through advertisements in the professional media .
airbus now before the air show in dubai , where it is expected that the 777x will gain the upper hand , with more than 100 orders , calls directly to the public .
recently , provisionally showed what could be the start of a new advertising war , when financiers showed a picture depicting three people crowded together in a restaurant with the headline &quot; leave you like it ? &quot;
&quot; boeing is promoting long-haul flights in the seats closer than they are in the regional turbo-prop aircraft , &quot; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
what is changing eating návky , people are bigger , but the seats on planes are radically changed .
since the early 1970s , when boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-distance air transport to the turn of the century , according to data from the us department of health , the weight of the average american aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent .
according to the american health statistics , the average american in the 21st century over 100 cm .
airbus says that his rival is the concept of seats from the 1950s , when the average width of the seats newly pokřtěného aircraft were lower .
the company , airbus says it has carried out research that suggests that the extension of the seat of 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent .
boeing airbus rejects the dimensions of the seats and says that it is not within the competence of the aircraft manufacturers to decide on how airlines compensate for fees and equipment .
the company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat .
&quot; i really want to give the airlines flexibility and enable them to do things that are convinced that they must do to be successful , &quot; said an expert in the area of kent craver .
they don &apos;t want to dictate to them what brings them a profit .
they know their business better than anyone else .
it is vital for passengers more room for his elbows , but for the supplier is a growing problem that can affect yields .
to this dispute is a race in aircraft orders , with an estimated trade in the next few decades , with a value of at least 700 billion dollars at catalogue prices , enough to tip the balance of american and european exports .
as stated in july , the agency reuters , the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft .
both airbus and boeing claims that are in its recent proposals of the twin-engine long-haul aircraft efficiency by 20 percent better than the market leader in this segment , a model of the boeing 777-300er with 365 seats .
the performance claims boeing depends partly on the design of the 777x model , compared with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row .
profit in the unit cost is compared to 10sedadlovému concept weakened .
&quot; the reason that boeing does is home to more seats , and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , head for the convenience of passengers on the airbus for europe .
on the other hand , analysts say that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many of the passengers is for denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees .
&quot; forty-five inches wide-seat passenger would be great , but the reality is that from a business point of view , airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 model , &quot; said an expert on the interior of the cabin , mary kirby , founder and editor of the portal runway girl network .
airbus and boeing are not supplying seats , but the airlines offer a catalogue of suppliers to choose .
scestovalí sellers of aircraft even carries measuring the zone to check the competitive arrangement .
while the comfort , all manufacturers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travelers .
airbus is offering the a350 model , with 10 seats in a row , but says it still hasn &apos;t sold .
donedávna airbus stressed the need for greater regulation of the cabin that offered for some of its aircraft wider seats in the aisles .
experts say that without the support of the manufacturer &apos;s only other major modern aircraft call for new industry standards they will remain , but may deter them from the waves of the sale of the 777x .

therefore , it is quite likely that significantly reduces the cost of producing its own shows , film and production activities .
companies , google , samsung and huawei sued for nortel patents
the group , which owns thousands of defunct nortel patents , on thursday filed a patent infringement action against manufacturers of mobile phones , including google , a company that přelicitovala at auction in the bankruptcy of the company nortel .
konzorcium rockstar , which has purchased nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , zažalovalo at the us district court in texas , samsung electronics , htc , huawei and four other companies for patent infringement .
the company rockstar is in the common ownership of companies apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is accused of breach of the seven patents .
patents include technology that helps to join a popular expression on the internet with the relevant advertising , says the action , which is the core of google &apos;s search business .
representatives of the samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar were not immediately available .
samsung , htc and huawei produce phones that run on google &apos;s android operating system , which competes with mobile products , apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google has made the firm nortel patents for a starting bid of $ 900 million .
google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $ 4.4 billion .
after he was defeated in the battle for the nortel patents by rockstar , google earned $ 12.5 billion for motorola mobility , which was motivated in part by a group of motorola &apos;s patents .
&quot; despite the failure in an effort to obtain patents in the auction , which are the subject of the dispute , google infringed on patents and continues to violate , &quot; he says in the lawsuit .
the company rockstar seeks increased compensation from google , because it is a violation of a patent from the google deliberately , as claimed by the action .
george kerevan : divided europe gives the scots choice
another day , another ghost story of independence .
this time , warning that a condition for an independent scotland &apos;s membership in the eu would be its entry into the schengen area .
it gave the cause for stories of passport checks in berwick and a barbed wire fence along hadrian &apos;s wall .
the truth is that the newspaper strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of europe , but - as expected - that did not translate into the headlines of newspapers .
no one mentioned that the eu member states spends a lot of time to adapt their official laws when it suits them .
given that scotland is now in the schengen , offer continued non-compliance would be for brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the scots really want .
so it is quite weak story .
and it was so old that it has become a relic . the canard that &quot; independence means passport control , &quot; i heard from at least 40 years ago .
however , in this bearded story is an interesting idea .
why would he ever have expected that an independent scotland will listen to europe ?
why replace london &apos;s yoke for the brussels , especially now ?
this is a real european story : a post-war plan to unite europe finally failed .
as a result of the euro crisis is the so-called project europe officially dead .
across europe , the influence of the party dedicated to opposition to the eu or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency .
even in germany , eurosceptic party , alternative for germany-based this year - came out of nowhere and in september &apos;s federal elections had taken nearly five million votes , making the bundestag essentially &quot; wipe out &quot; the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) .
at home has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , has become a decisive moment .
Úspornost dictated by germany and the european central bank , together with the straitjackets navléknutou on the national economy through adherence to the common currency have led many to believe that the project has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of greece .
rather , it is a system of the euro , which is blocking its members to exchange rates favorable for german exporters - and that german politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency , the southern europe in the area of domestic production , compared to germany disadvantage .
the only help is to cut revenues and public spending - which encourages germany .
under the current problems with the budget and currency is the deeper cause of europe &apos;s languid performance .
as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy policy supported by brussels - code for the support of the french and german companies at the expense of consumers - the european industry twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than it is in the united states .
this is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost , as we have already seen in the case of grangemouth .
not all the freezing salaries in the world would not reverse zadupání european petrochemical industry a slate of cheap oil from the us .
the result is a simmering rebellion , particularly in france , once the enthusiastic supporters of the eu .
after the war , the political elite in france saw the eu as a tool that will rein in germany and will allow paris to stand in the world at the level of washington .
berlin and paris have as a badge of political legitimacy does not need to enforce its own economic policy in europe and the battered french economy to fend for itself .
the result : the right-wing marine le pen , an anti-european national front , just won a major additional options and will postpone the ruling socialists in third place .
the queue is now the most popular party , with 24 % of the votes in france - an early warning for the uk labour that they cannot conclude that splitting the right is automatically a positive effect on the left .
as le pen disposes of their newfound popularity among the white working class ?
the european elections next year would like to use to across the european parliament has created anti-european bloc acting against the common currency .
if the anti-europe party will lead in these elections , which is likely , can a block for the first time in the history of the european parliament to dominate .
in doing so , i think in the foreseeable future , the growing anti-european feeling and attitude against the common currency together and will destroy the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but rather , transformed into something freer within the meaning of &quot; europe ( sovereign ) nations &quot; already favored general de gaulle .
germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro , but france and southern europe will resume its own currency .
i expect that the united kingdom will distance themselves from this project and come back to the united states .
however , the increased interest in washington on the pacific suggests that britain will be left atlantickému cold .
and where will be scotland ?
we can choose to be areas ( in principle ) little england .
or we can defend its own economic interests - it is also an opportunity to berlin and brussels , where they have to let us go .
i suppose that scotland would have done well in the loose arrangement of europe , provided that it has retained its own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in the non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should take a cue from norway and to maintain their economic independence .
the government of the snp in scotland is - surprisingly - the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in europe , which won a large majority in 2011 , thanks to the opposition &apos;s stance against the cuts , which had planned ( and ) implement labour chancellor alistair darling and the coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats .
it would be ridiculous if scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures imposed by berlin and brussels .
parents intersex children can choose &quot; vague sex . &quot;
germany became the first european nation , which recognises the third sex in children born with ambiguous sexual organs .
novorozené children will no longer be ranked only the male or female sex .
the new law from parents does not require for such children have any sex , and allows them to their native sheets to sex as &quot; vague &quot; or &quot; unspecified . &quot;
the aim of the law is to stop pressure on parents to look at their child hastily opted for surgery in order to determine the sex , and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexuální .
one intersexuální person , according to the bbc , after many years , she said : &quot; i am not a man or a woman . &quot;
i &apos;ll stay slátaninou created by doctors , bruised and scarred .
it is estimated that each year from 2000 babies are born , one that is neither a boy or a girl .
they are intersexuální , part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testes ) or unusually developed genitalia .
could be intersexuální wallis simpson .
determining the sex is not yet fully understood , but most experts in the united states , says that if he could not determine the sex , it is better to use the best available information and to identify them , instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed , if at all .
new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the problems with the identification of sex , said that the new german law &quot; looks like a good thing . &quot;
intersexuální children are the ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery , but for most children , it is not so , &quot; he said .
identifying the gender can be carried out without the operation and then we can wait as the identity of evolving .
the knowledge of how to develop the child &apos;s gender , is not very accurate .
no one can answer the question of why this is happening .
it is like a mystery why some people are homosexuals .
the report sent by the european committee in 2011 intersexuální described the person as different from transgenderových or transgender people , because their status is not linked to sex , but in their biological structure that is not exclusively neither male nor female , but typically consists of two and it cannot be clearly defined as either one of them .
these features may occur in the secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle volume , hairline , breasts and a figure in the primary sexual characteristics , such as reproductive organs and sexual organs , or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones .
the report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexuální and transgender people in the area , and also the level of harassment , violence and prejudice .
the boys inadequate any sex now have a special camp .
australia and nepal have already allow adults described in official documents , male , female , or &quot; third sex . &quot;
norrie may-welby , 52letá australian , in june became the first globally recognised &quot; sexless &quot; person , when she won a court appeal to the rest of his life to retain the status of a &quot; vague &quot; sex .
according to the ministry of the interior will have german passports , in addition to the m ( male ) , f ( female ) as well as a third marking x for intersexuální person .
in neighboring france , according to news reports on the france 24 issue of sex is still controversial .
in 2011 , dozens of french lawmakers in this heavily catholic countries signed a petition calling for it to be removed from school textbooks &quot; theories about sex . &quot;
the american invasion and online , the web site of the german law as well as define and wrote : &quot; with the way the world is being dragged to a new situation where sex is a matter of choice , but not sexual activity , převracíme inside out two other pillars of civilization . &quot;
one mother of an infant from maryland also said for the baby zone that he would prefer to see that children have allocated sex at birth .
&quot; parenting itself is stressful , even without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , &quot; she said on the website on parental care .
the children need stability and security .
historically , the children with both male and female sex called hermafrodité , according to the handsome river , which had a double gender .
and about ten years ago , the medical community believed that sex is something like a table that can delete and redrawing again .
but now many are questioning the ethical basis of operations with the fact that gender is a complex issue and doctors sometimes may decide incorrectly , because they don &apos;t know how , because of their gender , children will feel when they grow up .
&quot; in the mid-20th century , it was called psychiatric emergency room , &quot; drescher said .
when these children born , you call a psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the persistent theories about how to deal with children with ambiguous gender , was presented to dr. john moneyem at johns hopkins , who took the view that sex is pliable .
he created a new concept of &quot; sex &quot; and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment - as the parents of their children - were raised on children &apos;s genes and hormones , and formed a child , regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman .
but in one case of 1966 , known as the &quot; john / joan &quot; his theory has become a contentious .
the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly made , recommended that their child had been left completely fixed , removing his testicles and raised him as a girl .
&quot; the media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion , but the reality was different , &quot; drescher said .
when the boy was 15 years old , leaving the přeoperovat back to the boy and married to a woman .
in 38 years , however , committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors &quot; are using this model &quot; today .
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the internet , the survivors of these operations were &quot; dissatisfied with the result . &quot;
this was the case and jim bruce , on the writer from montana , who was born with male chromosomes , but the ambiguous sexual organs .
doctors weren &apos;t certain whether it has a large clitoris , or a small penis , and they were convinced that a man could never live &quot; satisfactory life . &quot;
and so shortly after his birth in 1976 , bruce surgically removed the bodies and testicles , and was raised as a girl .
in the 12 years the female hormones .
&quot; i knew that i am not a girl , &quot; he said to abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was very difficult to ask for it .
at 18 , he was sent to the plastic sheath .
but because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , asked for medical records .
what he found was frightening .
after birth , i was sterilised and no one ever said anything to me .
bruce was born with impaired gender development ( dsd ) , which prevents the body to produce sufficient amounts of testosterone to properly develop his genitals .
after he learned the truth , turned back to the man , taking the dose of testosterone and had to remove the breasts ,
the operation caused his infertility .
today , the others in the organization called interface project and are trying to normalise the perception of those who are intersexuální .
however , anne tamar-mattisová , director of the legal group advocates for informed choice ( supporters of an informed choice ) , based in california , is concerned that the german law &quot; calls for branding and stigmas . &quot;
&quot; many activists are concerned that a german law that will encourage parents to make quick decisions and select the &quot; vague &quot; for a child , &quot; she said .
bojíme that encourage for intervention .
we believe that it is better to allocate the male or female gender and then wait .
but we don &apos;t know how the law will eventually lead , so all we can do is speculate .
tamar-mattisová said that her organization supports the australian law , because it &quot; allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex . &quot;
&quot; an adult should be able to make their own decisions about a legally valid sex , &quot; she said .
the german law is going to assign him at birth .
this is a battle that at this moment of small child should not blame .
when they grow up , they can on their own body to make their own decisions .
but dr. arlene baratzová , radioložka chest from pittsburgh , who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group , said that the german law &quot; gives the powers &quot; of both parents and children .
baratzové &apos;s daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but the dsd called androgen numbness on the syndrome .
since her androgen receptors are defective , developed by katie feminine features .
he has a vagina , but does not have a uterus and ovaries .
katie 29letá is now married and in the studies at the university of pennsylvania , working as an intern at the child psychiatry .
although it is fruitless , hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement of motherhood .
&quot; the law gives parents some room to take their time with his decision , &quot; said baratzová .
it gives them time to perform certain tests and change his mind and gives them time to write &quot; man &quot; and &quot; woman . &quot;
in this regard , it is all right - his child educate and love it .
you have wonderful child and glad of it .
you don &apos;t have to hurry with the operation , which is irreversible .
&quot; it &apos;s an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process , as well as a child and withdrawing the anxiety that parents are constrained , because they do not have the assurance that they were doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
finally , the child will decide with which gender is more shares - and this is a great thing .
it makes children the power to make their own decisions .
the bird was flown from the oil rigs in the north sea and released back into the wild
the bird was brought to shore after he was found exhausted on the oil rig in the black sea , and released back into the wild .
one chřástal was taken by helicopter to aberdeen last month after it had tended the scottish spca company in the rescue centre until he recovers .
operating center colin seddon said : &quot; this is surely chřástal from northern europe , when it caught the wind over the north sea . &quot;
he seems to have run out of power and found refuge on the oil rig .
mr seddon added : &quot; he was not able to take off again , so we contacted us for help . &quot;

karel drabek : uhlířský hill - one of our youngest volcanoes .
uhlířský hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of waterfalls .
along with several other shows the volcanic activity in nízkém jeseník at the time ( geologically recent ) .
the last eruption , there were still at the beginning of the quaternary period .
when viewed from a distance , it is at the top of the hill uhlířského striking a white stucco baroque pilgrimage church of our lady of mercy , built between 1755-1765 .
nahradil the original wooden pilgrimage chapel .
the inn , who was standing next to the church , had survived .
shortly after the completion of the church were introduced on a row of four ranks better , about 1 km long .
cross the road to uhlířském hill is already the third version of the original stood here in 1916 , the second , lasted only from 2001 to 2004 .
at fifteen zastaveních are wooden sculptures , which had made the local artistic carver , františek nedomlel .
he used the different species from the nízký jeseník .
similarly , the base of the rocks from the area is an interesting geological exposici .
at each stop is mentioned the name of the sponsor .
uhlířský hill is the rest of the young volcano .
even if the data from a slightly different radiometric measurements of old age , the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago .
it is therefore younger than velký roudný ( 3.3 million years of age and older than venušina volcano ( 0.8 million years of age ) .
the volcano was born the explosion .
when it ejected a large quantity of volcanic ash and rock fragments from the bedrock , which acquired by firing a reddish-brown colour .
at the end of this phase of lava flowed on the surface - today , it is the porous basalt layer to 13 meters powerful .
the second eruption disgorged red , russet and points to black leucitic lava .
their layer is powerful to 50 meters , and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry .
in large tufech are conspicuous volcanic bombs of up to 1 meter , and the second eruption was completed by the outburst of lava .
at the conclusion of the activity of the volcano lava flows , which now account for up to 50 m powerful layer struskovitého basalt .
sopky , which alternates gutting volcanic ash and lava outlets are the most common type of volcanoes .
because they are actually composed of layers , were given the name stratovulkány .
the original volcanic cone was subject to a gradual erosion .
ohrožen was , however , when the mining rocks in the quarry on the southern side .
nejintenzivnější mining here ran from 1953 to 1962 .
tufy ploughed into the concrete , which was then lighter and had better heat-insulating properties .
mining has been under pressure from experts and the public to stop and thereby preserve this unique place .
the problem is , however , the cohesion in the porosity and small rocks , which quickly zvětrávají , crumbling and shedding downslope .
lom so relatively quickly disappear .
to make matters more complicated , it &apos;s warm , south-facing slope of the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals .
redress is problematic , but eventually it will be necessary to select and maintain a geological profile .
it is nothing new , similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites .
uhlířský on top of you get the green tourist sign from the waterfalls , possibly from the silesian kočova .
automobilisté may use the unpaid parking at the beginning of the linden , where even a short educational trail .
the wino doused the house with gasoline : hrozil to fire him , with his own family .
the tension increased , the fear mounted .
the man began to threaten that the whole house on fire .
on the place because they all available police patrols in the area , as well as a unit of firefighters from mlada boleslav and volunteer fire brigade unit .
he arrived on the scene and police negotiator who the men tried to talk his irrational behavior .
the man still threatened to the house on fire .
the house had to enter a unit that men disarmed and binding .
the aggressor then ended up on the examination in mladoboleslavské hospital , where he was taken to spend interception station .
firefighters eventually house with gasoline with absorbent canister , which later cleared .
the house was among those saved , as well as all domestic animals .

anger over the verdict delivered the crafter of the bomb attack in bali
přeživší and relatives of the 202 people killed in a bomb attack in bali in 2002 , reacted angrily to the judgment given over the last plotter in who were brought to justice , and said that umar patek had been executed .
patek , who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in southeast asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for having set up an explosive device that was used in the bombing .
for 15 years , he could be paroled .
the 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of kuta , which left 202 people dead , including 88 australians , and many of the wounded .
he was also found guilty on several counts of related to terrorism , including a series of bombings of churches in indonesia on christmas eve 2000 .
the prosecution demanded a life sentence , although it could insist that the man with the nickname &quot; demolition man &quot; ( bourač ) because of its reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives was given the death penalty .
this decision have revived painful memories of june corteenové , the mother of perth , which , when a devastating attack run patekem and other osnovateli nearly ten years ago lost their twins 39letá jane and jenny .
with tears in her eyes , she said that patek should be sentenced to death .
i really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others .
for the agency aap ms corteenová said : &quot; it should be built in front of a firing squad . &quot;
every day i have to live with the fact that i don &apos;t see other grandchildren and their daughters .
sari club was razed to the ground when she was 12 october 2002 , shortly after the 23rd hour fired a powerful bomb placed in a van parked outside .
paddy peter hughes was in the bar , where only about 20 seconds before a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives .
as a result of the explosion , he fell into a coma for a month , and while he was being kept alive , three doctors &quot; died . &quot;
mr hughes said that patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the jemaah islamiyah terrorist cells responsible for the massacre - amroziho , muchlase and imáma samudru - who were executed four years ago .
this guy should get the death penalty as a nobody .
keeping him alive ... no reason to keep him alive , just isn &apos;t .
getting 20 years for 202 people killed and hundreds of others injured , it is not all that much .
patek stood before the court as the last of the bali bombers .
he avoided arrest for nearly ten years , but in the end , he was captured in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where less than four months later , american forces killed former al-qaeda leader osama bin laden .
during the trial , an fbi agent had testified that the intelligence reports revealed that patek was in pakistan to meet with bin laden in an effort to re-establish a link between terrorist groups from southeast asia and al-qaeda .
&quot; nevzdal voluntarily , &quot; said mrs corteenová .
up to now , he felt sorry for the grief caused the other .
verdikt comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack , which will be later this year and to which will include the ceremony in bali and in australia .
&quot; this year , we will see a lot of tears , &quot; said mrs. corteenová .
patek is still can appeal against the judgment .
pope francis called in february , the first cardinals
on thursday , the vatican announced that pope francis on february 22 , for the first time , called the new cardinals of the catholic church .
the cardinals have the highest position in the catholic church clergy immediately after the pope , and there are those who elect the pope , francis will appoint its first group of men who will help choose his successor .
now it is 201 cardinals .
but when cardinal reaches the age of 80 years , who is unable to participate in the election of the pope - a group that is shrinking at 120 voting cardinals .
in a statement notifying this report , father federico lombardi , the vatican spokesman , said that before the promotion of the new cardinals will be held on the current cardinals known as konzistorium .
&quot; pope francis decided to communicate its decision to convene the february konzistorium beforehand to facilitate the planning of other assembly , which requires the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world , &quot; said lombardi .
jack valero from the sheet of voices said that the number of voting cardinals in february , is likely to fall .
he said that the pope usually called so many cardinals , how much they need to increase the number of electoral votes again to 120 , and many cardinals above the age of 80 years .
konzistorium next year will be significant , because it will be the first after francis was elected in march of this year , said valero .
at the moment , there is a focus on europe , europe and above all italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of roman catholics in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
it will also be the first choice of cardinals since francis has been established by the council of cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world , which was given the task of finding ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope ruled it for myself .
&quot; now , francis chose the eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said that it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that the cardinals pope asks for advice .
in this situation , but we weren &apos;t before - it is a novelty .
valero said that popes traditionally have ennobled the position of the bishops and cardinals from large places , but francis is &quot; full of surprises - so we don &apos;t know who &apos;s name . &quot;

secret war : syria , libya and iran .
training for obama , as has to bomb syria .
the american commandos in libya .
top gun in the persian gulf .
the israelis clearly demonstrate how to look the bombing of syria .
without undue hype , threats and millions of the statement sent aircraft , you hit the target and returned .
without they had become lulled by the official elimination of chemical weapons in syria .
they refuse to confirm the action and to ensure they do not represent .
the exact opposite confused and grandiose , the actions of unsupported obama &apos;s syrian policy .
and the most satisfying throughout the attack was what the israelis bombed .
don &apos;t be fooled by the media of their assertions that was bombed , &quot; syrian base &quot; or &quot; supplies for hizbaláh . &quot;
recently i wrote here about the fact that while the us aid secular rebels in the country remains on a rhetorical level , so russia happily continue supplying weapons to syria .
it is a fresh shipment of russian missiles landed in the port of latákija became the target of the israeli raid .
a clear message .
and note , israel again bombed assad &apos;s regime , not the rebels , although it according to the popular internet theory should be the other way around .
the american government , two members of the spaciálních units , probably the delta force .
netušilo so far that distinguish themselves during the attack on the american consulate in benghazi .
it is known a heroic death of two former the seals , who defended the cia in the city , i think they were members of a secret cia commandos , which is made up of former soldiers .
for a long time , there was speculation that the seals were working at the consulate or even in the cia &apos;s mansion located elsewhere .
now , it is clearer .
in any case , the information that the cia has its offices in libya protected by machine gun nests ( just over one of the two members of the seals were killed by a mortar ) , is quite surprising .
but even more surprising is the information on the two previously unknown heroes .
they were part of the american commandos in tripoli , and as soon as they received the report on the attack in benghazi voluntarily came forward to intervene and , together with five private kontraktory shot their way into the compound of the cia in benghazi .
obama administration itself the fact that during the attack wasn &apos;t the same squad deployed officially and the whole and that simply hesitant about what to do .
the leader of the squad , so without orders to release these volunteers .
in any case , the fact that the country is not a one-off , but permanent american commandos , cia agents and privacy kontraktoři is quite an interesting information .
and given that until recently was officially admitted anything like it , and even now , the only talks about a consultancy nato &apos;s mission in libya .
but it is good that the us even though half-heartedly tries to combat terrorism in libya .
although the resolution of the national situation if it wanted to help a lot bigger .
the last part of the secret and enduring conflict , i want to write about today is the coast of iran .
not so long ago , the media dress near the iranian air force for the prosecution of american drones .
few , however , it is unknown how americans their drones effectively protects .
of course , if he can find a drone in the airspace , you can &apos;t do anything about it .
however , if it is discovered the iranians drone in the area of the world , the situation is completely different .
and so it was that the iranian f-4 phantom was haunted by an american drone in international airspace over the sea , which was perhaps the first american super-sharp deployment of the f-22 raptor in history .
the pulling phantoma to visually verify its weapons without phantom registered on the radar , or simply saw it and then when he suddenly appeared at him and called on the iranian pilot to return home , he did so without complaint .
no wonder when the phantom is an american production , which , however , remembers the war in vietnam .
with raptorem cannot compare .
the court blocked the regulations concerning the stopping and searching of the police department in new york
the federal court of appeal on thursday blocked a court order requiring changes in the program to stop and search people on the police department in new york and the judge from the case .
the second us federal court of appeal said that the decision of judge shiry scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on the appeal , which was lodged by the city .
judge decided in august that the city violated the constitution so that has implemented its programme of stopping and questioning people .
the city of its conclusions and its corrective regulation , including the decision to allocate supervision , which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training program associated with them .
the court of appeal heard arguments on tuesday for the postponement .
the court of appeal said that a judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges , and the fact that the judge had not acted in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias , partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements , which openly responded to criticism of the court .
judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , when they wrongly focused on blacks and hispanics as part of its programme , stopping and frisking people .
ustanovila independent supervision to oversee major changes , including reforms in the procedures , training and supervision , and ordered the launch of a pilot programme in order to test their cameras on the body in some areas where there are the most common stopping people .
in august , the city of new york agreed the methods of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search .
oral arguments , the appeal of the city is scheduled sometime after march 14 , 2014 .
the tactic of stopping and frisking people have criticised the ranks of the defenders of civil rights .
in some form , there is a stopping and frisking people for about a decade , but recorded an independent inspection under the administration of mayor michael bloomberg &apos;s dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011 , in most cases for blacks and hispanics .
in 2004 , the framers of the four men , who all belong among minorities , an action that has become a case of collective action .
supporters of the changes of stopping and frisking people conducted by the police department in new york says that the changes will put an end to unfair practices , increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures used by other police departments .
oponenti argues that the changes will reduce police morale , but not a crime , and that the money will be wasted , but will not solve the larger problem , which is under pressure from the police force after his numbers have declined over the last decade by several thousand people .
the judge noted that the practice of not stopping and searching people , which is constitutional , but it has reformed the way searches in the new york police department has introduced .
the cdc issued a directive for schools on the allergies in children
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) released a set of guidelines to help in the case of children &apos;s allergies to food in school .
this is the first set of such directives issued by the us government , due to the fact that the number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies , rising .
one of the 20 children in the united states has allergic to food .
the cdc found that the incidence of food allergies in children has risen between 1997 and 2007 by 18 percent .
the directive for schools to include information on how to recognize the faculty and staff on children &apos;s allergies to food and how to an allergic reaction , if it occurs , to respond .
it also recommends that schools have the adrenaline - most commonly used automatic injector epipen brand - to be able to respond to the potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity .
the state legislators recently updated rules that allow schools to stock epinephrine easier .
the report also contains a list of the typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction .
the child can say : &quot; it &apos;s like somebody stabbed the language , &quot; &quot; i feel that i have to say the hair , &quot; or &quot; svědí my tongue . &quot;
as the tipsport ( not ) lubricates the personal data .
more than a year ago , i was on the tipsport.cz registration .
but then i didn &apos;t finish here , because he was sitting on a branch of someone who couldn &apos;t complete the registration of the internet .
and because i didn &apos;t want to go to another branch , registrations fell , then i moved and i changed the address and identity card .
when i wanted to complete the registration later , i was told that i couldn &apos;t do that , because i have a different number , address and that it simply is not complete and that i have to ask about the deletion of data and implement a new registration .
that &apos;s what i did , and i wrote 24.10.2013 for technical support that i am asking for the removal of all their personal data from the database under existing law on the protection of personal data .
to this day , i wrote duhý technical support that i have to complete the registration at the branch .
the marathon began e-mails on technical support , where , in the end , after 4 urganci 25.10. wrote that personal data erased at my request .
one might therefore said that could make the new registration and there were problems again as soon as possible , i wrote that my user name is already busy ( i understand it was deleted - it is not a personal data , but in the end they took out this ) .
i used a different user name and jumped to me that my personal data are already stored to finish the registration at the branch ( both may have saved something that says that erased ? ) , so i contacted again technical support .
on my question how is it possible to write off me , that personal data actually erased 25.10. and to send e-mail with the error .
that &apos;s what i did ( yesterday around 15 hours ) and to write off me today that i was registered on the same day ( 31.10.2013 ) in 13.22 and that is why it is impossible because i used the same name and date of birth .
what does it matter that the technical support for a week and i &apos;ll contact with them that it still isn &apos;t .
and what about that if it was true what they say ( he is ) no one could have to register with the same name , or the same date of birth , if this is already registered .
just by the way i did in those 13.22 registered on the same name and date of birth , but i used fictitious e-mail and phone number and the wonder of wonders , i discovered that my page on the e-mail was sent a link to complete the registration .
but how can this be possible when they cannot be registered on the same name and date of birth ?
probably because the tipsport binds registration on e-mail and phone number , and the date has not surrendered just as tough .
so i told this technical support once again that simply lie ( either intentionally or they don &apos;t know what they write ) , because what they write is not true .
i doložil several screens that the problem with the registration was 31 before making &quot; false &quot; registration on this simply does not influence .
the tipsport wrote me the stark sentence - i &apos;m sorry , but the fact that you have already registered again , we cannot verify your claim .
and the communication .
respektive repeats the same phrase over and over again that the registration binds to the name and date of birth .
nedokážou nor accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail , and there was no one , either .
if that is the bottom line , not only the tipsport that does not dispel the data as claimed , but he is lying when he says the opposite .
what &apos;s worse is that it can be easy to prove how they lie and trying to make it appear that the fault is on the side of the customer .
by the way , after putting this issue on my personal blog things to move a little bit and came from the technical support e-mail that the matter be transmitted to review and i will be informed ( after a week of urgencí and argument and warnings on the same mistake ) .
we regret the killing , but we are innocent , defends the leaders of the khmer rouge
nuon chea was the number two in the hierarchy of the khmer rouge , khieu samphan , the former head of state .
under the reign of the khmer rouge , from 1975 to 1979 was based on a mixture of maoism and nationalism , lost their lives as a result of exhaustion , hunger , disease , torture and execution of more than three million cambodians , or at least a quarter of the population .

nuon chea and khieu samphan was defended by believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and they didn &apos;t know what is the true extent of the killings .
&quot; it is easy to say that i had to know everything , everything to understand and , therefore , to intervene and to remedy the situation , &quot; he said on thursday , khieu samphan in court .
do you really think i wanted to make this happened to my people ?
the fact is that i didn &apos;t have any power , &quot; he added .
nuon chea said that he never ordered the khmer rouge cadres , &quot; with people mistreated or killed them , that they had been denied food or commit genocide . &quot;
přiznal but a &quot; moral responsibility &quot; for the dead .
&quot; i would like to sincerely apologise to the public , the victims , their families , all the cambodian people , &quot; he said .
pětapadesátiletá bin sivla , which under the regime of the khmer rouge has lost 11 relatives , the agency told afp that it cannot accept the apology , nuon chea . &quot;
&quot; he lied to us . &quot;
&quot; just wants to be acquitted . &quot;

fantastic ice cream , which glows in the dark ?
the british entrepreneur made the first ice cream , which glows in the dark - using the jellyfish .
charlie francis used fluorescent properties of the marine animal and developed a luminous smile .
the idea came when he read a scientific treatise on medúze , and persuaded scientists in china to chemically produced protein that causes the phosphorescence .
this ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer - increases the ph levels of the protein , and subsequently causes the radiation .
chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth , and therefore the more lick , the more september .
charlie , the founder of an ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; ( olízni me taste great ) , says : &quot; it &apos;s an amazing substance , but in terms of production , we are at the beginning , so you &apos;ll get £ 200 for about 2 g of this substance . &quot;
the protein , which we use in the ice cream , reacts with your tongue at neutral ph .
so how your mouth heat protein , increasing the ph levels and the ice cream is beginning to glow .
testovali it over the last few months , and it seems to be a great idea for the celebration of halloween , because this is a fantastic , brilliant effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i &apos;ve ever made , because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .
and so i every hillock costs about £ 140 .
but it tastes good .
charlie &apos;s experimental company based in bristol , is known for its non-traditional flavors of beer , cheese , beef and leaves of gold .
but his next product to be even more ambitious .
he says : &quot; i really wish to make an invisible ice cream . &quot;
in essence , this is impossible because of the effects of light caused by ice crystals , which make up the ice cream , but i suppose that , a way to do it , we can find .
ice cream is using fluorescent properties of jellyfish , artificially produced by chinese scientists .

martin doktor of problems with the olympic games in sochi : communication with the russians is demanding
his mouth koutky indicate a slight smile and then just a deep says : &quot; it is difficult . &quot;
cooperation with the organisational team for the olympics in sochi 2014 , according to dr. martin is a little more complicated .
what was at the last olympics , we can forget it .
&quot; nothing works as well , &quot; says the head of the czech olympic mission .
what exactly is going on ?
a number of things are more slowly and not exactly .
it is such a confusing .
from the point of view of the invoices are relatively fast , in terms of supplying information on the fundamental things , not so much .
maybe páčíme from them for three months to give us , as will be officially marked the village , we could do in a whole range of things .
we are still waiting , and they still say that the thing they communicate .
in a number of things still communicate with each other .
is already at least finished the olympic village ?
but it is not a disastrous situation .
a month ago , we walked the empty rooms .
fortunately , the houses .
what does it mean that they are empty ?
they are to be finished the floor ?
only the concrete , so that was the status of a month ago .
but they still have the time .
even if there is a danger that when we get there , 26 january as the vanguard , there will still feel the glue .
and if we weren &apos;t , so will be what ?
president putin would mean the army drove there ?
that &apos;s the way it would be .
it was not just that the olympic village = potěmkinovy village .
rather , there is a risk that would , for example , the adjustment of the roads , nedodělají details .
maybe they will be travelling in such a state that we will have to take with him the boots of the london games .
but i believe that it will give up .
how many of the czech athletes could go to sochi ?
now , there are roughly 78 , though depending on the criteria of the nomination competitions number .
maybe skaters probably will go in the trio of what had taken place .
o rychlobruslařce martina sáblíkové , nobody has any doubt , but otherwise it &apos;s a work in progress .
still awaits you trip to sochi ?
no , if nothing happens , i should go there until january 26 .
how will look like houses in the olympic village , we know .
indeed , some of the things we measured the subway to believe only drawing .
we &apos;re preparing as well as a number of other things , including transport .
and what does the head of the mission a hundred days before the olympic games ?
i &apos;m preparing for the annual evaluation of individual olympic sports , plus i &apos;m doing a routine agenda in terms of communication with the organising committee in sochi .
instead of the post-election sirloin post-election stew
the october elections rather than the winner has brought a bunch of losers .
it &apos;s not just the parties that are not even in the chamber of deputies ( e.g. spoz ) , but also the previous government party ( ods ) , top 09 ) and eventually Čssd because of their internal division .
politicians are instead of festive sirloin has served up on the weekend of the post-election stew .
springer elections became the movement of andrei babiše , which promised voters to change the political style of governance .
roztříštěnost election result and a schism in the winning side plays into the hands of the political ( of ) the willingness of mr president miloš zeman , regardless of the wishes of the voters who side that president zeman publicly supported or get elected to the house of commons .
the president was due to the unpleasant events lost the strategic policy ahead of the others , but there are still a few ways to get it back - for example , by selecting the future prime minister .
while the social democrats , the chances of obtaining the prime minister in my eyes away , entrepreneurs andreju babišovi the opposite approach .
while povolební development is still miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government , but compared with the pre-election scenario of left-wing governments Čssd supported by the communists , is this development for business in the czech republic and hence the economy had better news .
given the loud opposition yes to get together with the ods and top 09 , is still the most likely scenario coalition of the social democrats , ano and the kdu-Čsl ( a total of 111 mps ) .
given the schism in the social democrats , which has thus become unreadable and weak parterem in the negotiations , the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be pretty depressing for Čssd .
the government minoritní Čssd composed with &quot; nezemanovců &quot; at the castle probably get away with it .
in addition , any government that the social democrats will participate , will be threatened by unmet ambition of many of the socialist group , which may lead sooner or later to another schism in the party .
so , i ask myself : &quot; nespějeme gravity to other early elections ? &quot;
another option would have been more of a referendum on the strength of electoral mandate of the yes .
these plans for the implementation of sectoral taxes , raising taxes on income or building a state-owned bank , fell hopefully under the table .
the social democrats , yes , kdu-Čsl and dawn , in turn , agree , for example , to promote entrepreneurship , moderate fiscal policy ( government deficit below 3 % of gdp ) , to promote the employment of disadvantaged people , the lower rates of vat on selected goods .
friction surfaces are most prevalent in view of social policy and the size of the state .
yes , but now has the upper hand , so the program so far , the most likely coalition yes , Čssd , kdu-Čsl would be leaning more to the right .
which , in my view , it is ultimately a better outcome than the left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving .
until recently , it seemed that the majority of citizens in the czech republic wanted early elections .
the reasons have been given of corruption , the squandering of money on overpriced purchases and government procurement , tax increases and government scandals .
according to the results of the elections can be concluded that the majority of the citizens of this state suit .
in fact , it didn &apos;t matter to them and to the state of the ( theft and indebtedness of the state ) , they were really happy .
otherwise , i can &apos;t explain that 3 413 497 voters have stayed away from the elections , 596 357 voters voted for the top 09 384 174 voters voted for the ods a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original ruling coalition , which represents 52,16 % of all legitimate voters .
which is an absolute majority .
in addition to the above-mentioned parties 1 016 829 voters Čssd , then the old order ( because all the parties have been involved in the &quot; theft &quot; and the indebtedness of the state ) , then with this condition actually agreed 64,23 % of legitimate voters .
this , in fact , a majority of voters have made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty rozkradení and over-indebtedness of this state .
or you think that the members of the social democrats , who are involved in this endeavour , the appropriate laws ?
it is to help us ?
olomouc opens in the historic center of public skating rink
the organizer of the olomouc christmas markets and winter skating pavel spálený said that the preparatory work on the ice rink was launched on october 26 , and from wednesday &apos;s ice-making plant in operation .
the ice layer is already strong seven centimeters , and by friday morning , the area will be ready for the first visitors .
kluziště has an area of 375 square meters , took the podium 358 square meters .
bruslaři and passers-by will also be available to two stalls with a punch .
&quot; we &apos;ve rozšířili floor space , increased the space in front of the stalls and almost the entire area of the podium was enshrined in a way that skaters can &apos;t change comfortably , &quot; described spálený .
the streets of olomouc , reminiscent of the approaching christmas .
last year , the rink was due to the repair of lower square installed directly in front of the main entrance hall on the upper square .
correction of lower square was completed at the end of the summer , so the ice could go back to its original location .
for the first time , people can skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009 , when it was skating rink in operation from january to march .
ice surface is then become an integral part of the christmas markets in the city .
christmas markets , which include a rich cultural program , will be on the upper square started a month before christmas .
scientists more throw light on how the movements of the tail is linked to the mood of the dog
earlier research has shown that the radiant dog wags more transport ( from the point of view of a dog ) , while the nervous dogs waving tail largely left .
now , however , scientists say that other dogs can these subtle differences in the movement of the tail to record and respond to them .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a from the university of trento said : &quot; in humans , it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different link to the incentives that create a positive or negative emotions . &quot;
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to see in other species .
he added that , as is the case with the people , even in dogs is the right side of the brain responsible for levoruké movements and vice versa , and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotion .
in an effort to obtain more information about how the dogs respond to asymmetric wiggling tail of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals watched films of other dogs .
měřili heart rate of these animals and analyze their behavior .
it will not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes , on the one hand , and sometimes on the other .
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we promítli dogs films about dogs - whether in the natural version , or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing incentives , and we could also adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate it more to the right or left . &quot;
when the animals could see otherwise lackluster dog &apos;s tail move right ( from the perspective of a dog &apos;s tail vrtějícího ) , remained quite calm .
but when the tail has largely left ( again from the point of view of a dog &apos;s tail vrtějícího ) , their heart rate has increased and the animals were uncertain .
professor vallortigara said he does not believe that the dogs through these movements knowingly communicate with each other .
rather , he believes that the dogs have learned from experience that movements have and which does not need to be careful .
he said : &quot; if you several times with the dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to a more friendly behavior and movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior , you will respond on the basis of this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that the findings are the owners of dogs , vets and cvičitelům to help better understand the emotions of their animals .
the expert on the behavior of dogs , john bradshaw , a university teacher of veterinary medicine at the university of bristol , said that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side for dogs .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln found that dogs away his head to the left , when watching an aggressive dog , and right , when looking at the jolly dog .
and in another professional paper from the university of victoria in canada , said : &quot; with the dog robot dogs are more likely to show when wagging his tail to the left than the right , which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite , compared to the italian study . &quot;
the difference may be given to him by dogs in these various studies of animals in movies or dog robots were talking quite like dogs .
vysvětlil that might help the study of how dogs respond to the real dogs .
&quot; although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details are still to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
but given how easy it is to record their behaviour , probably won &apos;t be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other .
rbs suspended two traders with a foreign currency
according to two people familiar with the situation suspended the royal bank of scotland ( rbs ) , two traders in their division with a foreign currency , which is another indication that the global investigation of the supervisory authorities concerning the shady things with the currency market is becoming increasingly common .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that cooperate with the competent authorities on investigations of the largest financial market in the world , where every day is changing owners of 5.3 trillion .
zmínění two traders would be the first rbs staff suspended as part of an expanding investigation , which is a response to the scandal involving the manipulation of libor ( the london inter-bank interest rate ) .
the bank declined to comment on the suspension , but confirmed that this month has received a request for information from the authorities .
&quot; our continuing search continues in this matter and we cooperate fully with the fca and our other bodies , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , the people who are close to the event , said that rbs had forwarded the british financial conduct authority records of e-mails and instant messages sent from the accounts and the accounts of the former trader .
the businessman , richard usher , left rbs in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position of the european head of foreign currency trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , the chairman of the trade for cash at citi , took a vacation this week , while matt gardiner , a former manager for trade with currencies in barclays and ubs , was suspended this week by standard chartered .
neither of these traders has not been accused of any wrongdoing .
the group of mr usher for sending instant messages were bankers from barclays and citigroup , said the people to this event .
the bank ubs , this week said that after the swiss control authority finma announced that had been investigating shady on the market with a foreign currency in several swiss banks , has taken action against some of its employees .
worldwide , at least six offices - the european commission , finma , the swiss antitrust authority weko , the fca , the ministry of justice in the us and the hong kong monetary authority - is examining allegations that these bankers would conspire to move the currency market .
people familiar with the situation said that hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also launched an internal investigation , or from the competent authorities received a request for information .
the banks are combing the years old with quick messages and e-mails to find cases of some offences .
reports of investigations startled traders in the area , which was one of the biggest engines for profit in the accounts of investment banks in recent years , but that was disrupted by a small currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators .
some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation , said that with a large and highly liquid market with a foreign currency is virtually impossible to manipulate , but senior traders say it may not necessarily be true .
the senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading in foreign currency dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing use of their own internal platforms means that &quot; you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices . &quot;
the report came on the same day that the company credit suisse announced that this week &apos;s release of his department for trading in shares of the trader , who at the end of last year , has caused a loss of almost $ 6 million .
the bank immediately alerted the authorities and cooperate with their control authorities .
&quot; we are convinced that the trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved , &quot; said company credit suisse .

&quot; but the desire to show everyone is still in me , &quot; he says firmly .
there may be , it is alleged to the new york rangers , who had been a failure to enter into the season , and they have wounded two mainstays - attackers rick nash and ryan callahan .
how &apos;s your arrival in the rangers look like ?
they are just speculation .
until i have something on paper , so it &apos;s not worth considering .
i know that the article in the new york post that he would have to sign me , but that &apos;s all .
there had been delivered that it really happened .
unfortunately , i would like to announce that i have a contract , but that &apos;s just the way it is .
nor did you from the club ?
such communication in the nhl takes place every day .
it is about to get into a situation where the contract really coming .
when will be hurt a player or that someone is not a team ever .
there are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get the contract .
but in new york , a similar circumstances arise , isn &apos;t it ?
the injured man is rick nash and ryan callahan and the team failed to enter the season , so there is a chance , don &apos;t you think ?
of course , there is always the chance .
but the second thing is that you always need two sides .
i took a lot of offers today , but i haven &apos;t got one .
that is , unfortunately , the reality in which i have to live .
on friday , you are flying to america , you are in the expectation that something might work after all ?
i have the expectations since july 5 , when the nhl &apos;s free-market players , and still nothing .
you &apos;re going to new york to be reminded ?
absolutely not , i am going to tampa for the kids and a wife .
i am looking forward to the sun and when we meet again .
somehow you have planned his program ?
this is the fact that i am the father and husband , and from that , everything .
at the moment , i &apos;m not a hockey player - i don &apos;t have a contract and i don &apos;t play games .
so i &apos;m going to play the role of my dad and husband and i &apos;m really looking forward to it .
already on sunday vašík has two hockey games , that is for me and my whole family holiday , when we can go to support our children about what they want to do .
přemýšlíte that you could do this in quotation marks on a full-time ?
sure , you can think about a lot of things .
even this may occur .
i &apos;ve vyzkoušel three years ago , when i missed 50 games because of knee surgery .
and the power and i enjoyed it .
once it gets to the stage that all the goals , the victory and passes you replace what you have at home .
as the family and children , that is the meaning of life .
whether you have a job , what you want .
i had a job that she was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me , in addition to the family .
you had a lot of offers from europe : you have that you want to play the nhl because it is the nhl , or is it because of the family that you want to be in america ?
since i &apos;m a hockey player , in the first place - in addition to the family - including sporting success .
nhl is the best competition in the world .
and since that is a family life .
my children , so sorry , our children - my and my wife - grow up in the united states , began to go to school , and so on .
and we would be very happy if this trend continued .
because what we tell ourselves in america , there are options elsewhere .
we should offer them a chance .
if you &apos;re planning to stay in america permanently ?
we &apos;re going to practice as now .
this means that we will be in the summer in the czech republic in hluboká and in the vicinity of ceske budejovice .
and in the winter in tampa , or wherever they take us our steps .
this is absolutely ideal , still be warm .
i was very lucky in my life .
you could say that i went to meet him , it was worth a lot of strength and self-denial and took me a lot of things that i missed .
but hockey , in turn , offered me a lot of opportunities , and this is one of them .
to a woman , we can choose where we live .
there are a lot of people who are hungry for this , so that they can choose what they do and how they live .
as long as you have in your age will work hard , work hard and wait for an offer ?
yeah , it is a question that i can &apos;t answer that .
today , i still have it in him , the juice , the passion , the enthusiasm , the passion for the sport tu desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the nhl that i was still better than anyone else .
but i can &apos;t tell you how long it will stay there .
it is not to plan .
so you might say that this season wait what happens and then you decide what to do next ?
i &apos;m at the stage where i go from day to day .

the brutal murder of seniora on zlínsku will once again to the county court
the county court acquitted five slovak and 22-year-old english for lack of evidence .
the men refused to blame .
is there a danger of 15 to 20 years in prison , or even unusual punishment .
the spokesman petr angyalossy confirmed that the high court decision to abolish county and returned him to discuss the matter .
the reasons that led to the judge , declined to comment on the fact that the decision has not yet been served on the parties .
according to the indictment , the young men attacked sedmasedmdesátiletého man in his house .
senior died an agonising death .
according to the indictment , the man strangled , beaten and kicked all over the body , as well as a metal object , probably a gas pistol , planted about three dozens of blows to the head .
the man suffered serious injuries , such as skull fractures , brain swelling or bleeding in the brain , which died on the spot .
mladíci had allegedly carried out of the house about 3,000 crowns and jewellery worth about 14 thousand crowns .
according to the district court were the only , and only indirect evidence against the defendants scent , which experts assessed as not fully identified in terms of legal guidelines .
pachové clues from the crime scene and other matters , though in more than 10 cases , to coincide with the defendants , but the police initially treated with them as a factual and not scent marks .
in addition , it found some errors in dealing with them .
according to the senate was not the fault of the defendants without a doubt .
the court , however , acknowledged that the police had a very difficult conditions .
the dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought that apparently fell and injured himself .
on the violent death of a doctor could not cast by rescue services .
so after a few days of kriminalisty contacted olomoučtí doctors who during the autopsy found signs of violent death .
the police could no longer work with all the clues from the crime scene that relatives had cleaned up .
on the site , there has been no dna defendants .

the man was in his head , organized a group of six young men , which is responsible for jewelry robberies .
robberies took place in october and november 2011 , shortly after the murder of the elderly in slopném .
the younger of the accused of the murder of senior lives in uherské hradiště .
the court was dismissed in august after 11 months of detention .
the czech television obejde , sometimes without a specimen of actions ?
in the era of president zeman stepped the legendary scene with popelníčkem , and it is not hard to listen to the complaints , which collects evidence favouring the company .
in the past , the impact of such tradovaný ivan langer or jaroslav tvrdík nobody had not documented in this way , let alone to sign it .
true , the leadership stop the editors .
such cases , however , do not provide an answer to the question of where such affection of some journalists to zemanovcům takes - whether it is a response to a direct order , or , to use the language , a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic embrace .
and we assume the general prohnilost , you cannot forgive the question of whether to change the situation on television becoming another , equally unscrupulous power interests , which has not yet received an opportunity .
the truth are those who say that in developed countries , to the obvious attempts at intervention politicians in the broadcast .
the truth is , however , that this does not mean that there would be no complaints about the public media .
the complainants do not call into question their independence .
on the other hand , kritizují mainly what they consider tendenčnost , which is owned by them , which is the fruit of their subculture .
maybe we &apos;re just not there yet in this civilizational stage , and this situation is not with us .
perhaps , but also in the country , which he thinks that it is the most corrupt in the world , the black-and-white tales of bad politicians and good journalists spends more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of the chaotic situation in which he was referring to the behavior of many imperfect human beings .
while in cardiff to collect the experts on the demonstration of horses to fight for the price of the horse of the year , it was clear to all that the competition will not be easy .
but no one was not ready for the three-year-old fenton kirkland .
although still do not go to school , and only a few months ago , took the first steps , this little boy and his pet animal , shetland pony toffee , smoothly proklusali three rounds to win the prize at the end and left behind 30 shuffling adult rivals .
the peas and carrots - the same height - has been at the center of the annual competition run by riding in the village of sunnybank rudry near cardiff commended for appearance , behaviour and style .
he stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats , how his beret into a funny angle , leaving his two-year-old toffeeho parade on the circuit .
fenton was the jury praised for their natural ability to control the horse , which far outweigh its age .
and toffee earned the highest marks for insight and personality .
fenton toffeeho came in march to their third birthday , and since then with this shetlandským pony train every day .
his mother , donna ( 30 ) , she said : &quot; fenton and toffee great together . &quot;
they had high hopes , but eventually walked away with the gold cup and bouquet .
it was only the second time with toffeem compete , and when he won , we were delighted .
all he was a phenomenal and totally alien people wanted a picture with him .
the boy from the village of nantyglo near ebbw vale in south wales comes in the wake of her aunt sharon howells , which shows the horses for more than 10 years .
ms howellsová says : &quot; it was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and clapped . &quot;
he ran across the sand along the entire length of the arena , and even though he was so small , gave a great performance .
fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses , tractors and farm and was in charge of two chickens .
given the way he will be back soon to competition horse of the year and i am sure he will do well .
the spokesman of the annual competition show horses , he said : &quot; there are only three fentonovi , but he knows how to control the pony . &quot;
together they are a great team .
jurors picked up fenton and toffeeho for their excellent speech and for the way the show on the competitive circuit .
always follow good teamwork between the pony and the one who leads him - and fenton with toffeem were on ovals best .
i &apos;m sure that helped fentonovi and cute clothes really fit in there with him .

edward snowden , a rat from american intelligence services , announced that he is willing to go to berlin to give evidence to the german parliament , if the us national security agency and its director keith alexander will not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities .
german mep hans-christian sträbele on thursday met with mr snowdenem in russia , where he was granted asylum , and acted with him about the possibility to testify in germany .
in a letter from mr snowdena , who has been a member of the media on friday in berlin , states : &quot; although the outcome of my efforts has been shown to be positive , the government will continue to opposition behaves like the defectors and trying to criminalise political speeches heavy claims that don &apos;t make room for defence . &quot;
speak the truth , however , is not a crime .
in this letter , mr snowden said he believes that the support of the international community would be able to convince the government of the united states to withdraw criminal charges brought against him .
the charges brought by the ministry of justice of the united states include espionage and theft of government property .
hans-peter friedrich , the german interior minister , said the magazine zeit online : &quot; if mr. snowden is ready to talk with german officials , we will find a way to allow it . &quot;

if mr. snowden testified in germany , would need assurances that there would be a &quot; safe , &quot; said a member of parliament .
mr. snowden said in his letter that he faced harsh and persistent campaign of persecution , which forced him to leave home .

to nezalknul hatred
the writer václav kahuda , after twelve years back to writing .
after long years when he was alive , but he did not write , issued by václav kahuda ( 1965 ) , the new novel wind , dark presence .
that won &apos;t be a slim volume , suggests the number of parties comparable to his best-known work houština ( petrov , 2001 ) .
for the salon kahudu questioned another significant czech writer present - emil hakl .
what is it where you &apos;re after twelve years of silence , he wrote a novel ?
i did it - to nezalknul hatred .
seeing around still new and new clones of the human foolish vanity , young organisms affected blind selfish endeavors .
about us older or not , faces wrecked helpless lust , vekslácké soul and vice versa přepólovaní ideologues who are trying to look a little harlot sell its &quot; product . &quot;
at the beginning of the millennium , i bought a small digital camera and filmed his jurodivé friends , eccentrics and secret services .
i got over it .
sometimes i feel of my life on this planet &apos;s brain .
she wanted to go for a walk and then in the evening i read books .
you &apos;re talking about the sense of doom , hatred .
he was somewhere in the past , a watershed that affect you , or just getting old , too , like the rest of us ?
the break came a long time ago , roughly in ten years .
at the time , it did not name .
well , and after that i lived .
somewhere in there is still surprised by the quiet boy .
i see a further isolated cvikýře , each in his tornado anxiety .
zachránilo me writing books .
Účastním this huge , thousands of years of the movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of the discipline of the future .
the enormous , with breathtaking complexity of life , where every stone is a direct heir of our presence .
we are sad and beautiful game players , when there is a trial-and-error on the next and the next generation being in biliónech interactions per second creates a superhuman , artificiální intelligence .
twelve years is a relatively long time .
vnímáš his writing as an ongoing process , or did you start from scratch ?
samomluva , or rather , the dialogue that leads right and left half of the brain , sometimes floats and forged in the book .
as a period of peace are laced with sleeping quietly metastases wars that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence , all dressed in words .
i felt my dumb avalanche of life is growing in the brain , and if i don &apos;t do anything , so one day i will bury quietly .
it is a set of questions that formulated the brain and by the classes , which are stored in the darkness &quot; below the surface of consciousness . &quot;
neokortex , gray , asks the older evolutionary departments , goes to the ancient letokruhům brain tree .
speaking to srstnatým beasts , asks the snakes , looking for an answer in the flight of birds , raised his eyes to the clouds in the sky .
yes , the moral law within me and the starry sky above me .
finally , the brain wonders of the world .
the relatively often you speak to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically ?
the brain stores in their billions of connections and electrochemical connections to all the memories , experiences and the experiences that the man had lived .
logically , this forest and emotionally exposed to and branching trees information registers of memory , the brain uses in its recognition , cognitive , process , being exposed to the constantly changing presence , in a constant efforts to try to identify and understand the importance of their surroundings and decode messages .
sometimes there are problems of the congestion .
by analogy - as if they &quot; fell &quot; pc , from the speech emulator and translator of foreign languages , you messed up first in the operating environment , such as windows , and after several unsuccessful restartech ended up in the dark green flickering screen biosu , in a system that controls functions and cooperation onboard , between the processor and the memory , etc .
for those who have not yet understood what this is about - i am talking about psychospirituální crisis .
zmiňuješ is often about it - why you are interested in this type of recourse regularly ?
because it is a pit .
in the most functional mechanisms of our thinking , feeling and behavior - a break .
here is a good quote nietzsche : &quot; so long stared into the abyss , the abyss to look into it . &quot;
the sheer sense - that man is lost when they disappear all hope , mentally &quot; die &quot; and a new quality .
and why it interests me personally ?
i &apos;ll answer parable .
once one fell into the pool and drowned , the days , months and years , he is still drowning and read , and the books have taught him to swim - that is , live .
he became &quot; a diver . &quot;
perhaps someone will help me a written sentence , as once helped hrabalovy texts me .
to what extent do you think of the reader to a specific person who will read your text ?
the one of which is not to say anything meaningful , some call it the knowledge of other super-ego , but it seems to me that the best characterized arthur rimbaud , in a letter to a friend :
&quot; i is someone else - this reader contributes directly to the formulation of the words and phrases . &quot;
from an early age he read books the old czech fairy tales , sailed in captain nemo &apos;s submarine , running after stínadlech in dark alleys .
finally , anyway , behind all this branching authors and their message is : &quot; the sun bright worlds of other core karl cliff . &quot;
and when the book is out ?
do you care about čtenářově view ?
on the rebound , which is to you over the people who read the book gets ?
of course , it depends on the opinion of those who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text .
and even then , after years of contact randomly on the street and thank me for my book helped them in some of their heavy life decisions .
the books are in fact &quot; lives , &quot; or rather &quot; worlds . &quot;
the characters are coded letters , the experience , the history of the regions of the language .
whenever we can revive when we leave their sentences flow to the brain .
in fact , it is , in a way , something forbidden the divine - waking up more and more life stories , small universes and temporary planet .
it is the fact that dna is stored in the lines , according to the old démonologických books make witchcraft .
after the publication of a book you - as it is - a chain of copyright reading .
i remember that you once to read .
vrhneš do it again with pleasure , or feel that after years of otherwise ?
today , i &apos;d rather just tell .
and what i found out ?
there are good , intelligent people .
their basic character - are discreet , too , is to provide a friendly , you don &apos;t feel lonely with them .
here &apos;s an example - he has lived in the town of Červený kostelec ( and i hope that he is still alive ) , a curly-haired bookseller ( his name is conveniently Červenka ) , a cheerful fellow and a good girls &apos; bull .
in one pijatyce introduced me to individual articles of the chain of readers of my books houština .
i looked them in the eye and then i was shown tattered trench , očtený copy of my book .
embarrassed , i just put down the middle of jitrnici and briefly male wept .
we all stood there in silence , billowing and drunkenly with emotion were moved .
then it &apos;s the young blond mongrel broke down and jumped over the head with a roar from a window into a snowdrift .
it was on the ground floor .
we ran into a landscape and jatí happy rabies citlivců , aching souls wandering fellows working smallhold farms and longing remote patriots - howling gales and how werewolves until morning .
each of your book is formally and materially different than the others .
it is also about the text of the wind , dark presence ?
it is a story .
it is a tale of one country heigh-ho , heigh-ho rivers and mountains .
ivan bunin , in his amendment suchodol , czech republic inserted into the mouth of the popular healer words of an old russian myth : at sea on the ocean , on the island of bujanu .
it lies psice , on her gray chest .
the horror , the horror , secret .
it never happened , but we all know you .
maybe we were a long time ago devils in hell and lots - what role we play in this country .
are you going to write , or keep it again on the free flow of inspiration ?
the answers are eternal - otokar březina .
writing is a wonderful way of dialogue .
something huge and nameless , like the movement of continents on the planet , affects our sensibility of the depth and breadth of that completely beyond our horizon - and so as a matter of course we act strictly in terms of your programmed award .
we are rewarded the influx of dopamine , a mixture of endorphins and other substances .
we are the biological machines .
we want to mate , we die in defense and the acquisition of new passenger territories .
sometimes disorder and the glow of sympathy .
only then we have the right to call the people .
this is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders , standing on the shore of the ocean and in holes in their sails made of a dirty handkerchief catching inflows warm wind .
i have to write to be a man .
schools should focus more on the math , spelling and grammar
in the hours of english literature will need to examine at least one of shakespeare &apos;s plays , the novel of the 19th-century romantic poetry and contemporary british fiction since 1914 .
the test will also include a &quot; hidden text &quot; to motivate a deeper reading ;
the combined courses in english literature and language will be abolished .
from 2015 , from students will be required to have a graduation exam of the language , and they will be encouraged to choose english literature as an optional subject .
tomorrow , the ministry of education should issue a new curriculum for english and math - the first items to undergo a radical change .
in the other major objects are waiting for changes next year .
in a separate step , ofqual authority , which oversees the graduation test detects changes in the structure of the graduation test , together with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students .
in his speech in the summer of secretary of state for education michael gove said that there is &quot; broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our system of rehearsal to regain the confidence of the company &quot; and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test was &quot; more demanding , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
the study shows that the english schools spend less time mathematics - 116 hours a year , or three hours a week - than most other countries .
for comparison schools in australia are paying mathematics 143 hours per year on average , and in singapore about 138 .
although there will be no official request to devote more time mathematics , coalition sources have indicated that the comprehensive graduation test of mathematics - along with greater emphasis on this subject in the result rankings - is likely to encourage schools to provide extra classes .
the plan will focus more on &quot; the problems of the real world , &quot; including financial mathematics .
ostrava mayor kajnar : i &apos;m not rakovinou in Čssd
before the election , is fully ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings of fighting for influence within the ostrava Čssd .
all in when the mayor of ostrava petr kajnar turned to court because of the undemocratic compilation of candidates .
actors cases still didn &apos;t want to comment too much to the party before the election even more damaging .
now , however , the votes are numbered .
the management of the ostrava Čssd so right on monday evening , called on the mayor of the city of ostrava to come out of the party and will probably push to lose its function .
but petr kajnar wants to fight on .
what is in disputes and who is on whose side , described in an exclusive interview to the daily news .
how do you see the outcome of the election ?
Čssd be counted with a much better result .
poškodilo it with us to address the media before the election disputes within the party ?
i imagine that the social democracy could have a better electoral outcome .
but on the other hand , it is the state in which one it is now .
it is a party that has its own internal problems , it is inherently sick and people don &apos;t see that it &apos;s not all right .
i have made it clear in the elections .
what are the internal disease Čssd ?
the decline for some time , according to the ods through me and things like that , unfortunately , is now taking place in social democracy .
it is true that lobbyists , influential people who previously expected its prebendy find in the ods , moved to the people in Čssd and have influence on them .
it then has to do with the fact that the offices of the city &apos;s airport police and collects computers .
it shows that the social democrats is not composed only of people who would like to the benefit of all the others , but many of them are thinking above all to the good .
Čssd is divided into two opposing camps in prague , as can be seen in the current struggle for power between haškovci and sobotkovci .
that , too , but prepared for a long time .
what happened before the elections in ostrava , was only a foretaste of what is happening now in prague .
haškovo wing gradually obsazovalo positions , then after the election , it could cause a situation that will weaken sobotkovo wing .
a man is in politics in a situation where sometimes has to compromise .
but everyone has an internal border , when you don &apos;t make compromises , and this is also my case .
originally , i didn &apos;t want to run in the house , but when i saw the whole thing inside the party , so i agreed with lubošem zaorálkem would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen as mayor of ostrava sobotkovo right wing .
haškovo wing but it could stop .
why are you standing on the side of the bohuslav sobotka , and not michael haška ?
slávek sobotka , to me , is a man who always speaks mainly on the social democrats and , to some extent , the visions for the party and for the country .
i confess that from the other side , i haven &apos;t heard anything like that .
michael village just fighting for power .
i don &apos;t understand how can the bureau , which is lower than the central authority of the executive committee , to just dismiss the chairman of the party .
this is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the articles of association .
i think what now michal hašek demonstrated in prague , ended his political career .
how did you feel that you did the ostrava leadership Čssd on the candidate .
political parties are based on competition , who are both in their members be placed .
the competition should be largely based on programming visions and the ability of those people to fill the vision .
of course , in this competition , and the people who do not have a lot of ability and vision , but the political party is for them a lift to the money that would have gotten elsewhere .
the problem is that these people begin to get to the fore because unscrupulously violating the rules violate the constitution of the party .
its practices are from the political parties , the mafia and i think they are violating the laws of the czech republic .
alert me on this issue is more important to me than to take into account whether some kajnar has a political future .
it is important that the parties began to respect the statutes .
that is why you are handed a proposal before the election to the court for interim measures against a nominee Čssd v moravskoslezském kraji ?
the current district executive committee Čssd in ostrava , consolidating his power by organizations that do not meet him , he can cancel , of the new organization is based , gradually firing uncomfortable members of the party .
an example is that they wanted to exclude richard bednaříka from representatives of the club , but he has filed a lawsuit against it and then they resolution on his exclusion rather canceled .
this shows that to enforce compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option , but when the other ways and supervisory bodies inside the Čssd stopped working , it is the only option .
the aim of the ostrava Čssd led by a member of the adam rykalou &apos;s appeal to you from the position of the mayor .
it is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post poruby lumír palyza .
so , adam rykala and lumír palyza is trying to do everything possible to ensure that they could appeal to me .
slibují people positions , gaining votes , and then those voices are consolidating their power in the party .
when i go back to the past , so everything that happened to be around the football club baník ostrava and the purchase of the stadium bazala , was just a pretext for them to strike at me .
it was artificially staged , that i could be described as a man who gives money where it doesn &apos;t belong .
at the same time , the city bought the property , which is of great strategic value for him .
so how do you see on to his remaining as mayor of ?
the district committee for me and other people on monday urged to consider their continuance in Čssd .
but i think it &apos;s as if a thief crying : &quot; stop thief !
when we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years , so i don &apos;t see anyone in the ostrava social democracy , who initiated and pushed through , sometimes against members of the party , the emergence of so many developing things , such as industrial zones , or the expansion of science and technology park .
still , everything i become inconvenient .
i don &apos;t read it differently than to interrupt the others , to the point where they want .
you will still have to fight against these efforts ?
because if the republic of this work well , they must work well and political parties .
it &apos;s hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state , if he can &apos;t drive or itself .
neuvažuji , therefore , that i have now left the social democrats , because i think that whoever causes cancer this side , not me , but those people who are trying to remove me .
we want to show that the plzeň can still win , rajtoral promises
it is a bit of a paradox .
while his team is mainly results recently , a defender or midfielder victoria plzen františek rajtoral has the form that earned him a return to the team after a year .
he is also them , carousing activity , after surgery on him in the match in teplice ordered the penalty kick .
the balloon came in the last two rounds against slavii and in teplice after the victory , but in the end of these two duels took a single point .
františek rajtoral believes that his team in the game with jabloncem unpleasant series of breaks .
we want to show that we can win .
&quot; i believe that the jablonec beat at home , &quot; says františek rajtoral .
the men on the difficult struggle with severočechy who play offensive football , carefully prepared .
everything points to match with jabloncem , coach prepares us well , as always we draw a lot of videorozboru game rivals .
&quot; i believe that it will be a great game on friday night , &quot; attracts the personal representative of the czech fans in the grandstand doosan arena .
pilsen last matches have gone wrong in the way it wants , but the word crisis defender victoria rejects .
that &apos;s the way it goes in football , sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse .
but the crisis , i would not in any case .
&quot; i believe that we can win on friday , and it will be good again , &quot; says defender západočechů .
the victoria will once again rely on the support of the fans .
&quot; it is played on friday evening and that i would like our fans , who are great , to invite . &quot;
&quot; i believe that they odvděčíme win , &quot; adds rajtoral .
braňte academic freedom , it is true for zeman and the ods .
i have repeatedly in recent months , called on the open letters to students , educators and the leadership of the middle and high schools in several counties to defend academic freedom before the election campaign , which was conducted in schools , president milos zeman .
i setkával with more or less success .
rektorovi masaryk university in brno , who refused to lecture an honorary chairman of spoz - zemanovci in the pre-election period , even after it received retaliation in the form of nepozvání to celebrate the national holiday of the czech republic .
here is a list of the schools , who have been so brave and visit to allow the rain man : high technical university in brno , gymnázium hladnov in ostrava , high school of entrepreneurship in ostrava , business academy in cologne , university of j.e. purkyně in usti nad labem .
now , in pardubice encounter with the continuation of promoting policies at universities .
the newly elected member of the ods , dean of the faculty of electrical engineering and computer science , university of pardubice , simeon karamazov , refuses to resign from his academic functions , and it seems to be normal .
professor , it really isn &apos;t the same as if you had stayed in office , for example , the mayor of a small town .
do you want to add to the regional presidents Čssd who vykovávají at the same time as the members and general and as they degrade the profession ?
this is because people say that can handle both of these difficult functions .
i know we have the example of michael jaroslav hašek , which handles even a few dozen functions at once .
but that probably isn &apos;t exactly an example of a person that you should follow .
we &apos;ll find the opposite , and a positive example of dr. Štěpánky fraňkové , who preferred to leave the parliamentary post to fully pay the city of pardubice .
the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean &apos;s office , however , is that the combination of the functions you break apolitičnost academic land of the university of pardubice .
the management of the various ods sees your current action on both posts as an advantage for the university .
&quot; their &quot; school , however , you will be able to help without you stay the dean .
i think i have a similar view as the rector of miroslav ludwig , will also have your students .
thus , still consider his resignation and keep his face .
otherwise , you may be that you deal with voters in the next election .
and it may not be long-lasting .
john kerry admitted : Špehování has gone too far .
the united states have gone in spying sometimes &quot; too far , &quot; he said , according to the agency , afp chief of american diplomacy , john kerry during a video conference between washington and london .
the collection of information but , according to the minister served to prevent terrorist attacks .
&quot; the first confessions from washington , &quot; according to the afp came amid fierce controversy on both sides of the atlantic because of the scandalous revelations of mass surveillance data , the u.s. national security agency ( nsa ) , whose targets have become even american allies .
&quot; in some cases , i admit , as did the president ( barack obama ) , some of these actions have gone too far , assuring that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; said kerry .
in an interview , but above all , defended the practice .
the collection of information as it is essential to the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations , such as the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , in the us , the bombings in madrid in march 2004 and in london in july 2005 .
&quot; we &apos;ve zabránili so that the plane fell , the building exploded and people were murdered , because we were able to be informed about the úkladech in time , &quot; said kerry .
however , he admitted that the collection of information &quot; in some cases went too far . &quot;
american intelligence about the affair , which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of telephone calls , broke out in europe this month .
among other things , it turned out that the americans were watching the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel .
european leaders were openly indignation , and some of them have asked the european union to try to reach an agreement with the united states , which would have been monitoring or significantly reduced .
the royal commission heard that before the claims against jonathan lords were accused of two employees of the young men &apos;s christian association ( ymca )
the royal commission on the sexual abuse of children learned that before charges against child educators jonathan caringbah lord of the city in 2011 , two employees of the young men &apos;s christian association ( ymca ) in new south wales were in charge of sexual abuse of children .
but before the commission said that , in his opening statement to the committee , the association said that in his organization never tackled the case of sexual abuse of a child .
the executive director phillip hare was asked about the case when he was one of the employees of the ymca associations accused of offences relating to child pornography , and on the other , when the physical education instructor at the ymca caringbah from the association in 1991 , he was convicted of sexual harassment of children who were in their care .
mr. hare said gaili furnessové , adviser to the commission that he knew about the case , but not the second .
he admitted that the opening statement of the ymca was also inaccurate , as stated in the organisation of the ymca to carry out external audits , which praised the organization as a leading supporter of the rights of children .
the evidence submitted by the commission says that the ymca had been alerted to the fact that in the audit of the ministry of education and the company in august this year , the second lowest of the four possible ratings .
mr. hare , which began with the ymca associations to work when he was 21 , admitted that the leadership from him down failed when mr. lord has taken without assurances that the staff is aware of the obligation to notify the breach of the rules of the safety of the children .
earlier this year , lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys who had committed during the two years when he worked at the ymca .
he was jailed for at least six years .
mr. hare , however , rejected the assertion that the ymca had a cultural problem that prevented staff to report security breaches of children , mr lord .
members of staff provide evidence that they were witnessing such violations , including the fact that the lord was alone with the children , privately on them , letting them sit on his lap , he used to tell them that he likes , and he is playing with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwellová , who was a child of mrs. lord and asked for the training of the safety of children , because she was worried about his behaviour , testified that jacqui barnat , head of services for children in the ymca caringbah in the city , which was lordovým superiors , was &quot; very intimidating , and often it was difficult to talk to him about something . &quot;
director-general said that does not accept the evidence of staff that he felt uneasy if they had contacted their superiors and deeds to report .
instead , he said that their friendship with lord clouded their judgment , and therefore not report the problem .
mr. hare said that the board of the ymca associations in new south wales state its view that the lessons of &quot; the case of jonathan lord &quot; for the organisation lies in the fact that the staff &quot; did not file any report , &quot; and the council agreed with him .
mr. hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations emerged , made a general manager for services to children in the organisation of the ymca whitleym liam showed .
he said that the aim was to avoid distortion of the evidence , but it was &quot; over-zealous &quot; and poorly executed .
an expert on sexual abuse of children by professor stephen smallbone of griffithovy university told the commission that the ymca in new south wales was not between 2009 and 2011 , the organisations that would be safe for children .
he said that there were serious problems in recruitment , screening , training , training and management personnel .
the hearing was adjourned on december 20 .
the president of the union of entrepreneurs in the construction sector in the czech republic , václav matyáš : new green economies should continue
czech construction since 2008 , struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and indifference of the state to tackle the issue of investment construction .
the opening of the new green savings was a positive signal for our construction , especially for small and medium-sized companies in each region .
it is a great opportunity , not only for the citizens who , after the implementation of the measures will save considerable sums for heating , but also a chance for the construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials .
each invested a billion will bring the state more than 2700 newly created jobs .
from the point of view of the state &apos;s fiscal policies are significant leverage and the multiplier effects , it is also one of the most important growth measures .
the association of entrepreneurs in the construction sector in the czech republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government and calls for the implementation of such steps that would allow the continuation of the program , to be announced in the next challenge .
faa : air passengers on planes can now use technological gains ( but not to call from their mobile phones ) .
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices &quot; from gate to gate &quot; - in addition to calls from their mobile phones - for reading , playing games , watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated new rules on thursday , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) .
but passengers do not expect the changes occur immediately .
how quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to the individual airlines , faa administrator michael huerta said at a press conference .
the airlines will have to manage the faa to demonstrate the extent to which their aircraft are in line with the new rules , and that the updated training manual for cabin crew and guidelines for storing equipment to comply with the new rules .
the faa said it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
among the companies that have already submitted plans are delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the state of such a plan , we can improve the widespread use of electronic equipment , very quickly , &quot; the faa said in a statement .
at present , passengers are required to switch off their smart phones , tablets and other devices , as soon as the door closed aircraft .
they cannot be turned on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers , and the captain , issued the permit .
from passengers are expected to shut down their plants again when the plane is descending for landing , and nezapnou them until the plane is on the ground .
under the new rules , the airlines whose planes are properly protected against electronic interference , to allow its passengers to use their devices during take-off , landing and taxiing , the faa said .
since most of the new transport planes and other aircraft , which was modified so that passengers can use the stars at a higher altitude , is expected to meet these criteria .
laura gladingová , president of the association of professional stewards , welcomed the changes .
&quot; once the new rules will be introduced safely - and we don &apos;t , we will work closely with shipping companies - will be a success , &quot; she said in her statement gladingová .
we &apos;re tired of , frankly , that we look like &quot; guards . &quot;
however , surfing the internet and sending e-mails and sms or downloading will remain below the 3-kilometer altitude forbidden , the agency said .
passengers will be notified to their smart phones , tablets and other devices they switched to the air .
so , still no words with friends , the online game of scrabble , played by actor alec baldwin on his smart phone in 2011 , when he was , as is well known , fired from an aircraft company of american airlines , because he refused to turn off their equipment when the plane was parked at the gate .
and heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of fears that it could hurt someone if flying around the cabin .
calls from mobile phones will be on board will continue to be banned .
the rules for the use of mobile phones does not determine the faa , but the american federal committee for telecommunications .
the faa may in some electronic devices during takeoff and landing to lift the ban .
mark rosenker last month from the national committee for safety in transport , an expert on national security in the transport sector at cbs news , said that mobile phones will continue to consider the risk .
&quot; mobile phones are really a problem , not only because it could potentially create interference with the navigational instruments , but data from the fcc , we also know that in the air can cause interference transmitting towers , &quot; rosenker said .
oborový advisory committee created by the faa to examine this problem , last month suggested that the government allowed the wider use of electronic devices .
the faa has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
kritici , such as senator claire mccaskillová , a democrat from missouri , says that there is no valid security reasons for the ban .
restrictions are also increasingly difficult to put forward , because the use of such devices is ubiquitous .
some studies suggest that up to a third of the passengers forgets the obligation to turn off their devices or ignore it .
the faa began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the cancellation of navigation and communication equipment , when passengers began to carry the fm radio , technical achievement of the age .
new airlines are far more dependent on the aircraft &apos;s electrical systems than previous generations , but they are also designed and approved by the faa to be resistant to electronic interference .
the airlines have for several years , offered to passengers using wi-fi in travel altitudes .
the plans prepared for wi-fi systems are also less susceptible to interference .
the vast majority of the airlines would be under the new rules had to adjust for the increased use of electronic equipment , huertová said .
the current electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio broadcasting than it was at the facilities of previous generations .
for example , the electronic reader issued in turning the page only minimal broadcasts .
but the broadcast is stronger when they withdrew the device or send data .
among those who are pushing to relax restrictions on the use of these devices passengers , it is .
in 2011 , the company &apos;s deputy transport plane loaded with its kindle electronic readers and carried out a test flight , but no problem appeared .
the members of the advisory committee of the faa expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks .
douglas kidd from the national association of airline passengers , said he is convinced that the interference from these devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee , said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to promote the fact that such devices can cause interference air systems , and most of these reports is very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa allowed pilots to order passengers to shut down the device during the instrument flying at low visibility .
a group of travel industry welcomed the changes , and it is a sensible approach to the travelling public , which uses the technology in profusion .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in breach of security , &quot; said roger dow , the executive director of the american association of travel .
in an unprecedented admission , john kerry said that the american espionage &quot; went too far &quot;
john kerry suggested the us refining defensive posture on their monitoring programs and , in an unprecedented admission said that in some cases , espionage &quot; went too far . &quot;
the foreign minister also admitted that , together with barack obama is responsible for that , with regard to the incendiary revelations about the nsa spying activities that appeared thanks to the informant edward snowdenovi , acted as a &quot; autopilot . &quot;
the published information triggered a diplomatic storm between the u.s. government and its allies .
mr. kerry , via video-link to open government conference in london , said : &quot; there is no doubt that the president and i and others in the government have really learned about some of the things that the inertia of guns , because there was a possibility , with reference to the second world war , a difficult period of the cold war and then , of course , the 11th of september . &quot;
he became the first high-ranking member of the u.s. government , who admitted that the american espionage crossing the border , but stressed that it did not violate anyone &apos;s rights .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it has gone too far . &quot;
and the president is determined to try to explain to the people and to clarify and already carried out a thorough review to ensure that no one had the feeling that there has been an abuse .
i assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people .
mr. kerry , however , insisted that the nsa is seeking good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves . &quot;
in the world , there is a radical extremism , which is firmly determined to murder and fire people up and to challenge the government .
and what if you were able to detect and stop it before it happens ?
in fact , we avoid falling off the plane , they didn &apos;t buildings and were not executed people , because we can learn more about these plans forward .
the president senate subcommittee on european affairs on thursday said that us policy makers are going to europe to respond to concerns from abroad , which relate to alleged american espionage , and convince the europeans that we must continue to combine their forces in the fight against terrorism .
senator chris murphy of connecticut said that this week he spoke with members of the european parliament and other persons , and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in the anti-terrorist organizations because they are frustrated by the monitoring of the national security agency ( nsa ) .
for the national security interests of the united states , it is really important that europe remains with us in the same boat , with regard to the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism , said in an interview from washington , murphy , a member of the democratic party and president of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on european affairs .
and i &apos;m heading to europe , has made it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the nsa programs .
reports in the media that the nsa collected millions of telephone records in europe , disrupting relations with some american allies , although the head of the agency , said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that nato allies gathered and shared with the united states ,
other revelations cited documents revealed over snowdenem that the nsa has monitored the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel and other world leaders to 34 .
the director of national intelligence james clapper espionage allies defended as necessary and said that it is from both sides of the issue .
amid the tumult , murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary path that should take place this year , and hopes that will appear in the delegation members of both parties and chambers .
in the next few days to be published the names of the other legislators who intend to engage .
he said that the program is still working .
although murphy said that the aim of the trip is to help repair relations , adding that they will be ready , &quot; well-intentioned education measures . &quot;
he said that european leaders must be honest to their own people , in terms of the spy programs that use themselves for years .
&quot; while we adjust their monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones spying here , &quot; murphy said .
in the meantime , mr. kerry is going according to plan this weekend in the middle east and to poland to respond to the hostility , has already resulted in the american strategy in syria , egypt and iran , as well as the american surveillance activities .
the words &quot; mugabe is limping donkey &quot; was already in prison , the court annulled the law
until now , the people of zimbabwe have had to pay close attention to how people talk about devětaosmdesátiletém mugabe , who has ruled the country since the early 1980s , since the end of 1987 , standing in her forehead .
according to section 33 of the criminal law , to denigrate the presidency threatened to a fine of $ 100 to one year imprisonment .
&quot; prosecutors should not keen to blame the people on the president in pubs or other public places , &quot; said representatives of the constitutional court .
the nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines the freedom of expression .
it is likely that the government appeals against the decision of the court , informed the british bbc .
against the law to restrict the number of damaged zimbabweans loudly , among them tendai danga , police arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a fight with a policeman in the bar .
in may , ended up in jail , an opposition activist swapped in public mugabe a &quot; limping donkey . &quot;
in august , after the prosecutor accused the 26-year-old man because of his plans to use the poster with the faces of robert mugabe as toilet paper .
the court also declared unconstitutional a law restricting the freedom of the media .
&quot; the state cannot punish people whose statement later turn out to be false , &quot; said deputy minister of justice malala luke .
until now , the zimbabwean law allowed for a person who publish false information , was sentenced to 20 years in prison .
&quot; the existence of a law to criminalise someone for a false declaration has a chilling effect on the right to express themselves freely , &quot; malala said .
despite the fact that mugabe has ruled the country hard hands for more than 33 years , adopted in march , zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum on a new constitution with wider civil liberties .
tiny steps away from the dictatorship of one man in the country came in 2009 , when the agreement between mugabe and the opposition has brought to the prime minister morgan tsvangiraje .
however , the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 , the highest inflation in the world , which exceeded 100,000 percent .
in 2009 , the government is completely abolish the national currency .
today , in zimbabwe is only the currencies of other countries .
zbídačené economy are from mugabe &apos;s imprudent agricultural reform .
in 2000 , white farmers has reconstituted the land between his supporters and war veterans .
most of them , however , with the operation of the farms had no experience .

the rescue package worth $ 325 million dollars for tasmánské health
the federal government insists that a rescue package worth $ 325 million dollars for the moribund health in tasmania contained tough conditions to ensure that the state government nepromrhá funds .
federal minister for health tanya pliberseková announced that an australian union is &quot; urgent measures &quot; to avert the crisis caused by an ageing population of the island , a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic problems .
funding for a period of four years , was decided after government consultations with tasmanian independent mp andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has come up with an emergency rescue package , which we believe will solve specific problems facing the state , &quot; said mrs pliberseková today .
the package of 325 million dollars contains 31 million dollars for the operation at the request of the patient .
another 2,600 operations , including orthopaedic surgery and cataract operations will help eliminate debt .
money is also freely accessible to the clinic in hobart and launcestonu , better postoperative care , training health specialists , mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments are responding to the idea that the leading clinicians have told me that the best way to help tasmánskému healthcare system , &quot; said mrs pliberseková .
the minister stressed that the government tasmánská must require a strict regime of reporting and accounting obligations .
the state will have to maintain the current level of funding for the commonwealth has received the money , and to inform a month , where additional funds were spent .
there would be a three-man committee which will ensure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible .
mr wilkie said today that 325 million dollars will be useless , &quot; until it is followed by a real reform in order to put a more sustainable basis tasmánského public health system . &quot;
still , praised the government &apos;s response to his request for an urgent assistance , which rose for the first time in dealing with the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i believe that the federal aid package will be able to pull the state of public health in a critical condition , &quot; said mr wilkie .
according to the state governments of these additional selected procedures significantly reverse the recent cuts .
the federal opposition health spokesman peter dutton believes that today &apos;s statement is a &quot; patches . &quot;

from the villa moved to the suburbs .
ivan grew up and spent most of his life in the apartment house with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful vilových neighborhoods on in prague .
the original owners of the house , but it gained in restitution and tenants had to move with little severance pay .
ivan so quickly to find alternative housing for himself and his elderly mother by then .
from the known got a tip on a flat 3 + kk in older panelovém domě on the opposite side of the prague .
&quot; at first it was a shock , but the view from the fourth floor of a large dam and a forest park thrills me on the other side , &quot; says ivan on first impression .
at first i thought it would be a stopgap for three years .
&quot; today we live here more than 13 years , and not just because of the gradual reconstruction would not change it , &quot; she adds .
the mother and daughter had migrated from stodvacetimetrového apartment into a smaller flat 62 m2 and almost all the equipment to dish out .
the action was not easy , things were stored with friends and the gradual arranging lasted almost a year .
the new apartment was in pretty good shape , but to pass the necessary adjustments , such as painting doors or exchange of windows .
předešlý blasted away at the core of the owner , but the owner of the most inconvenient and unnecessary or in a large hall and a small bathroom .
by combining two rooms , a multifunctional living space .
the architects used for the demarcation of the zones and the layout of the room drywall , which has enabled the new location of lights .
the first intervention , which , after a few years she was the rungs in the living room .
this apartment had changed the layout of the 2 + kk , but the room has received the airiness and opened with a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery .
the next step was to improve the standard of pvc floors for the formica .
in the bathroom , ivan didn &apos;t know .
for years , i drew the magazines on housing and looking for inspiration .
in one of them , i recently discovered an interesting implementation .
so i called on the recommendation of the young architektku kamilu douděrovou .
&quot; it was really the most important step in the future , &quot; says ivan .
thanks to the rebuilding of the bathroom managed at the same time to adjust and the availability of the hall .
architektka joined the space toilet and bathroom and two doors with otvíravými wings replaced one sliding , thus save the place .
the bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently accessible .
quality tiles imitate sandstone , in the shower is an extra seat in the toilet bidetová shower .
the successful cooperation with kamilou douděrovou continued .
in the context of the show how to build a dream was quick , but the fundamental change in the living room , which was also the architect martin Čeněk .
the area , which was created by combining two smaller rooms , we had to get three functions , dining , living and sleeping without helping the traditional principles of optical division , for example , or japanese polopříčkami walls .
&quot; this would result in a breach of openness and uniformity of the space , &quot; explains the architect .
originally managed to separate sleeping and living part .
it was enough to turn his back two sofas and between them to build a custom-made box on the blanket .
the breakfast nook define the shades of floors and painting .
on the floor in the kitchen and the dining nook of using an architect quality marmoleum , sliding doors has revived the wallpaper pattern .
kuchyňský kout , if necessary , conceal sliding panels with the wallpaper .
the new floor of antialergického marmolea has many advantages over the previous of fibreglass : the softer nekluzký surface seamless and better sound insulation .
the niches and ceilings of the plasterboard highlighted color is an example of how we can work with the space in the suburbs .
colors i left on architektech , i wished it to be joyful .
&quot; i like orange , the same shade i had in the previous quarters , &quot; says ivan .
themed obklad from grafoskla blooming magnolias is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element .
to warm their energetic tone architects chose the white , which underscored the modern functional style .
in a small apartment managed to save the books , among other things , in the space below the window sills .
everything is within reach , the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance .
in contrast to the new předělaném interior works well with older , for example , with the decades-old crystal chandelier , with high-quality art objects that ivan collects all his life .
the last came in a series of the kitchen .
the cabinets were previously deployed on both sides and the owner had seemed a bit like here in the tunnel .
architektka lighten up their numbers and přeskládala deployment .
the furniture in a simple design is made to order , but slightly pearly white surface .
in a small space fit nápaditému thanks to the washing machine , dryer and dishwasher .
the appearance of a small kitchen revived celoskleněný lining the walls above the plate .
unique grafosklo with digitally printed motive is attractive , moreover , is well maintained .
ivan chose magnolií flowers that remind her favorite neighborhood , where she lived for years .
now it seems that he is happy here .
in the original bathroom was a small tub and sink into the new owner has opted for a neutral shade mural .
a large shower stall has a glass door ronal .
the task was to create a simple space from the environment in which the functions and equipment will be in harmony .
the interior of our bodies and color to unite and try for his elegant , comfortable , not too crowded appearance .
&quot; another condition was a barrier-free solution with the minimum of obstacles and opportunities for easy movement around the furniture and the availability of everyday objects , &quot; adds kamila douděrová .
the minister holcát restored the main sisters for the czech republic
head nurse for the czech republic should represent the interests of the nurses , who number more than 100,000 in the czech republic .
&quot; i think it is essential that this feature has been clearly defined and formalised to nurse its representative in the structure of the office - representative to which they can always turn if necessary , &quot; said martin holcát , minister of health .

&quot; i meet with a number of problems that have occurred in the exercise of the profession of nurses , i see these difficulties and i intend to contribute to their solution . &quot;

other areas covered intends to focus include improving working conditions , seeking ways to better mutual cooperation in the team and with the managements of the providers of health services , skills and employment issues , such as respect for the labour code or nepřetěžování sisters , their lack of numbers in that time and place .
we often hear anonymous complaints , but out of fear of possible sanction is not documented on the specific case where there could be a violation of the rules .
&quot; where there is no prosecutor , not a judge , and so would the main sisters of the czech republic in this case could serve as a guarantee of anonymity such complaints and the specific case to the competent authorities to check , &quot; concludes alena Šmídová .

jana péťová : a step back .
so i decided to take a step back , but when i think about it , it is not really a step , but a big jump - jump a few years back , and into the memories of my childhood .
it is the memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash dishes , vacuum and do his homework .
although these &quot; obligations , &quot; it was mostly just a theory , the parents &apos; wishes .
the practice was completely different - run from school , drop the bag in the corner and run out .
playing with other children , ball games , some video games .
then in the series , helen and her boys to embroider řetízkovým stitch a festive tablecloth for grandma &apos;s birthday .
and then finally , after subsequent warnings to wash the dishes , vacuum , fetching wood in the winter in earthenware stoves and tasks to do after dark under the lamp ( or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write love poetry to the high school sweethearts ) .
in the morning , go to breakfast homemade strawberry jam ( real fruit , not one of those jams that are sold now , the content of which was beside the strawberries ) , a tea of dried herbs , which we were so pleased with my mom .
also , i remember those enchanted evenings , when there was dead silence in the room when we played the sister of songs from the radio on the tapes , which were loudly in the old ghetto blaster set for my mom .
and then we went to the pencil přetáčely tapes and let himself over and over one of the same song , our favorite and a připíjely trap .
or we have across the desk phone early for using cans , which were tied together with string - and while we &apos;re on the phone to hear better , it was necessary to thoroughly clean ears , then uchošťour was the match + wadding .
the minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now , and my parents were able to live in it so that nothing was missing .
we have no nepotřebovaly those iphones , ipady or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes .
clothing has been handed down from generation to generation , and the best &quot; addition &quot; to the wardrobe was a tie-dyed t-shirt domestic production for using the sava .
from the electronics took us to the satisfaction of the mother &apos;s walkman tape player and the maximum so that we have shared with his sister , who , by the way , we were just on a train on a school tour .
we thought it was more interesting to play with aunt kloboučku hop or backgammon or , as i have said , &quot; just &quot; go out .
when i was a little older than we got under the tree videopřehrávač , surely his parents were saving for a long time , but unfortunately we long for a few days .
my younger sister in the narwhal strudel , supposedly so beautifully papal tapes , so she tried if spapá and strudel .
unfortunately , spapal , but it was his last bite .
well , and this incident is still poor , still on a plate from my dad .
he says that when she was little , narwhal pie in the video and thought that it plays a recipe and played , so it still doesn &apos;t know how to bake .
i remember how we can all communicate , communicate with a cell phone , computer .
together with my sister , we were on vacation with your grandmother who agreed with the granddaughter neighbor , when we meet again next year in the summer with the grandmothers - and so it was , so it was true .
we sešly .
promise now with someone that you will see in a year ? !
i remember the winter , too , when we were running out with the whole village , built snowmen , rode on the snowy hill near the church on bags filled with straw .
then we dined together with the family and talked about the previous day .
of course , we were told before each dinner with my sister &apos;s notorious phrase : &quot; go wash your hands ! &quot;
yes , it is true today , but definitely not in the bathroom to tap přivázáné soap in the net from lemons .
after dinner , when my dad was working in the garage , &quot; &quot; in the beer with jardou from the village , we were on the floor with his mom , his feet propped on the tiled oven , opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackle of wood that came from the stove .
we were closer - really - we counted how many of our friends on the social network , we knew how much we have friends , the real !
we komunikovali together - we talked - we wrote daily messages across the various hut , smsky .
there was nothing of the sort , and yet we know a lot more about themselves .
and so i could go on for a long time .
it &apos;s nice to remember , especially if these memories fill up by looking at the albums , where they are neatly put up black horns caused by black-and-white photos .
and if i didn &apos;t know how old i was , from behind the photos is always written in the year of the picture .
i look that , although we didn &apos;t really suit haircuts , according to the pot , and we should trousers after poking two sizes larger , no one will laugh at us before , it was so normal ( not in ) .
and i prefer to go back to that step forward - into reality .
by 2013 , and i will wait to see what the modern period up to be one of my children .
what i do know is that these are my memories are now for a young teenage generation , so at least somewhere , &quot; a century for the monkeys , &quot; and i think a lot is that this &quot; předopičí &quot; while also own lifetime .
i wanted it to them !
spořit must know the young czechs .
most of them , but they don &apos;t even know what interest
more and more of the czechs gives the money aside .
still , but do not reach the champions in savings in the region .
for most of the money set aside by the austrians , who save a month on average , 181 euros .
a little more than the czechs save and the people in slovakia .
it is clear from the survey , erste savings monitored by barometr in the countries of central and eastern europe .
it also turned out that the mood of savers is improving and two-thirds of respondents are planning to give away more money .
while the czechs are roughly in the middle of the savers , romania and serbia people savings products are still very little .
for example , nearly every other serbian could save at home , according to the survey , &quot; under the pillow . &quot;
in germany has risen this year , the number of those who have been saving a higher amount per month .
last year , each month on various types of savings deferring thousands of up to 2.5 thousand crowns 26 percent of respondents , this year it is about five percent more .
the average monthly deposit year-on-year but dropped slightly to 2078 crowns .
the biggest hit with savings products is a supplementary pension .
it favours 54 percent of czechs , while three years ago , it was the most popular way to evaluate the savings for only 36 percent of the people .
on the contrary , the declining popularity of building savings , compared to last year , also fell significantly interested in investment funds .
you already uses only 16 percent of respondents , while last year it was almost a quarter of the people .
the survey also showed that although people are considered important to save money , most of them don &apos;t know what the proceeds on individual products are .
first of all , young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is extended .
on the other hand , the best awareness of the profitability of their stored money is the oldest group of respondents , among people over 50 years knows that 73 percent of respondents .
in an international comparison of the erste czechs lead in the use of online banking , which regularly uses the 44 percent of the people .
následují is the slovaks and austrians with 12procentním distance .
australian &apos;s appeal against the stay in the thai prison
jednadvacetiletá woman from sydney , who was sentenced to patnáctidennímu prison on the island of phuket , when falsely claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver , had appealed against the verdict and was released on bail .

however , the record of the industrial television later revealed that after he broke up with my australian friend , returned safely to their hotel .
police from the island of phuket has held talks with bamfordovou two days before he confessed that he invented the story .
before the judicial process has been kept in the local police cell .
bamfordová was sentenced to 15 days in jail in a detention facility with low-security on the periphery in phuket , instead was placed in jail for adult women .
she is the daughter of the former australian fa player peter tunkse , which , in the case of his daughter asked for help from the ministry of foreign affairs in canberra .
tunks sydneyskému told the sunday telegraph that the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in australia .
&quot; it is a evidentně difficult period , but we hope that our safe return as soon as possible , &quot; tunks said .
bamfordová appealed against the ruling and was released on bail of 50,000 baht .
reports from australia states that , in the meantime , she spent her vacation in the resort of krabi in southern thailand .
legal sources in thailand says bamfordovou was represented by a local lawyer in phuket , but she said she received a warning that the appeal can lead to legal action , which will increase its punishment and will result in a location to a prison for adults .
however , after the recent assassination of an australian travel agency employee michelle smith in phuket , thailand may try to repair the battered image for tourists , which just might be worth liberating verdict .

báňský magnate , who leads a dispute over payment of the tax base of coal with a value of $ 6 million , the statement said , when he jettisoned the question of whether there is a conflict of interest .
palmer &apos;s united party can handle up to four votes in the senate , which play a vital role in deciding whether to levy a tax on coal and mining activities .
but mr. palmer said that the conflict of interest may be only ministers , and added that abbott &apos;s daughters were in a position where they could have a personal benefit from the policy .
&quot; he got into a conflict of interest in relation to the paid parental leave , because if any of his daughters became pregnant , he should have a direct interest in whether it would get parental leave , &quot; said mr. palmer .
two months after the election , the electoral commission for the conversion of the votes officially declared by mr palmer as the winner in the battle for a seat on the fairfax county in the sunshine coast , gaining 53 votes .
mr. palmer called for a review of the election results , in order to speed up the process .
tony abbott &apos;s daughters frances and bridget .
it should decide on these elections two months after the closure of the polling stations ?
&quot; we need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
why can &apos;t we have a system where you can come and do the details to the computer , immediately to vote and have the results at 6 : 30 in the evening ?
mr. palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots .
the point is that the results can be repressed , if someone does not like ?
in those days , and at this time it appears the use of pencils unbelievable .
electoral commission studying the possibility of an electronic vote and , along with new zealand recently issued a joint contribution to the debate .
mr. palmer ( 59 ) , said that his political program extends to the airport in the sunshine coast and that his new job was taking &quot; very seriously . &quot;
public office is a service to the public .
&quot; neusilujeme for no reward except the one that we can serve the company at this critical time , &quot; he said .
the new civil code is preparing six out of ten firms
the approaching the effectiveness of the new civil code and the law on commercial corporations from 1 january 2014 , intensively preparing six out of ten firms .
only eight percent of the companies surveyed reported that matters related to the two key codes in their company tackled at all .
it is clear from the survey firms doing deloitte legal , which examined the views of 108 czech companies .
in relation to the effectiveness of the two key codes now at the last minute , many managers are beginning to realize they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies .
the biggest change in private law over the past 50 years , in our opinion , affect all citizens and companies in the czech republic .
because of the manoeuvre politicians lived long business sector in uncertainty , if it comes to the revolutionary changes in the end or not .
&quot; now , there are only a few weeks to make the transition to a new law passed for their businesses without complications , &quot; commented on the results of a deloitte partner doing legal jan spáčil .
of the 61 percent of companies engaged in intensive new codes , 26 percent said that their companies would take all the necessary measures to be ready in time .
in addition , 35 percent of companies from this number is going to take the necessary measures in the near future .
against this , every fifth firm has not yet rekodifikacemi , yet has a clear idea of how to prepare for them .
a total of 11 percent had no opinion and will be able to assess the issue .
only eight percent of the company admits that matters related to rekodifikacemi has not been addressed .
the most important legal issue related to the new civil code is for the largest number of respondents by signing new contracts ( 21 percent ) , followed by addressing the terms of trade ( 16 percent ) and further changes in the real estate registry and liability ( 10 percent ) .
for contracts will be one of the most important news of the entire rekodifikace and unification of the adjustments to the treaties only within the framework of a new civil code .
the current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial code goes , with the result that the contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs .
&quot; in the case of the new legislation will offer many innovations , with an emphasis on greater freedom to organize relationships , &quot; said a lawyer doing deloitte legal lukáš poddaný .
in the context of the law on commercial corporations , regarded as the most important issue for nearly a quarter of the companies , the issue of increasing the accountability of the statutory bodies .
also follow the issues related to changes in the convening of the meeting and ( 15 percent ) and the representation of the company ( 14 percent ) .
the new legislation is to tighten the obligations and the possible implications for statutory bodies , particularly at a time when the company is in danger of bankruptcy or to get into it .
&quot; in practice , this means that if members of the board of directors and managers of companies will not act with due commercial care and avert the imminent collapse of the company may lose the benefit for the performance in the last two years , &quot; said spáčil .
revelations of the nsa increases social paranoia monitoring by the state
one peaceful day at the end of august , the german police helicopter buzzed over an american consular office in frankfurt , capital of the german economy .
at the direction of the federal office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , was the purpose of the mission to take photographs of the roof of the american outposts , which is located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
the german media claims that the bfv had hoped to be able to identify the presence of spy antennas , and launched the action in berlin exchange of views between the american and german foreign minister .
james clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence , in september , again insisted that the united states used its foreign intelligence capabilities , &quot; stealing trade secrets to foreign companies in favour of american companies and enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits . &quot;
but since edward snowden , who is from the co-worker became an informer , he began to reveal their valuable collection from the secret monitoring of the united states , european governments and business leaders that they do not know if they have the words of the director of the trust .
after reports that the us national security agency to conduct espionage in the brazilian oil company and gain access to data , with whom they have american cloudoví providers , including google and yahoo , have reached the general paranoia about the monitoring of new dimensions .
the last straw came with the revelation that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone may have been bugged ten years .
if it can be subjected to the most powerful person in europe , then they are certainly a potential target and business leaders .
snowden zprůhlednil intensive cooperation between u.s. intelligence agencies and companies .
i would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany must wake up , &quot; said oliver grün , president of bitmi , which represents small and medium-sized it company in germany .
according to a survey issued in july consultancy service ey german companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and theft of data , the us now represents as much risk as china .
in the documents revealed mr snowdenem , however , so far there is no evidence that the united states transmit the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu lacks certain skills in the field of it and the internet , and said that should seek to reduce its dependence on the us :
business leaders are sceptical to it .
of the german parliament , there are voices that we should make the german google .
i just , i can close my eyes and slowly open them again .
this is not the way to go , says that plattner , chairman of the german software company sap .
if someone wanted a strong european it industry , not to let him 20 years ago to die .
everything in germany shall rise from coal to cars and farmers .
everything in addition to the it industry .
the scope and the technical maturity of american spy agencies detected snowdenem is for some companies who have believed that the biggest threat from the monitoring is china , still shocking .
it is a big turnaround in cloudové computing , where european leaders on a wider scale realised that the data stored in the us fall under its jurisdiction and are therefore potentially irrelevant .
according to a survey by the business community of cloud security alliance around 10 percent of the non-members after the discovery of the us prism programme to cancel plans to use data mining cloudového provider based in the us .
jim snabe , one of the ceos sap , says : &quot; we have a new question for customers who have been here a year ago - where are my data stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction will remain physically ? &quot;
many german senior officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets , and this data must be protected at all costs .
that is the economic espionage , it is not surprising .
it is always happening .
&quot; it is a major issue for many years , and it has changed significantly , even during the current debate , &quot; says kurt bock , director-general agrochemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level , just as we are spying on them , because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses .
podnikoví manager is generally very unwilling to boast protiopatřeními , which made it to the attacker did not provide any advantage .
in the case of large companies have long been recalls that take in the free memory usb disk or leave them unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise .
ulrich hackenberg , a member of the board of directors of automakers audi , says that for many years , it is common practice to collect before the meeting of the board of directors of mobile phones , so they could not be used as a listening device .
the german office of the bfv directors advised to consider whether or not to use on foreign trips , simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk of smart phones can be embezzled .
prepaid mobile phones are then fired .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market .
&quot; small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets to neautorizovanému approach , &quot; warns bfv in his report .
the us has its own company warns against economic espionage by other countries .
according to the washington post documents of the us national intelligence estimate stated in february by france , russia and israel in the second row of the criminals who engage in hacking activities for the economic newsletter , just behind china .
a member of the council of the german risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bernard squarcini , the former head of the french domestic intelligence agency dcri , this month in one of the conversations said : &quot; services fully know that all countries , even if they work together in the fight against terrorism , spying on its allies . &quot;
the new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking
scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine , which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse for life in front of nicotine addiction .
before tests on humans is the need to carry out further tests , which would take several years , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical school in new york , says that the first signs are good .
&quot; we certainly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today , but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches to overcome , &quot; said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the creation of antinikotinových antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then begin to create a continuous stream of these antibodies .
the antibodies are pursuing all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain , which prevent a smoker &apos;s nicotine intervention .
in tests of vaccinated mice , which was subsequently delivered nicotine , continue their normal activities .
but the mice that were not vaccinated , &quot; settled down , &quot; said the researchers , which is a sign that the nicotine they got into the brain .
the experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccines have failed because it contained antibodies .
the injections would be administered so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies , which have proved expensive and impractical .
the cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because the liver cells are converted to a factory for the production of antibodies .
professor crystal said that if a future vaccine for humans will be completely safe , they could bring their children before they have the taste of a cigarette to try and prevent that nicotine addiction .
however , it would be much more likely to use smokers to quit .
&quot; they know that if they start smoking again , because of the nicotine vaccine will have no benefit from it , and that will help them get rid of the bad habit , &quot; he said .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but pointed out that there is a need for further research .
a desperate cry of obama &apos;s voters
i voted for obama twice - i shared the hope for a possible change
he said that obama &apos;s sincere efforts to derail the republican obstruction
obstrukční policy cannot justify the woes of websites of obama &apos;s health care or attacks by unmanned aircraft
memoáry obama &apos;s campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have happened
nathaniel p. morris , the second year studying medicine at harvard .
in those days , i read a very sad book .
about this book , i thought me during the grim days of my second year at the medical school will encourage and restore a modicum of hope in me .
it &apos;s called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( troufalost to victory ) and it is the memories of barack obama &apos;s presidential campaign in 2008 .
when i finish the evening reports of patients and i &apos;m going to bed , book me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches you were breathtaking .
the elections ended in overwhelming and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents were saving newspapers that they got .
the white house headed a team of young visionaries and the nation was ready for a change .
during the inauguration in 2008 , obama had the support of 82 percent .
and here the book closing .
go to the present is a harsh awakening , like waking up from a dream .
it is hard to remember these optimistic days - seem distant memories , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years after i threw his first electoral ticket , there has been a change .
it was certainly nothing of what i imagined .
i acknowledge that obama has achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the affordable care over the withdrawal of our troops from iraq and an end to the policy of &quot; not to ask questions , to say nothing &quot; after the killing of osama bin laden .
moreover , i believe that the partisan obstruction reverse so many efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , among other things , the ability of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in guantánámu .
but after many situations where i am in front of colleagues and friends defended the obama administration , i am in terms of explanations that can provide , came to the absolute limit .
i ocitl in the place of political desperation .
obstruction for republican spain cannot explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders , even with raids of drones that kill innocent children overseas .
they cannot be explained by the fact that the national security agency collects data on the private lives of americans , or that haunts those who discover improper behaviour of the government .
it cannot be held responsible for the execution of anwar al-awlakího , an american citizen , without a proper court for the reduction of public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign .
cannot be justified by the findings of the report , which says that the white house &apos;s efforts to silence the media are &quot; the most aggressive ... from the nixon administration . &quot;
and , most recently , nor can apologise to the inability to create more than three years after the signing of the affordable care simple web pages .
i don &apos;t know whether something like this .
whether i was in 18 years , suggested that the government &apos;s power may be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it .
volená function apparently does not have a predictable course and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party , and the random events , such as the massacre in newton .
however , all of the examples that i mentioned above , to a large extent , appear to be the result of his own administration &apos;s decision .
and that worries me the most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was thrilled with his candidacy .
mitt romney was confused and nevybroušenou alternative and seemed unable to consolidate its policy or position .
i had the feeling that a second term for obama , freed from the pressure of the next election , filled with the hope that we once heard .
still , it is a return to 2008 - with the support for obama this week dropped below 45 % - through this book increasingly difficult .
it makes me remember that a number of promises that were lost .
this week , i read a chapter in the book about how obama during the primaries in pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with clinton .
for additional meeting during the campaign , he told his staff that he must get back into the groove and remain faithful to their mission .
&quot; i want to get back our magic , &quot; he said .
we must not forget that who we are .
five years ago , mr. president , and i agree with you entirely .
the ideas expressed in this commentary are solely those of nathaniel morris .

syria destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons , says the supervisory authority
syria destroyed vital equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas , said on thursday , the committee for the global oversight of chemical weapons , while violent clashes broke out in the north of the country , near one of the places where they are expected to put toxic substances .
on thursday , the syrian more activist group , said that since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago killed more than 120,000 people .
the announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons came the day before 1 november .
the deadline , which the organization based in the hague has established damascus for the destruction or blocking traffic all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons and the machinery for mixing chemicals in order to create a poison gas and filling munitions .
completion of this , in principle , the initial phase of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable , which aims to be destroyed by mid-2014 all chemical weapons to damascus .
the destruction of the equipment means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies .
it is expected that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when the fighting raged on thursday in the town of safira , which experts described as the headquarters of the factory for the production of chemical weapons and storage sites , said the syrian observation room for human rights , based in britain .

since then , the number has not been updated .
the conflict has forced about 2 million people to leave the country .
assad &apos;s forces fought in safiře against the rebels , many of whom are associated with al-qaeda , for weeks .
pozorovatelna on thursday said that the losses were on both sides , but did not have specific figures .
the fighting underlined the dangers faced by inspectors for chemical weapons , who are in their mission , when they are in the middle of the ongoing civil war in syria to get rid of the chemical arsenal , must deal with tight deadlines .
in a statement from the office of the opcw , which closely cooperates with the united nations , was told that his team is now a &quot; satisfied that the check - and watched the destruction - syria &apos;s declared major equipment for the production and mixing / filling . &quot;
he added that &quot; there are currently no further control activities . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspectors said they have completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared damascus .
the inspectors said that because of safety concerns were unable to visit two places .
on thursday , the office of the opcw said that these two places in syria has been &quot; abandoned and ... the items of chemical weapons , which included , have been moved to two other declared places that have been inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the device in safiře was one of those places that the opcw inspectors could visit .
syria agreed on a plan to complete the destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the executive committee of the opcw next month .
&quot; klaním , courage and bravery , which you have shown in the fulfilment of this most demanding missions , the organization has ever had , &quot; said ahmet uzumcu , director of observers in a commentary issued by the office of the opcw .

he said that the cause of the explosion was not known .
alexei miller of gazprom says that the gas pipeline in bulgaria is launching a new era
the construction of the south stream gas pipeline in bulgaria is the start of one of the largest european energy projects , said the director of gazprom .
&quot; today , we are witnessing a milestone : she began construction on the bulgarian section of the south stream pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , &quot; said gazprom president alexei miller said in his statement .
this project is a key element of the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of russian exports to europe .
contractual dispute between gazprom and its partners in ukraine , which brings the majority of russian gas to europe , adds to the risk of conventional routes , officials say .
miller says that direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are &quot; forever &quot; removed .
when the whole project will start its operation in 2015 , the bulgarian consumers receive gas from the south stream pipeline at a reduced rate .
the company gazprom says that it has in other countries in the direction of flow to begin by the end of this year .
gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
early puberty : developed earlier
research has shown that afroameričanky and hispánky reaching puberty earlier than their caucasian contours .
the physical changes do not mean that approaching puberty
there is no evidence that they are hormones or other chemicals
experts say that one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity .
the trend earlier puberty is not so evident for boys .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children &apos;s health and family problems .
should the mother zděsit , when her daughter will grow breasts and pubic hair in the groin at 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of paediatricians this week in orlando , florida explained the pediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz that these physical changes are relatively common among american girls and represent a new standard .
&quot; i spent a lot of time by my parents said that it is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full of puberty , &quot; kaplowitz said .
visible signs of development , such as the growth of the chest hair at the groin and armpits and body odor , the girls appear earlier .
for the last forty years , however , was only a small shift in the age of the first period .
in the united states is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12,75 years in 1970 .
&quot; when they start to develop breasts typically takes at least two to three years before the first period , &quot; said kaplowitz , who is also the author of &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem &quot; ( early puberty in girls : the essential guide to tackle this growing problem . )
nejspolehlivějším test of how puberty will continue , it is time .
diskutuje is about what activates the real beginning of puberty , but if the growth of breast accompanied by growth spurtem before 8 years of age , the girl is considered a &quot; mature &quot; prematurely .
in most cases , the process slows down or stops - which may paediatric doctors closely monitored .
faster growth may be a reason for it to carry out tests endocrinologist in order to avoid the serious problems , such as a tumor or cyst .
there are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences : premature ageing bones , which can ultimately lead to stop the growth and zakrslosti in adulthood .
recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatments are dependent on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .
are also important psychosociologické aspects .
regarding the use of drugs , kaplowitz is cautious , but acknowledges that &quot; the suppression of puberty can mitigate the problems with the behaviour of the girl and her feelings that are different from their peers . &quot;
pochopitelný is another big problem : parents simply do not want to see their very young daughters were menstruation .
&quot; they do worry that it may become pregnant , or how it will handle the hygiene , &quot; kaplowitz said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; says one woman , whose daughter began to have menstrual period in 10 years .
although there were indications and we talked about menstruation , she wasn &apos;t prepared emotionally .
she came home from school scared and angry that it is the first of his friends .
there are a lot of well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty .
however , there is still a coherent set of evidence that they are to blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
the boys - like the girls - are reaching puberty earlier .
kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is an epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 , he helped to carry out the study on the girls , ranging in age from 6 to 9 years old , which connects the body fat with the timing of puberty .
other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country have afroameričanky and hispánky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .
explanations are different .
from a global perspective , it seems that the patterns of early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions over the climate to the genes .
another puzzle : although the boys are already at a young age appears on the face and in the groin , the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls .
other doctors participating in the conference of the american association of paediatricians ( aap ) added to this issue further complexity .
acne and pubic hair pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers .
&quot; we have to be careful in terms of how we identify the real onset of puberty , &quot; said lawrence silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist from goryebské children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to obtain from their pediatrician &apos;s instructions on how to talk to your child .
&quot; it may mean the need to talk with the child sooner than you expected , &quot; kaplowitz said .
if you stay calm , your child is likely to respond well .
the girls who are moving earlier , they need reassurance that even though it is early , this process is a normal part of life .
hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to syria .
there is a decisive battle .
the lebanese movement hezbollah deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountain area kalamún .
according to reports , israel still advanced in the wednesday raids at two sites in western syria destroyed the missiles to hezbollah .
the lebanese shiite organization is fighting in syria on the side of the army .
its program is also fighting against israel , who was not involved in the syrian conflict , but made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weaponry to the hands of hezbollah in lebanon .
reports on wednesday of israeli air raids on arms caches in western syria is yet to clarify .
israel made no comment on the attack , but he confirmed the american resources .
according to the syrian website dampress.com hit by rockets fired from the mediterranean syrian missile base snúbar džabla south of latákíje .
the news station al-arrabiyeh claims that were hit by two warehouses where the missiles were ready to transfer to lebanon .
according to its sources , it was a russian-made sa-8 missiles .
israel refused to comment on the report , but military analyst ron ben yishai said that syria is continuously trying to supply hezbollah with rockets and the syrian air force teaches members of the armed hezbollah with rockets .
sa-8 are obsolete missiles to the syrian army since the 1980s .
they are placed on a moving chassis .
although they are fairly primitive , thanks to mobility and small size , it is possible , it is easy to hide .
they are equipped with radar , but after firing missiles off , so it is hard to focus .
latákíja lies in western syria , in an area inhabited by the ruling alávity .
it is a well-guarded area and hezbollah has in the past been involved in the fighting in western syria .
he says that helps to protect the syrian shiite community , which alávité belongs .
now it is alleged to have 15,000 of its fighters ready to help conquer the army back kalamún .
along with hezbollah strengthens its troops there , as well as the syrian army .
kalamún lies between damascus and the third largest city in the country homsem .
the battle has been based on the resources of al-arabíji in retaliation for the recent attack on the headquarters of the opposition syrian shia brigade fadla abu abbas in the shiite parts of damascus .
hezbollah has helped the syrian army this year to win back the city kusajr near the lebanese border .
many of the insurgents from kusajru left just to kalamúnu .
he says that maliki has a large share of the reconstruction of the sectarian violence in iraq , which is said to be part of the fighting in neighboring syria .
the Čssd negotiates sobotka .
social democracy is crumbling , and the pp and babišovci talking about a common procedure .
if the social democrats in a few weeks of the moment , moving to the negotiating table with a perfectly sehranými partners who will put on the table a list of demands , including ministerial posts .
the envoys Čssd coalition then either swallow sour grapes , or rubber-stamped by the capricious minority government .
bohuslav sobotka after four days when he was carrying on a wave of sympathy for the first time .
yesterday , he failed to dominate the political consideration and compel convicted liar to resign .
meanwhile , potvrzeným negotiator for the party is the only one , the other members of the team will leave until after a crucial meeting of the central executive committee ( dvv ) .
i apologised to the members of the panel and now the citizens .
does not lie in your personal life , or to the public .
&quot; it was a mistake , &quot; he said after a meeting of the inner leadership of social democracy michal village .
he added that the post of first vice-chairman doesn &apos;t have .
&quot; i &apos;ll give its decision on november 10 dvv , &quot; said village .
similarly , he and vice-president Čssd zdeněk Škromach and the head of the group of jerome tejc .
he warned , however , that he was elected just two days ago .
the two mps then declared that they will do everything to ensure that a 50-strong club Čssd was one voice .
absurdnímu theatre notched crown michal hašek sentence : &quot; i am a member of the governing social democrats - 15 years , i have always been loyal to the brand , and i respect the decision of the party organs . &quot;
so , another lie in the live .
or perhaps sobotkově to call for his resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team forgot that the dvv , 57 percent held that the bohuslav sobotka is a candidate for prime minister ?
the head of the social democrats , however , by summoning dvv until the next sunday made a powerful army of enemies .
his opponents have ten days to fill the e-mails 192 members of this body , as well as a collection of various media gossip and rumors , possibly commemorated the real mistakes sobotkovy political career .
it will be hard to wash your dirty laundry , there will be signs of dark alliance between uhlobaronem zdeněk bakalou and sobotkovým wing .
it will discuss a friendly relationship bohuslav sobotka and an influential advocate radka pokorného .
vybublají disputes in the moravian or moravskoslezské organization Čssd .
they are the words of warning ostravského mayor and sobotkova ally peter kajnara : &quot; i signed the charter 77 so that the country didn &apos;t become idiots . &quot;
if the dvv met here this weekend , liars would have been forced to the ritual sacrifice of their functions .
posypou zrádci , head of ash and will remain .
and now the chief triumphs Čssd then end up with the nickname bohuslav pyrrha .

putin promised a green olympics , his plan dooms the giant secret landfill
winter sports fans have slit a meter in the opening of the olympic games in sochi , others on their preparation with increasing fear .
the russian olympics , even if it starts up in february , is grappling with another scandal .
the russians had apparently failed to fulfill a promise that the preparation and the organisation of the games in the slightest impediment of nature in krasnodarském region in the foothills of the caucasus , where for four months , will head the thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors .
indeed , after the olympics in vancouver , the russians had set the bar very high ranking , the canadian game in the history of the olympics as the most environmentally friendly wrote .
it seems , however , that russian president vladimir putin &apos;s commitment to hold the game with a &quot; zero waste &quot; took a long time ago .
the ap reporters last week discovered a giant landfill building material in the village of achštyr near sochi .
thus the full of building materials , tyres , jerry cans and insulation foam was found in august by environmentalists , which immediately reported .
the russian authorities are broad and landfill disappeared .
but only for a moment .
last week , reporters to a landfill about the size of three football fields .
it is not the only one in the field of several such places , described by the british newspaper the times .
work on the site of the russian railways , the state monopoly , which is building around šedesátikilometrovou trip between the airport and the sports resortem in sochi .
the company , which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles , led by one of putin &apos;s close aides vladimir jakunin .
in august , the railways have prevented that the landfill founded one of the subcontractors .
but local residents are desperate .
according to the population achštyru around the village for three months , day and night driving trucks full of waste material .
according to experts , there is a risk that the waste contaminating the local river mzymtu , other streams and , ultimately , the black sea .
&quot; water from here sočské contaminating water sources for the next ten to fifteen years , &quot; he told the british newspaper vladimir kimajev from environmental ngos ewnc .
illegal landfills are not the only problem for the russian organizing committee and the government .
the most expensive olympics in history , according to the opposition , one big tunnel .
in comparison , the games in sochi will be 51 billion dollars , while the 2008 summer olympics in beijing came to 43 billion .
last year &apos;s games in london were only 19 billion and the vancouverské nine billion .
in addition to the corruption scandals , project delays and fears if , in the end , there will be plenty of snow , too , there have been reports that the work in the exhibition venues and infrastructure will fail to respect human rights .
last month , one of the workers stitched up his mouth to protest that haven &apos;t been paid for two months .
many are also worried about how the russian organizers popasují during the games , with the new law , which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality .
some visitors are going to support russia &apos;s gay in the olympics .
the rules on the use of electronic equipment on the plane will remain in australia for the time being in force
australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones during the launching and landing , and regardless of changes in the us in order to mitigate the rules on these devices .
the u.s. federal aviation administration ( faa ) has given the american companies to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books on its facilities , watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight , when the device will remain in the &quot; air &quot; regime .
passengers can already do this during most of the flight , but many people is that they cannot have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing .
australští carriers are exploring this decision from the american carriers requires a great deal of work to meet the requirements , but indicated that they do not intend to in the near future to change their procedures .
the civil aviation safety authority ( casa ) also said that the announcement of the probe , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight in australia are still in force .
&quot; casa currently has no specific regulations covering the use of electronic devices on the plane , &quot; he said .
this issue is covered by the regulations , which require aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained at all times and that passengers are acting in accordance with security guidelines that will gain from the members of the crew .
the company virgin , which has already spoken with casa to expand the use of its in-flight entertainment system , wi-fi , was inclined to change , but announced that it is subjected to a decision by the regulatory authority .
&quot; we uvítali if the casa has analyzed the permission to use electronic devices , because i really think that now that we have ( wireless in-flight entertainment ) , improve the customer experience , &quot; the spokesman said .
the company qantas announced that for the time being , will hold the current regulations .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing , and we do not intend to change in the short term , &quot; he said .
faa rules apply to american airlines .
eventually , but we are interested in the developments in the regulatory area , which can be useful for our passengers , and be sure to carefully study the faa &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it are .
in the case of air carriers from the united states , the impact of the legislation will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet .
carriers will have to prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones , and revise the manuals , training materials , programs for carry-on baggage and passenger information .
&quot; once the airline will confirm the tolerance of its fleet , may allow passengers to use portable and easy electronic devices , such as tablets , e-readers and smart phones , at any altitude , &quot; the faa said .
in rare cases , the low visibility of the crew ordered passengers to shut down during the landing gear .
the group also recommended that the heavier equipment during take-off and the descent safely stored under the seats , or in the storage space above his head .
nesmysly gravitace are in the movie , but it &apos;s a beautiful sight , say experts
a fantastic film from space vyprodával gravitace some time after the premiere of the movie in the czech republic .
in october , according to the union film distributors saw him almost 150,000 spectators and earned over 26 million crowns .
most of the reviews the picture positively .
others , however , there is some inconsistencies .
the server lidovky.cz asked experts from among astronomers and astrophysicists on how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the movie .
jiří dušek ( ředitel hvězdárny a planetária brno ) : i like science-fiction films , which i think is a modern , dreamlike fairy tales .
film gravitace included , even though he faces as a &quot; real &quot; physical performance .
it is not , but that does not mean that it would be bad .
i užil him very much .
you can be hair všimnout sandra bullock , which somehow raises in microgravity .
hubbův space telescope and the international space station are moving along significantly different orbits , and therefore cannot be seen in one shot .
some viewers of the film about the unreal active effect and the behavior of fire in weightlessness .
they also hold skafandry such wounds .
the heroes in the film gravitace often come into conflict with various objects and suits without much trouble it holds .
even the critique was not spared the plot .
so extensive tragedy in earth orbit , according to some people is unrealistic .
in addition , wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair technique .
people on the forums arguing about the &quot; unrealistic &quot; behaviour of the ropes .
they say it operates as if it was intended for bungee jumping .
marcel grün ( ředitel hvězdárny a planetária prague ) : i saw him only on a broad canvas , but clearly i can say i was enraptured .
i &apos;m glad that it wasn &apos;t a film documentary , but science- fiction .
and in such a story is the author of the law ( almost ) painstakingly consistently reality .
&quot; more than you mention irregularities , it struck me , as it is displayed three space station with the lowering of the level of technology ( the chinese ) for the last time . &quot;
&quot; the chinese will , after all , until the end of the decade , and probably will look better than it is in the movie . &quot;
vladimir karas ( director astronomického ústavu akademie věd Čr ) : the computer-generated scenes , the authors are trying very successfully so that the laws of physics , and so the viewer-oriented přírodovědně will appreciate that the various space conflicts and clashes quite rightly maintains the momentum , said a dictionary physics , also a view of earth from space is very realistic , including a thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering in the polar regions .
irregularities in the indices they &apos;ll find .
additionally , i am reading the commentaries , for example , found that the preferred direction of circulation of space debris in orbit in some scenes appear inverted than it should in fact be ( from west to east ) .
jiří Štěpán ( employee astronomického ústavu akademie věd Čr ) : some things , the creators have adapted to their needs , but no major and blatant offense against the logic , or the laws of nature , i have not seen in the movie and in comparison with other films that focus is to see that the creators have depend on the credibility of the depicted events .
from the moments that don &apos;t make sense it is worth to appoint the fact that the hubble space telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than the iss .
the result is considerably different mutual speed and rescue operation would therefore , in fact , could not take place as displayed in the film .
furthermore , at the moment of the kowalski ( clooney ) and stone ( bullock ) , i noticed that the iss was , therefore , there is no clear origin of the forces acting on the try , which makes both players to go at a time when they are already against each other .
bombardier profit fell as a result of the decline in shipments and orders
canadian aircraft manufacturer bombardier and trains on thursday reported a 15-percent drop in net profit , which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems in the train unit .
the company bombardier , based in montreal , also did not disclose any data on air test for its new cseries aircraft type , nor offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will adhere to an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next september .
after opening a test flight for about a month and a half , the aircraft flew only three times , and this raised the question of whether the test phase is progressing well .
the results have fallen short of estimates and the shares on the stock market in toronto fell by 8 percent .
state bank analyst cameron doerksen declined on thursday rating from &quot; higher returns &quot; to &quot; the power sector , &quot; with the expectation that the stock market will experience over the next quarter or two limited growth .
&quot; while the smaller aircraft deliveries are mostly expected profit margin in the field of transport us greatly disappointed , &quot; doerksen said in a report to clients .
as the test program will continue , we believe that the bombardier cseries aircraft will receive new orders .
if , however , will not be announced in the coming months , no new orders , we assume that the market will increase scepticism towards this programme .
the company bombardier hopes that the aircraft of type cseries probojují into the bottom of the market , which is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test plane was discovered in march , after months of delay , the first flight was held in september .
the number of mandatory cseries aircraft orders , however , amounts to a modest 177 , because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company &apos;s claim on the low consumption and savings on the cost of transport aircraft .
at present , a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators .
the executive director pierre beaudoin expected that when the first plane for commercial use of bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders .
the executives also assured analysts and the media on thursday that the program is proceeding according to plan .
&quot; the plane was on the ground for longer than expected , &quot; beaudoin said in the conference call and said that the examination on the ground and software updates were planned during the shutdown of the aircraft .
each manufacturer is planning to otherwise .
we decided to go through the first year and then focus on the updates and that &apos;s what we did .
this will happen during the entire flight program .
according to bombardier , the second of five test planes to take off in the coming weeks , and the others soon after .
analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer could begin to operate the aircraft cseries 12 months after its first flight .
the company bombardier claims to evaluate its plan to put the aircraft into service and in the coming months will provide up-to-date information .
&quot; this slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in line with the internal plan bombardier - seems to reinforce our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; doerksen said .
the $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , in the previous year , in the third quarter ending september 30 , net profit fell to bombardier to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents .
the turnover &apos;s marginally decreased from 4.2 billion to 4.1 billion .
according to ibes system of thomson reuters , analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4,56 billion .
the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that compared to 57 planes a year before , he added during the quarter , only 45 aircraft .
the net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
nesplněné contracts in the air division accounted for 32.9 billion at september 30 , which is unchanged at 31 december .
&quot; the results in the aviation sector were in line with our forecasts , but the low income of orders and the overall state of the market failed us , &quot; beaudoin said .
the yield in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest producer of trains , said that revenue in the division rose by almost 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
nesplněné contracts in the transport were 32.6 billion at september 30 , compared to 31 december marginal growth .
ziskové margins in the transport division has been affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts .
the executives said that in the fourth quarter will be provided with new perspectives .
shares of bombardier , which also announced the arrival of google &apos;s finance director patrick pichettea , declined during trading on thursday afternoon , about 8.5 percent , to $ 4.83 .
the brazilian company embraer sa , the third-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor , bombardier , announced on thursday a 10 % drop in quarterly profit .

as a result of the tax on foreign owners of real estate bubble bursting in london
