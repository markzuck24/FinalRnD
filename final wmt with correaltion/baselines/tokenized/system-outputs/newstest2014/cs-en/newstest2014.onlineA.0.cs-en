egypt reported to the office of the first freely elected president
mohamed morsi passed the inaugural oath , but its hardly the end of the day the triumphant political unrest in egypt .
an islamist mohamed morsi promised &quot; new egypt &quot; , when it was officially inaugurated as the first freely elected president of this country , and hosni mubarak , after which he was unseated by 16 months earlier .
during his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court has also become the first freely morsi elected islamic president in the arab world and the fifth egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy , approximately 60 years ago .
the oath before 18 judges dressed in black robes in the headquarters built overlooking the nile , which resembles an ancient egyptian temple .
&quot; we strive for a better tomorrow , new egypt , and the second republic , &quot; morsi said in the ceremony wedding ceremony broadcast live on state television .
&quot; the egyptian people today laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said morsi , a trained engineer turned sixty in the usa and a member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization , a target of sharp attacks by individual governments .
when morsi shortly after september 11. hour local time he arrived in a small convoy of cars , they were building hundreds of soldiers and police officers .
only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court to the president , and , in contrast to the presidential pomp of mubarak &apos;s term was right only briefly stopped to allow the column to ride usually busy route linking the city centre with the suburbs to the south .
personal prestige morsi , derisively known as the &quot; spare tire &quot; necharismatická of the muslim brotherhood , has grown sharply since his victory and his friday &apos;s speech , which aimed to present him as a candidate for the islamists , but also all those who want to bring to the end of the revolt against the authoritarian mubarak .
&quot; egypt today is civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; said morsi , clad in a blue suit with a red tie gala judges in the wood-paneled chamber , where he took the oath .
morsi later traveled to cairo university , where he had to recite the inaugural address .
while he stood at attention , he received an official welcome from the military band played the national anthem .
present was the military commander field marshal hussein tantawi .
his arrival was accompanied by chants of &quot; the army and the people are one hand &quot; from the mouth of the hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university .
cairo university was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education , and later in the 1970s. years , has become a bastion of the islamic student movement .
morsi passed on friday a symbolic oath in tahrir square , in the place where was born the revolution , which ended authoritarian rule last year , mubarak , and solemnly promised to once again join hands presidential powers removed his office &apos;s military council , which took over from the vypuzeného leader .
but approval of the composition of the official oath before a court , rather than in front of the parliament , as is the custom , bowed to the will of the army , which suggests that the power struggle will continue .
morsi &apos;s speech at tahrir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
who wants to really get to know a city , you should go to the cemetery .
his visit will reveal more than a walk through the načančaným centre with monuments , churches and art galleries , more than they told bedekr .
many people read from the graves &quot; .
slowly wander cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality .
determine what kind of people live here , what nationalities , what are the beliefs , how large and cohesive families are , at what age are dying here , as are the wealthy , as important for them to have their titles and professions .
how to express their status , how they taste .
and from the graves finds and how about your dead shall see survivors .

frontier airlines is going to charge for carry-on luggage
frontier airlines plans to charge during their years in the amount of up to us $ 100 for storing hand baggage on board .
frontier airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $ 100 for hand luggage and $ 2 for a cup of coffee or a soda , although in its announcement on wednesday said that passengers will be able to retain the full can .
the new fee for carry-on baggage , luggage refers to in the upper storage area , so a small luggage under the seat will still be free .
frontier says it will charge us $ 25 , if the fee has been paid in advance , and $ 100 if passengers will pay to wait until arriving to the gate .
frontier spokesman kate o &apos;malleyová stated that the passenger fee to encourage stodolarový to take care of the payment in advance .
&quot; we chose this fee , &quot; she said .
airlines have begun to charge for the first and second from the luggage in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid these charges and they hand baggage hidden in the storage space , as much as they could , so often lacking in this area .
fees are one of the ways how to teach passengers to get on board to take fewer things .
o &apos;malleyová said that the purpose of this new fee actually is not to get more money .
it &apos;s that the most loyal customers of frontier is clearly expressed , that found a place in the upper storage area is increasingly difficult .
passengers who have bought tickets on the website of the company , to pay .
this means that one passenger in the queue at the gate of the company frontier may bring the baggage , which does not pay anything , while the other passengers in the queue for the same luggage will pay $ 100 .
o &apos;malleyová said that the web site and check-in procedures will be adjusted so as to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee prior to your arrival to the gate .
a new fee the company frontier for hand luggage will not be in force before the summer , but the date has not been set yet .
passengers often on the baggage fees and other charges , but complain about the airlines love them .
claims that the baggage handling costs money , and passengers who require this service , would have to pay for it .
many on wall street see the additional fee for baggage as a sign that the airline is trying to select enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses .
most but on the fees for carry-on luggage held .
company spirit airlines carry-on luggage as the first zpoplatnila three years ago and another low-cost airline allegiant air her example later followed .
the only company , which also has such fees , is a hungarian wizz air , says consultant in the field of air transport by jay sorensen , who carefully monitors the additional charges .
in its report of december 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage company spirit will bring $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , a former senior executive of midwest airlines , recently flew with the company spirit and wondering about what he saw at the gate , when the passengers met with an unusual fee the company spirit for hand luggage .
&quot; getting into the aircraft , it was the smoothest i &apos;ve ever seen in my career in the air , &quot; he said .
i waited at the gate i see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and in the blink of an eye &quot; .
frontier also modeled after the company &apos;s spirit will apply fees for coffee , tea , soda and juice .
frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice , may retain the entire tin and coffee will be free .
the water will continue to be free .
us airways , the company in 2008 briefly attempted to introduce charges for drinks , but after complaints from passengers about seven months later caved in , and no other significant airline it nenapodobila .
the last move the company to charge for carry-on luggage , the frontier if the passenger &apos;s nezakoupí years directly from the airline , is her latest effort to steer customers straight to your website .
the airline pays internet travel sellers such as orbitz , from 10 to 25 usd for each ticket sold .
it could be all the airline companies an incentive to lead passengers to buy directly from them , instead of trying to do it through internet travel agencies .
however , the frontier in this area , as far as it went .

we studied 11 thousand ads !
know where you want to work !
in november last year the analysis caught over 11 thousand advertisements offering work place , 4300 of them was published in the daily press and 6800 adverts ( 62 percent ) on the internet .
the internet is becoming the most important medium for the publication of offers of employment .
even in 2005 , when the survey took place for the first time , its market share was 26 percent .
in the last two surveys ( 2007 , 2010 ) at about 60 percent .
advertising jobs in pursuant to the analysis greatly reflects the current situation on the labour market .
an example might be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in the period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis .
for example , in 2007 , was in the same reference period published almost 25 900 ads , in the year 2012 , it was less than half .
offer jobs on the internet is focused on a narrower , more in particular a qualified group of professions .
by contrast , the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions , including those blue-collar , said the author of the analysis , pavlína Šťastnová .
the rate of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media .
on the internet caught the front places advertisements looking for managers and executives , sales representatives , programmers and financial experts .
the position of the programmers or managers of small enterprises was featured only on the internet .
in the daily press is the proportion of these professions is significantly lower , in contrast , include in particular the representation of a large utility and labor occupations .
among the most frequently given the requirements that employers expressed through advertising , of course , belongs to the menu training .
other reference areas belonged to the knowledge of foreign languages , especially english .
in the daily press was the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language given in three percent of the advertisements , on the internet at 37 percent .
only two percent of the advertisements employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages .
claims for the &apos; computer literacy &apos; appeared in 40 percent of the advertisements ( in the daily press at 11 percent , on the internet at 57 percent ) .
practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads .
the requirements to practice are generally associated with qualified professions .
in particular , the production manager , and other executives .
for blue-collar professions , in particular about the mechanics and the repairman or the manufacturer and processor of food products or repair of electrical equipment , said study author georg tillner .
employers are also in the middle of their advertisements indicate requirements on the characteristics and skills of the candidates .
as the most commonly required skills in advertising in the first place no longer appear in the long term communication skills .
in addition , employers require flexibility , adaptability and dynamism , autonomy , responsibility , organizational skills and reliability .

in the czech republic is now a total of 90 major business centres .
unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 percent of medium-sized and large center .

some of the projects were almost fully booked , but the results have been mostly disappointing at first .
nowadays customers are somewhat conservative and are loath to change their shopping habits .
new business center must try to &apos; entice &apos; their customers on a new brand on the market , entertainment , service , and marketing actions , &quot; said samadi .
the occupancy rate of shopping centres is generally stable , according to sotáka , even some center rises , because the landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of the rent and dopronajmout some of the units .

shopping centre opened in the past two years on the market to promote according to sylvie samadi very slowly .
place on the market for new projects but there are .
the number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited .
for example , in prague , we see room for the construction of the project , which would have served the residents of prague 6 .
the market certainly is a space for the construction of smaller local projects , the so-called &apos; convinience centres &apos; , focusing on shopping and service needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity , &quot; samadi said .
also according to sotáka , there is a place on the domestic market for shopping centres .
and as for the small &apos; handler &apos; , so for large projects in prague , or medium-sized projects , or expansion in the regional cities .
&quot; cities as kladno , České budějovice , plzeň , brno or have room for further growth , &quot; he added as .
in prague he sees room for the upcoming shopping center on victory square , then have it clear the potential street na prikope and wenceslas square .
&quot; intensively developing the expansion of retail parks , which allow traders to cover and expansion into still smaller towns at favourable rents and operating costs , the space is also still in some locations for smaller local settlement or shopping centers , respectively , their reconstruction , such as the reconstruction of the home business prior that benefit from good sites , &quot; added dita kaday of dtz .
in the czech republic is currently placed 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross lease areas .
a quarter of all these shopping centers are located in prague .

report : obama &apos;s campaign considered to replace biden for hillary clinton
president barack obama &apos;s closest adviser , according to the new york times secretly considered to replace on ballot 2012 vice president joe biden for hillary clinton .
this revelation is the most sensation the eagerly anticipated book about 2012 campaign from mark halperina and john heilemanna &quot; double down : game change for 2012 . &quot;
the times won a copy of the magazine coming books and announced on thursday evening that the president &apos;s top associates organized at the end of the year 2011 intensive group meetings and surveys to estimate whether the deprivation is biden would help revive obama &apos;s fading hopes of re-election .
according to the national political correspondent for the times magazine , jonathan martin , the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials in the campaign and in the white house , notably the former head of the office of the white house bill daleyho , to measure what effect the move would have on the election of the former secretary of state clinton to the post of vice president .
the potential change was a closely guarded secret within the chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the oval office .
just a few of the closest presidential advisers--including daleyho , former head of the obama campaign , jim messina , and the former main advisors in the white house , david axelroda and david plouffeho – known to be considering this change .
the book &quot; double down &quot; argue that daley was representative of the efforts to replace biden , despite their close personal relationship , and that in the meantime , before eventually decided not to implement this move , when data showed that adding clinton to the ticket would be &quot; obama &apos;s chances increase significantly . &quot;
in an interview with martin daley confirmed that the administration is really considered replacing biden clinton .
&quot; i researched a wide variety of things and this was one of them , &quot; said daley for a worksheet .
you must not forget that at the time was president of the ghastly prospect , so we thought : &quot; christ , what do we do ? &quot;
while daley described the research as &quot; due care , &quot; martin said of cooper &apos;s history of cnn , that the campaign for re-election spent considerable investments in order to ascertain whether this move in the elections .
&quot; when campaigns are not interpreted such money on elections , and qualitative research , if something really serious for the time being , &quot; said martin on ac360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team is considering this exchange .
martin told cnn that the daleyho asked whether his former boss knew about this potential shuffling the cards .
while daley said that he did not think the president &apos;s potential changes &quot; was aware &quot; , former head of the office admitted that it is &quot; possible &quot; that obama knew about it .
martin said , adding that the book &quot; double down &quot; definitely does not respond to the question of whether the political probe was given to obama on the table .
cooper asked martin whether he really thought that obama didn &apos;t know about research concerning the deletion of the nominee biden .
&quot; maybe , &quot; said martin .
no way , sir hašku .
we have a unique opportunity to say to the politicians that as follows .
it is necessary to develop such a pressure to martin hašek was stripped of all political functions and left the seat .
any other solution will reduce the level of political culture , which is already so slim .
martin hašek zaštíťuje promise that gave , but every politician must be particularly aware of the consequences of that promise , and consider what you can promise .
confidence is the only capital that has policies ( mr. babiš has even the tangible , but the question is whether the policies ) .
the best the program promoted by the liar is untrusted .
in politics is no excuse in politics .
sir hašku , if you &apos;re good with this country ( and your frequent declarations about me , therefore , if you just lie-here you can see how it is , lying difficult ) , you will leave politics alone , like a man .
people then your apology as expression of a man who made a mistake and bears responsibility for it .
otherwise , you will be perceived as a spineless wimp whose words or deeds cannot be trusted .
either you want to be a proud , even if means man or a lifetime sketou .
maybe you think that it is unfair when i called you , but you &apos;re the leader and they just misguided sheep .
and the leader you are and you &apos;ve always wanted to be .
i understand that you are now on a folded ears , regroup forces vysedět the embarrassment and then attack again , but so are partisans or podrazáci .
you are , i repeat , in their eyes , the leader , the alpha male , so be nice .
accept the responsibility and leave from politics .
black box in your car ?
while the american road designers are struggling to find the money to repair crumbling highways , many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into the dashboard of your car .
devices that monitor every kilometre , which a motorist travels , and that convey this information to the authorities , are at the heart of the controversial efforts of washington and the state authorities for planning to renovate the outdated system of financing american main roads .
usually drab design highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations .
libertarians meet with groups of ecologists and lobbied for it , so that the government could use such a small cabinet , which would record the mileage and maybe even where you are going – and then use this information to build a tax assessment notice .
the tea party is horrified .
the american civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy .
and while congress cannot agree on whether to continue , some states do not expect anything .
discover how over the next decade to move to a system in which a driver pays per mile of road , after which it goes .
thousands of motorists have black boxes , some of which are tracking using gps , take the test .
this is a real necessity for our nation .
&quot; this is not a matter of when we can really choose , &apos; &apos; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the association of state administration in southern california , the state plans to launch track mileage for each california motorists in 2025 .
it changes the way we pay these taxes .
to this technology .
the stimulus is the fact that the road trust fund financed by the taxes that americans pay at the pump is at the bottom .
americans do not buy as much gasoline as before .
cars here a lot more miles on a gallon .
the federal tax of 18.4 cents a gallon , for the past 20 years has not increased .
due to the current high price of gasoline , the politicians are reluctant to raise the tax on a single penny .
&quot; gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , &quot; said lee munnich , an expert on transport policy of the university of minnesota .
his state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to this tested system of payment per kilometre .
&quot; from a long-term point of view , it seems like the most logical alternative , &quot; he said .
experts call it the user fee by the number of kilometres travelled .
it is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals , because taxes can be used to change patterns of behaviour of drivers , which , for example , can help reduce traffic jams and the creation of greenhouse gases .
california designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the ambitious goals set out in the law on global warming .
but the republican bill shuster ( pennsylvania ) , chairman of the committee for transport , he said that it also sees it as a long-term alternative to nejfunkčnější .
leaders of the free market from the organization reason foundation are also in favour of the idea that drivers will pay for mileage .
&quot; it is not a tax , which disappear in a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president for strategy in the organization reason .
people pay directly for what they receive .
the initiative also supports the two former american ministers of transport , who urged congress in 2011 , to be issued in the direction of paying per kilometre .
the us senate last year approved a pilot project for us $ 90 million , which was to include about 10,000 cars .
leadership of the house of representatives , however , rejected the proposal and did so due to concerns of rural legislators representing the residents , whose daily life often means to insult many miles for work outside the city .
several states and cities , however , move forward on their own .
the most ardent is oregon , which in the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers .
these drivers will soon begin to pay state tax on mileage instead of gasoline tax .
nevada already has completed the pilot project .
new york just project examines .
illinois is trying to a limited extent for trucks .
i-95 and the coalition , which includes 17 of the state ministries of transport , together with coastal states in the east ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) is studying how they can implement this change .
this concept , however , is not just a supporter .
in nevada , where the device was recently equipped with about 50 cars , the drivers were volunteers , the concern that the government is able to track their every move .
&quot; concerns about monitoring the type of big brother and similar issues were a big problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , who leads the management of the strategy and the operation of the nevada department of transportation .
it was something people wanted .
how to test the project continued , the american civil liberties union in nevada on its website warned : &quot; it would be very easy to turn these devices on full tracking device . &quot;
there is no need to build an enormous dull technological infrastructure that will inevitably spread to record daily departures and arrivals of individuals .
nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles the car runs , but not exactly when and where .
if you can do it , said khan , the public will be calmer .
the hunt for such technology has brought some of the state agency for a small company in california called the true mileage ( actual distance travelled ) .
this company originally into action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers involved .
she wanted to break through the emerging market liability insurance , where drivers pay based on how many here .
but this device , which tested , attracts the attention of designers of the road network , because it does not use gps and provides only a limited amount of information , which are regularly recorded by using a modem .
&quot; people will be more willing to go , if you don &apos;t watch their speed and their location , &quot; says ryan morrison , executive director of the true mileage .
in some of these pilot programs , many big mistakes .
they are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it .
in oregon , the designers are experimenting with the fact that drivers make a choice .
they can choose a gps device with or without gps .
or you may not take any device and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the residents of the state .
in other places , hoping that a prudent public on this concept of proceeds , if the device will be able to more , not less .
in the new york city traffic officials trying to develop the tax device , which would be equipped so that it was possible to pay extra fees for parking hours , to provide insurance according to the mileage and that garnered information about the speed of the other drivers , so motorists can avoid the traffic jam .
&quot; motorists are willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits that they offer , &quot; says design document of the city .
some transportation planners , however , would like to know whether any discussions about paying per kilometre is not just a giant wildcard problem .
officials from the metropolitan committee on transport in the bay area of san francisco say that congress might have a problem with zbankrotovaným road trust fund by raising taxes to solve very simply from the gasoline .
one-off or annual tax could be imposed on the driver of a hybrid or other cars that do not consume a lot of fuel , so that they pay a fair share .
&quot; no radical surgery is needed when enough to take aspirin , &quot; said randy rentschler , director of legislation and public affairs .
if we do so , hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy and a lot of other things .
with a billionaire you call next year ?
kellner , owner of ppf group , wants to buy the operator o2 .
both companies confirmed the talks and according to various resources from agencies and from behind the scenes is said to have a hand in the sleeve .
notification of the transaction should come in november , probably before the auction the frequencies for lte network , i.e. before september 11 . november .
kellner karel komárek &apos;s own competitor group kkcg .
it is under the brand name sazka telecommunications began to auction frequencies for lte network .
and to everyone &apos;s surprise , in the meantime , the taste of the company break into telecommunications .
but now leads a very experienced sazka telecommunications veteran robert chvátal .
he started out as a marketing head of radiomobilu ( now t-mobile ) , later became the director of the slovak t-mobile and the last time that the head of the austrian branch of the same operator .
sazka plays several cards at once .
signed up for auction and now admitted that vodafone wants to run virtuála .
and it makes sense .
if the auction succeeds , to your network will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator .
it would normally like , but vodafone according to the information of the newspaper , it may be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies .
vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competitive operators o2 and t-mobile who will share their networks completely .
vodafone so needs a partner .
and this may just be the sazka .
if it succeeds in the tender for the lte network ( as a newbie can be purchased specially designed spectrum ) , vodafone into the auction at all , or he might not listen to not mind the limited spectrum auctioning ( not enough frequencies for all ) .
vodafone , sazkou of network may share .
vodafone gets sazka into its 2 g / 3 g network ( or newly built network of lte at a frequency of 900 mhz ) , allowing the company a quick start on the network .
sazka between starts to build a costly network of lte , which will be able to use vodafone .
both can be satisfied .
the money saved would then vodafone could spend some hard internet provider or cable television .
and kellner ?
he would buy the o2 czech and slovak ( slovak branch is the daughter of czech ) was immediately a full fledged operator is still decent profits , and a wide range of services .
but on the other hand it is a great moloch , who will wait for the restructuring .
in the auction network lte would be gained for o2 and kellner very likely in conjunction with t-mobile .
both companies already have declared that the networks will share .
the auction could finally end in success , but probably not high enough amounts , which are enjoying the national budget .
and from next year , so customers in the czech republic could choose between the calls with vodafone , t-mobile , kellnerem or komarek .
or the two titans of the czech business against global giants .

police officers spotted sarborougha ( 32 ) , as in the právníkově house in blackburn in lancashire , which has just been to dinner with colleagues from the law society , three bags of cocaine .
on the basis of the tests , in which the traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and credit cards , the investigation showed that the drug was a regular user gowad class and .
during the period of eight months , from january to august 2011 , tried to get information about the tout the arrest of two men in favor of the scarborougha and his companion .
all four suspects were being monitored at that time in the context of a large investigation of trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the areas of lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , lancashire and west yorkshire .
then , during a series of large-scale raids police arrested heroin and cocaine worth about £ 1.5 million , along with 200,000 gbp in cash in prison together with them over the other 32 persons .
ditta ( 42 ) imparted information criminals out of fear that comes to his addiction to cocaine .
today , erica , who works for the law society forbes solicitors are based in blackburn , he experienced before from liverpool &apos;s crown court a shameful moment when he was after třítýdenním version found guilty of that in the two cases , said justice .
during an earlier hearing pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine .
the lawyer &apos;s fall came after the police investigation found that he was scarborougha in february 2011 in regular telephone contact with the dittou .
two detectives suspect they noticed his arrival to dittova house and saw him placed on the purity of drugs 60 percent under the lawyer &apos;s basket in black golf glove .

mr. ditta is accused of abuse of his position of the legal representative and from the fact that he got into too close contact with a particular client .

with some of their clients are too close , especially with scarboroughem , and allowed to be undermined its independence .
ditta misdemeanor refused and said : &quot; if i was a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and i would like to pass on information to mr scarboroughovi , i did not expect 15 hours , but i would do it immediately . &quot;
after the hearing , however , police inspector lee halstead from lancashire , said : &quot; mr. ditta is of counsel in criminal matters became a criminal in a while , when he began to obtain drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his addiction to cocaine has made it hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of the organized crime groups , which gave him the task to collect valuable information about the police investigation .
legal representatives must hold the highest principles of integrity and inspire confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on .
mr. venkatesh that confidence betrayed and tried to hide behind the cloak of their profession .
unit for serious and organised crime in lancashire has led against mr. dittovi investigations , on the basis of which he was convicted for possession of cocaine and three cases now for obstructing justice , which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to all criminals , that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
we will find you and we &apos;ll build before our courts .

&quot; you get a better offer , &quot; he said .
his administration argues that there should be no surprise that 5 percent of the population , that bought insurance for itself , it may be forced to change this program , because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the law on the available care .
&quot; i say that those americans on the plane : you deserve something better , &quot; said sebeliusová in his testimony before the committee on energy and commerce in washington .
sebeliusová that oversees the implementation of the law on the available care , she said , that the internet market was run from october &quot; miserably &quot; .
&quot; i &apos;m disappointed and upset as everyone else , &quot; she said .
i &apos;ll try to get back your confidence .
irritated by the sebeliusová this sentence , which caught on a microphone , said yesterday toward consultants sitting behind her at yesterday &apos;s meeting of the committee , which was held after a stormy exchange of views with republican billy long , a representative from missouri , which concerned whether she herself must engage in the obama program of care .
more than three hours during a hearing on the question asked repeatedly sebeliusovou , why the &quot; architect &quot; of the available care voluntarily gave up the government-sponsored insurance program through the nezakoupil healthcare.gov , that now makes millions of americans .

dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 cnn heroes award candidates for 2013 .
in the competition for the prize cnn heroes 2013 you can vote for him or for any other of the 10 major candidates .
the winner gets $ 250 000 , in order to continue their extraordinary work .
for 21 years he watched his father georges bwelle as again and again falls into coma and goes to hospitals , which were not equipped to help him .
jamef bwelle was in 1981 near the cameroon capital yaounde injured in a car accident .
at first he was treated with only a broken arm , but he subsequently developed an infection that has spread to the brain , and there developed a hematoma that was challenges his whole life .
&quot; there were no neurosurgeons in cameroon , &quot; says georges bwelle .
we had to take him outside cameroon , if we had the money .
instead , he spent the years bwelle by his father hauled into the crowded clinics and hospitals , where he got just such a treatment that was available .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; says bwelle .
you can leave the house at 5 in the morning , rush to the hospital , there was the first , but not the first .
there is a lot of patients .
some people die just because they have to wait .
since 2002 , when bwelleho &apos;s father died , the situation has not changed too much .
according to the world health organization is in cameroon , only one doctor at 5 000 inhabitants .
just for comparison , the ratio in the united states is one doctor to 413 inhabitants .
and even if the doctor kamerunci be able to visit , many would be unable to afford .
two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private .
&quot; the only problem , which is poverty , &quot; says bwelle .
with due to poverty they cannot enjoy life .
when bwelle saw his father and many of their countrymen suffer , decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his team of volunteers have done last year , free 700 operations .
he became the physician of the vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaounde .
and founded the non-profit organization ascovime , whose members at the weekend attending a rural area , where they provide medical care free of charge .
since 2008 , its group of volunteers have helped nearly 32 000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people napěchuje to supply , attached to the roof of the medical supplies and travel in the harsh terrain to villages in need of help .
it is not always accompanied by good luck .
more than once , the vehicle must push through the river and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be welcome as the real heroes : a banquet , singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the community can offer .
in these villages is free medical care actually reason to celebrate and bwelle – with a broad smile and unbridled energy-very willingly engages in the local merriment .
the next day , the team begins to treat hundreds of patients .
&quot; on each quest we have 500 patients , &quot; says bwelle .
come to the village from the circle of 60 miles , and walk away .
during each of these weekends doctors provide different health assistance .
many are treated with malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , parasitic diseases , diabetes and sexually transmitted diseases .
others may get crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate free of charge – a document that calls for the school , but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team makes a simple operation under local anaesthetics .
the operation usually do in the school building , the town hall or at home ; after the surgery , the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room , to make room for the next patient .
using light from a generator , operating room and sanitary equipment , bwelle and its volunteers work into the wee hours .
it is exhausting , but the village musicians usually help team to lose motivation .
&quot; to stay awake , and continued to work , playing on the drums all night , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday , the team will head back to the city , tired , but proud of his work .
this group--consisting of kamerunských physicians and foreign students of medicine--conducted last year 700 free operations and realizes that their aid may mean a lot for the local people .
one man said that after the operation of the hernia will be able to work again .
&quot; it will change the future of our family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to organizing these weekend clinics , and the work of the surgeon in the hospital bwelle also at night works for private medical clinics around the city of yaounde .
he says that this second work is financed by about 60 % of its non-profit activities ; the rest of the cover private contributions .
&quot; i &apos;m not sure when actually asleep , &quot; says katie o &apos;malleyová , that second year studying medicine at the drexelově university in philadelphia and works as a volunteer for the bwelleovu group .
it is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for your organization to these campaigns could do .
for students of medicine and nursing services , such as o &apos;malleyová , who came from the united states or europe to bwelleovi joined on his mission , it &apos;s a great experience that you would at home .
&quot; dr. bwellemu we thoroughly they washed his hands and delete the bloody spots or kept his tools , &quot; says o &apos;malleyová .
as a medical student in his second year in america never go through .
students volunteers usually pay a trip to cameroon and often arrive with egg medical needs .
but as soon as they arrive in yaounde , meals , transportation , and education provides them with bwelle .
&quot; without a doubt it is a hero , &quot; says o &apos;malleyová .
this organization gives his life and his desire to help the inhabitants of cameroon is infinite .
for the bwelleho constant will not load .
helping others live a happier , fulfilling the promise he gave to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy when i &apos;m doing this job , &quot; says bwelle .
and i think of my father .
i hope he sees what i &apos;m doing .
laugh people , alleviate their pain – this is the reason why i do it .

banks said in their joint statement .
&quot; it &apos;s a very good step , &quot; commented on the decision by julian callow , the chief international economist at barclays bank in london .
&quot; so far all the transitional instruments of this type became permanent , so it &apos;s not in my no surprise , &quot; adds vojtech benda , bh securities chief economist .
central bankers bolster bonds , which started in 2007 , when the international credit market for the first time he faltered .
the agreement by central banks to allow access to the euros , dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed it .
central bankers &apos; decision comes at a time when us fed prepares to end its programme of support for the u.s. economy , which could drive the price of money on the global market even higher .
swap contract is typically used to overcome the lack of liquidity of the single currency , while the surplus of liquidity the second currency .
it can be seen as a úložku of one currency and the second currency loan .

the number of hiv-infected has exceeded 1,000 in prague
in the czech republic every year , the number of infected is growing .
for example , in 2002 , the tests confirmed the infection for 50 people , five years later , there were 121 and in 2010 was 180 .
last year was infected with 212 and it was a record number .
&quot; the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 , according to me there is no doubt , &quot; said an expert on the issue of aids , miroslav hlavaty , who for years led the prague house of light for the patients .
according to him , from january to september last year , there were in the country of 165 patients with hiv , this year over the same period , there were 176 .
from the beginning of the track to the end of september last year tests confirmed hiv in 1710 men and 353 women taking most of the infected have been in prague .
their number in september reached 1005 .
in the central region of residence should be 206 infected .
i heard the diagnosis of 156 people from the south-moravian region , 130 of the moravian-silesian or 116 from Ústí nad labem .
at least infected comes from the highlands , there were 19 .
a total of 88 percent of the patients with infikovalo during sex .
fourteen people were infected in the past when a blood transfusion .
this is the case , but from the beginning of testing , i.e. , for more than a quarter of a century , in the czech republic .
with hiv were born six children , transferred to them from the mother .
children should learn the myths and legends such as &quot; models for the way of life , &quot; says the author .
stories about the knight can show that &quot; brute force cannot equal the clever trickery &quot; , while the arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream .
a large part of the myths , &quot; for teaching in the school was too wild , too scandalous and , in some cases too obscene , &quot; said crossley-holland , which calls for careful selection of works corresponding to the age .
&quot; i think it &apos;s great that the myths and folk creation are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i &apos;ve defended this plan after twenty years .
he added that &quot; openly poučující &quot; authors and teachers are u engaging story with &quot; subliminal paid promotions &quot; message for children as a &quot; switch &quot; .
crossley-holland , which translated the epic beowulf and anglosaštiny who also writes the norwegian myths ( penguin book ) and british national stories , says : &quot; you can have good intentions , but you do better when you leave them to themselves . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult the author of an adult and the adult author of writers for children , the need for some sense of hope .
not that everything must be simplified , or end up happyendem , but there must be a natural sense of good and evil .
and that must be a subconscious ; revealed through the story , rather than openly stated .
the old truth that it is better to show than describe .
miloslava cejpková : november smile
came from the outside , from 4 degrees celsius , what we are not accustomed to them .

with the growing plight of the middle class have been experiencing a flowering of pawn shops in singapore
in a pawn shop in the shopping centre of bendemeer singapore stops janani amirthalingaová gold bracelet , ring and earrings , in order to pay for his daughter &apos;s tuition .
&quot; with my husband , we just bought a house and i gave all their money , &quot; says ms. amirthalingaová .
although the each month as the administrator receives $ 2400 ( 3000 sgd ) and her husband also works , family monthly income is insufficient , he says .
demand across the areas in southeast asia--where household debt increases--is indeed such that company superpowermemoryspeedclockpc where a woman performs its transaction , this week on the stock exchange in singapore became the third zastavárnou on the leaderboard .
the jewelry is not only to stop quick route to car rental cash – 1300 sgd in the case of ms. amirthalingaové – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
pawn shops in singapore commonly apply to annual percentage rate 17 percent , just above the 4 percent rate , 15 offered by the united overseas bank bank , a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center .
the pawnshop , however , have the advantage that they do not require verification of persons ( payment history ) or proof of income , and can provide loan faster than banks .
and , therefore , how the families feel pressure because of the rising cost of living and the increasing debt of households and consumer debt , millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , monetary policy in a relaxed , supported by advanced economies , families with low and middle income are turning to pawnbrokers to deal with the deteriorating financial situation .
this week rating agency standard poor &apos;s cited &amp; increasing use of credit in domestic households mainly due to increasing nájmům as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
she said that malaysia , thailand and singapore are due to the gross domestic product , the highest household debt in asia .
malaysia is at the head of the rankings , with a ratio of 80 percent of the gdp , which is an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008 .
economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week just from a technical recession .
on thursday , data showed continuing weak exports and weakening consumer demand .
&quot; it is essential that the rising cost , people from high to low &#91; receipt of &#93; will try to supplement your income , anywhere they can , &quot; said song seng wun , economist at cimb bank , malaysia .
historically high gold prices in the past two years contributed to the fact that people quickly stop your personal assets and use the opportunity to exchange for cash of his family jewels .
about 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 urban zastavárnách are gold .
people say : the price of gold looks good , we &apos;ll stop grandma &apos;s gold necklace and get it back the next month .
the largest operator of the zastaváren in thailand , easymoney , recorded in recent months to increase the number of 20procentní customers using his pawn shop .
growth in the zastavárenském sector is so large that , operator of the branches in superpowermemoryspeedclockpc centre bendemeer and 15 similar in singapore , plans to expand not only to neighboring malaysia , where it has four branches , but also outside of asia , says executive director superpowermemoryspeedclockpc yeah lee ching .
the company will use to fund 60 percent of the 66 million sgd , which this week won on the singapore stock exchange .
while some discount lenders found themselves under siege due to the high interest rates , ms. yeah says that pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders , but it also directly does not increase the debt .
&quot; customers stop items that you already own , and the realisation of the personal property does not increase the debt of the household , &quot; she says .
pledge of assets in the company is becoming more accepted as a means to ensure the short-term financing , secure .
among those who use pawnbrokers , moreover , are not the only people in financial distress .
rich people from singapore also use branches superpowermemoryspeedclockpc when stopping gold bars or rolex watches , and can get up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .
our customers are from all possible circumstances .
&quot; these include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their daring business or investments , or small businesses that need help with solving problems in their cash flow , &quot; says ms. yeahová .

ben greenman : tenth anniversary of the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
you could argue that new york city is the place where america was born solo comic performances : nearly a century ago , variety artist frank fray , who worked as the president of the ceremonies at the palace theatre on broadway , the assembled people began telling jokes by the method of interview .
fayova innovation over the years , most recently through the spread of the new york comedy festival .
the festival was founded and managed by caroline hirschovou , founder of the institution , carolines comedy solo , is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year--along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theaters .
&quot; most of these titles appeared in the carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club , &quot; said hirschová .
this festival we created as an option , how to continue to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes performances by wanda sykesové , kathy griffinové and bill maher , as well as &quot; stand up for heroes &quot; ( stand up for heroes ) , the annual comedy benefit show musically at madison square garden , where in addition to the other will be bruce springsteen , jon stewart , roger waters , and bill cosby .
as well as the spread of this festival , the spread and the world comedy .
several comedians participating in this year &apos;s festival came from non-traditional channels , such as show in smaller radio or television companies , such as comedy central , fx , and spike .
nick kroll swung with his sitkomem ( spicy cheerfully , &quot; league &quot; on fantasticko-football theme on the fxx ) and now has her own comedy show on comedy central .
jenny slateová was a member of both the programme &quot; saturday night live &quot; and &quot; parks and recreation &quot; , but the most famous series of rapidly spreading videos &quot; marcel the shell with shoes on &quot; ( mussels marcel in boots ) .
as kroll , slateová , as well as other young comedians with a clearly recognizable voices ( anthony jeselnik surreálně pessimistic , acerbic , racially oriented w . kamau bell ) , are the product of the decentralized world of american comedy .
one of the biggest attractions of the festival will interview : david steinberg will talk with larry david .
steinberg began as a solo comedian , but became a successful television and film director , as well as the unofficial historian of comedy .
from 2005 to 2007 , held at the station , tv land show called &quot; sit down comedy with david steinberg &quot; .
the meeting is held in the town hall in midtown manhattan .
&quot; this city is definitely in the comedic dna all over larry &apos;s work , &quot; said steinberg .
he told me that when he &apos;s here , sometimes through the alley between the two buildings , and says to himself : oh , man , if i lose all my money , maybe i &apos;ll live here .
many things have moved , and otherwise .
pečinka should be the commentator talked about so that we could agree with it , while the president of the rozdmýchával nesvár Štěch .
governor inmate was a suspect as soon as it chose in the bureau , and endorsed it .
president sobotka has always been , and is a symbol of the misery of the cssd .
other gentlemen showed mainly their weaknesses .
senator dienstbier is consistent and readable and unusable , he is vice-chairman of the most impossible interview on television .
on this basis , i see no better option than to the social democrats proposed for the prime minister , the vice-president of the senate gajdůškovou that one should not start a handicap , and i think that has done standard performance .
this is as good a solution , that hardly anyone from the management .
i add that this solution is the only way to forget what they did , and continue without bursting .
alena gajdůšková , could safely build a minority government with just a blessing from the president of the grupo popular babiš and without apologized , but minister of health hovorkou , which is actually a faithful social democrat .
this minimenšinová the government should great stability , because they promote the proper law of a referendum and has pledged to support president dawn okamura .
the president of the cass b would eventually reconcile with the progression of taxes as it is insightful and sees that it is not without her .
the christian democratic union , nepřinášeli problems , because it carries the best hovorka , what they have , and in the government would otherwise have been .
the same is true of the yes , there could be found valuable , but if the minister reasonably do not enter into risky government involvement , but also provide the support , well .
let &apos;s add courage to alice gajdůškové !

concerns about the safety of mozambique are increasing due to a conflict of strong personalities
under the statue of machely , the mozambican president samory &apos;s founder , in the centre of maputa gathered thousands of people to the rare public demonstration as peaceful .
&quot; we want to back peace ; we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , executive director of the investment company .
out of fear for the future of their country , changed corporate clothing for a t-shirt emblazoned with the words &quot; we demand security &quot; in portuguese and joined thursday to the crowd at independence square in the capital .
after the two weeks were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the renamo party , one of the worst battles since the peace agreement , more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , originally supported by the white government in rhodesia , and then the government of apartheid in south africa as part of efforts to destabilize independent government of this country .
after the peace agreement in 1992 , it became the opposition party .
analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that in open conflict broke out again in the country , but recent events , wished to foreign investors and local .
at stake is a fast growing economy , since the discoveries of extensive coastal reserves of crude oil and coal deposits in the northwest during the next few years may bring on the part of companies such as rio tinto and vale of brazil , the italian eni and the american anadarko , investments worth more than $ 50 billion .
the ruling party , frelimo , the dominant political force since 1975 , and accuse each other of renamo generated tension .
renamo party alleges that the government has sparked the latest conflict by 17 . september launched the attack on their members in the province of sofala , the traditional bastion of the renamo party .
violent bashing former rebels subsequently peaked , when government forces attacked the base of the party and tried to kill renamo afonso dhlakamu , leader of the group , told the financial times the party spokesman fernando mazanga renamo .
the government blames for starting the conflict , because apparently attacked renamo soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to ease the fears of instability .
mr guebuza for the french press agency afp on wednesday said that mr. dhlakama saw himself as a &quot; loser , &quot; which wanted to use &quot; anything of his forces remained to try to prove that the government may impose their own decision &quot; .
both frelimo and renamo claims that they want to avoid war .
but fears grew when she cited the words of mr mazangy , the renamo party withdraws from the 1992 peace agreement .
the ft said that sheet that he thought the party frelimo already deal fails .
&quot; our goal is to return to negotiations , but with seriousness , &quot; said mr. mazanga .
previous talks between the parties have made to alleviate the tension between the parties , a number of skirmishes in the rozdmýchané this year , just a little .
it &apos;s a dogfight between two big personalities ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , said the lecturer at the open university and an expert on mozambique joseph hanlon .
neither one of them is not a good negotiator , and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
party renamo , which sought the electoral changes , have already expressed that they boycotted the municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort of the moribund movement obtained from government benefits and financial proceeds .
renamo party &apos;s share of the vote since 1992 , while the newer party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( dhm ) , which was founded by a former member of renamo , in accordance with the expectations of his position in the elections .
mr. mazanga says that mr guebuza--which ends next year , a second term--he wants to destroy the democracy of this country .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t want democratic system more parties , does not want transparent elections , does not want peace , because it doesn &apos;t want to let go of the presidency , &quot; said mazanga .
it is unclear what renamo party has , but carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on a police station and vehicles on key road between north and south .
most of the skirmishes have occurred in the province of sofala , which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital city maputo , but where is the city of beira , the port on which rely on mining companies , including rio tinto and vale , when its exports of coal .
in june the company rio suspended for about a week of using the railway , when the party renamo has threatened , that this line of attack .
mr. mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether renamo repeats his threat .
renamo wanted to &quot; warn the international community that the situation in mozambique is not good , &quot; said mazanga .
instability has increased the frustration of the government , said fernando lima , head of the independent media company mediacoop , and many people also has concerns about corruption , the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings .
&quot; people think that the responsibility for the country &apos;s future is borne entirely by the government and the president , and that he has to be the one who finds the solution to the problems , &quot; he says .
protester omar sultuane says , that people just want stability .
&quot; no one cares nor renamo nor frelimo , people just want peace , they want to have free access on the road , &quot; he says .

he denied , however , that the changes were made at the request of mr. obeida , who , as mr. tripodi said , urging on the shift in the government lease policy .
a transcript of conversations presented in the icac showed calls from august to september 2007 between the lords of obeidem and tripodim and steve dunne , head of the official on the resort ports came after he worked under mr. obeidem in the department of state for fisheries .
&quot; was the theme of the conversations during these phone calls policy development commercial leases ? &quot; asked assistant commissioner anthony whealy of mr. tripodiho .
&quot; no , &quot; replied mr. tripodi .
i can &apos;t remember what we talked about , but certainly not about this one .
certainly not between me and mr. obeidem .

aircraft manufacturers disagree on the width of the seats at stake are large orders
among the leading manufacturers of aircraft with the dispute about the width of seats in 2nd class on long distance flights , which this month occasioned a bitter exchange of views at the air show in dubai .
the subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class – not just the one which would have usually preceded the airlines , but for which the allocated space is the key to the demands on the efficiency of the companies for the last aircraft of airbus sas and boeing .
airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class , but the main american rival boeing says that they have to decide about the airline .
the dispute arose at a time when manufacturers compete in the sale of the biggest version of the twin-engine long-range aircraft with his potential record number of orders as expected during events from 17. into the 21st century . november .
how is the rear part of the aircraft spread over--especially if it is side by side 9 or 10 seats--is the basis of economic performance claims , proposals for new aircraft &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; .
boeing says that the improved model &quot; 777x &quot; carry 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spaced 10 in each row .
airbus says that the competitive version of its model a350 will take 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats allocated after 9 .
the giant aircraft often attack each other in technical issues through ads in professional media .
airbus now before the air show in dubai , where it is expected that 777x gets the edge with more than 100 orders , appeals directly to the public .
recently , tentatively showed what may be the beginning of a new advertising war , when financiers showed the slide showing three people crowded in the restaurant with the headline &quot; let you enjoy it ? &quot;
&quot; boeing promotes long-haul flights , in seats closer than they are in the regional turbo-prop aircraft , &quot; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
how to change návky , people are eating more , but seats in aircraft are radically changed .
since the beginning of the 70 &apos; s. years ago , when boeing 747 jumbo has defined the modern long-distance air transport , to the turn of the century , according to the data of the ministry of health , the us weight average american aged 40 to 49 years of age increased by 10 percent .
according to the american health statistics has the average american in the 21st century. century , 100 cm in the waist .
airbus contends that his rival holds the concept of 50 seats. years ago , when the average width of the seats of the newly pokřtěného aircraft was lower .
airbus claims that the company has conducted research which suggests that seat about 2.5 cm extension will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent .
the dimensions of the seats of the boeing airbus refuses and says that it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airline fees and equipment exports .
the company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat .
&quot; really it &apos;s about to give airlines flexibility and allow them to do things they believe , that is a must do in order to be successful , &quot; said an expert on the cab area of kent craver .
they don &apos;t want us to them than what they gain .
they know their business better than anyone else .
it is essential for the passengers more space for the elbows , but the vendor is a growing problem that can affect yields .
for this dispute is a race in orders for aircraft with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth of at least $ 700 billion at catalog prices , enough to shift the balance of american and european exports .
as stated in july , reuters , the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the latest battle between aircraft .
both airbus and boeing argue that reaching for their most recent long-haul twin-engine aircraft designs by 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment , the model of the boeing 777-300er simulators with 365 seats .
performance claims boeing partly depends on the comparison of the design of the model 777x with 10 seats in a row and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row .
profit in the unit cost is compared to the 10sedadlovému concept of a weakened .
&quot; the reason that boeing does is to stuffed it more seats , and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , head for the comfort of passengers in airbus for europe .
on the other hand , analysts say , that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in accordance with the fact that many passengers for denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees .
&quot; forty-two inches wide seat for passengers would be great , but the reality is that from a business point of view the airbus proposal is motivated by the threat model , the 777 , &quot; said an expert on the interior of the cabin , mary kirby , founder and editor of the portal runway girl network .
airbus and boeing are not seats , but offer the airlines of the catalogue of suppliers to choose from .
scestovalí aircraft dealers even carries the measuring zone to examine the competitive arrangement .
while boasting comfort , all manufacturers also offers aircraft with highly dense arrangement for low-cost carriers and regional travelers .
the airbus a350 model offers 10 seats in a row , but says he wouldn &apos;t sell it yet .
recently , airbus has stressed the need for greater editing booths , offered on some of its aircraft , a wider seat in the aisles .
experts say that without the support of a single large modern aircraft manufacturer further prompted to new industry standards will remain , but they can discourage sales of wool 777x .
cme focus on the television business .
released almost a quarter of the people .
media group cme shed will be .
by the end of the year to zeštíhlet of thousands of people .
cut back all of the ancillary activities and intends to focus on its main only wants the business , tv broadcasting .
the group , which owns tv nova in the czech republic and in slovakia , bulgaria , romania , croatia and slovenia , employs a total of around 4 500 people .
the work comes almost a quarter of the people .

part of the cme is a company cet 21 , which holds the licences for the television stations of nova , nova cinema , nova sport , fan , smíchov , it and the czech version of mtv .
how much savings affect the czech republic , where the group employs about 650 people , and what it will mean for domestic television &apos;s &apos; &apos; tv nova , yet is not .
&quot; it is premature and we really can &apos;t comment on it , &quot; said communications director nova josef koukolíček .
according to the information ministry today , significant layoffs are inevitable , but the czech republic is certainly by far the greatest impact this should have on the staffing levels of branches of cme in romania and other countries .
both new bosses novy christoph mainusch and michael del nin , who entered after the longtime director , adrian sarbuovi , during a conference call with analysts wednesday , talked about , they want to restrict all activities directly related to the television business .
it is therefore quite likely that significantly reduces the costs for the production of own programmes , film and production activity .

in 2011 , google has made for patents the company nortel default quote of $ 900 million .
google increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $ 4.4 billion .
then he was in the fight of nortel patents defeated by rockstar , earned $ 12.5 billion , google , motorola mobility , which was partially motivated by the trade group , motorola &apos;s patents .
&quot; despite the failure to attempt to obtain in an auction of patents that are the subject of dispute , google patents infringed and continues to infringe , &quot; says in the lawsuit .
the company rockstar aims for increased compensation from google , because it is a violation of a patent by google intentionally , according to the lawsuit .
george kerevan : divided europe gives the scots on the selection
another day , another creepy story about independence .
this time it appears warning that the condition for membership of an independent scotland within the eu would be his entry into the schengen area .
this occasioned for stories on passport checks in berwick and ostnatém wire along hadrian &apos;s wall .
the truth is that newspapers have reported the possible economic benefits of strathclyde freedom of movement with the rest of europe , but – as you might expect – it did not translate into the headlines of newspapers .
no one mentioned that the eu member states spend the amount of time by adapting its official laws , if it suits them .
whereas , now that scotland is not in schengen , the offer of ongoing non-compliance would be for brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the scots really want .
so it &apos;s a pretty weak story .
and , moreover , so old that it became obsolete . canard that &quot; independence is passport control &quot; , i &apos;ve heard from at least 40 years ago .
yet this bearded story hides one interesting idea .
why should they ever have expected that an independent scotland will listen to europe ?
why replace the collar for the brussels london , especially now ?
this is the real story : the great european postwar plan to unite europe finally failed .
the influence of the euro crisis is the so-called project europe officially dead .
across europe are gaining influence party dedicated to resistance to the abolition of the eu or the euro as a common currency .
even in germany much euro-skeptical party alternative for germany-based this year--came out of nowhere and already in september &apos;s federal election she captured nearly five million votes from the bundestag , thereby essentially &quot; vymetla &quot; free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) .
on the domestic front has always been a resistance to a plan to create a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment .
efficiency which is dictated by germany and the european central bank , together with the navléknutou on the straightjacket of the national economy through adherence to a common currency have led many people to believe that the project europe has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national government is running a high budget deficit – it was only true in the case of greece .
rather , it is about the euro system , which blocks their members on exchange rates favorable for german exporters – and that &apos;s the german politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency to southern europe in the area of domestic production compared to the disadvantage of germany .
the only use is to cut income and public spending – which encourages the germany .
for the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of languid performance .
as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy policy supported by brussels – code for the support of the french and german companies at the expense of the consumer – the european industry twice more for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the united states .
this is paralyzing the disadvantage in terms of cost , as we have already seen in the case of grangemouth .
not all of the freezing of salaries in the world , made his mark in the european petrochemical industry zadupání cheap slate oil from the usa .
the result is a smoldering revolt , especially in france , once enthusiastic supporters of the eu .
after the war , the political elite in france saw the eu as a tool that will rein in germany and to paris to stand up in the world on the level of washington .
berlin but paris doesn &apos;t need political legitimacy as the pass and pushed through in europe with its own economic policy and worn the french economy left to their fate .
the result : marine le pen , the right-wing , anti-european national front , won the crucial additional options and postponed the ruling socialists to the third place .
the queue is now with 24 % of the votes as the most popular party in france--an early warning for the british labour that they cannot conclude that fission right will automatically be positively reflected on the left .
how le pen loaded with his newly acquired popularity among the white working class ?
in the european elections next year would like to use to across the european parliament created the antievropský block of acting against the common currency .
if you keep these parties anti-european election well , which is likely , such a block for the first time in the history of the european parliament to dominate .
i think that in the foreseeable future is the growing protievropský feeling and stance against the common currency and the euro will destroy .
the eu will not disappear , but rather transformed into something freer in the meaning of &quot; europe ( sovereign ) of nations &quot; , general de gaulle preferred .
germany and several of his satellite might leave the euro &apos;s economies , but france and southern europe restores its own currency .
i expect that the united kingdom from this project will be to distance itself and přimkne to the united states .
however , increased interest in washington about the pacific suggests that the kingdom will be left the atlantic cold .
and where is scotland ?
we can choose to be areas ( in principle ) the little england .
or we can defend their own economic interests – it is even the possibility to notify brussels , berlin and , when they leave us be .
i assume that scotland would be in a relaxed sequence europe performed well , provided that it kept its own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries would be simpler in non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should take an example from norway and retain their economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is , oddly enough , the most successful — — political movement lack the austerity measures in europe , which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opozičnímu position against the cuts , which had planned ( and implemented ) labour chancellor alistair darling and the following coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats .
it would be ridiculous , if scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures were dictated by berlin and brussels .
the parents of intersex children can choose &quot; indeterminate gender &quot;
germany became the first european nation which recognises a third gender in children born with ambiguous sexual devices .
newborn children will no longer be sorted only to either the male or the female gender .
the new law does not require from the parents for such children have any sex , and allows them to their native worksheets include gender as &quot; indeterminate &quot; or &quot; unspecified &quot; .
the aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to your child , rashly decided for the operation for the purpose of determining sex , and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexual .
intersexual person according to the bbc one after many years , she said : &quot; i am neither male nor female . &quot;
i stay slátaninou created doctors , bruised and scarred .
it is estimated that every year from 2000 for children born to one that is neither a boy or a girl .
they are part of the group probably intersexual 60 the fact that fall in the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testes ) or abnormally developed genitalia .
wallis simpson could be intersexual .
determining gender is still not fully understood , but most experts in the united states says that when you cannot determine the sex , it &apos;s better to use the best available information and identify them , instead of waiting and watching , the psychological and physical development of the child in the meantime before the operation executes , if at all .
new york psychiatrist jack drescher , a doctor who specializes in problems with specifying gender , said that the new german law &quot; looks like a good thing . &quot;
intersexual children represent the ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people are in life-threatening condition that requires surgery , but for most children this is not so , &quot; he said .
sex determination can be done without surgery , and then can wait how identity develops .
knowing how your child develops a gender , not too accurate .
no one can answer the question , why this is happening .
it &apos;s like a mystery , why are some people gay .
a message transmitted to the european committee in 2011 , described the intersexual people as distinct from the transsexuálních or transgenderových people , because their status is not bound by gender , but on their biological structure , which is not exclusively or male or female , but typically consists of both and it cannot be clearly defined as not one of them .
these features may occur in secondary sexual characteristics , such as the muscle volume , the scalp , the bust and the figure in the primary sexual characteristics , such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs , or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones .
this report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area , and also the level of harassment , violence and prejudice .
no gender nonconforming boys now have a special camp .
australia and nepal already allow adults to indicate in the official documents of the male , female , or &quot; third gender &quot; .
norrie may-welby , aussie , 52letá , in june became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; sexless &quot; when she won a court appeal that could leave by the end of life status &quot; indeterminate &quot; sex .
according to the ministry of the interior will have german passports in addition to m ( male ) or f ( female ) and a third designation , x for intersexual people .
in neighbouring france , according to news reports on france 24 gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , the dozens of french legislators from the countries have signed a petition to the heavily catholic , that of school textbooks was removed &quot; gender theory &quot; .
the american web site catholic online to the german law also defined and wrote : &quot; with the way the world is being dragged to a new state where sex is a matter of choice , but sexual activity , we twist the inside out two more pillars of civilization . &quot;
one mother of a newborn child from maryland also said for baby zone , they would prefer to see children assigned sex at birth .
&quot; parenting itself is stressful , even without the additional restrictions , especially if you don &apos;t know the sex of your child , &quot; for web sites relating to parental care .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites , and according to a handsome river , which had a dual sex .
and about ten years back to the medical community believed that gender is something like a whiteboard , which can erase and redraw again .
but now many are questioning the ethical base of operations with the understanding that gender is a complex matter and doctors may sometimes decide incorrectly , because they don &apos;t know how due to their gender , children feel when they grow up .
&quot; in the mid-20th century. century called it a psychiatric emergency room , &quot; said drescher .
when these children were born , they haven &apos;t called you &apos;re a psychiatrist , but a surgeon .
persistent theories about how to treat children with ambiguous sex , was presented by dr. john moneyem at johns hopkins university , who held the view that gender is pliable .
created a new concept of &quot; gender competence &quot; and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how parents raised their child--operated on the baby &apos;s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether it was identified as male or female .
but in one case from the year 1966 , known as the &quot; john / joan &quot; , his theory became controversial .
the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly performed circumcision , recommended that her child had completely removed and castrate his testicles and raised him as a girl .
&quot; the media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion , but the reality was different , &quot; said drescher .
when the boys were 15 years old , he přeoperovat back on the boy and married with a woman .
in 38 years , however , he committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors &quot; this model use &quot; today .
but in the 1990s. years , with the advent of the internet , with the survivors of these operations have discovered the &quot; unhappy with the result . &quot;
it was a case of jim bruce , 36letého writer from montana , who was born with male chromosomes , but ambiguous sexual devices .
the doctors were not sure whether the large clitoris or small penis , and were convinced that the man could never live &quot; life satisfaction &quot; .
and so shortly after his birth in 1976 were bruce surgically removed external authorities and testicles and was raised as a girl .
in the 12 years he got female hormones .
&quot; i knew that i &apos;m not a girl , &quot; told abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was very hard to ask .
at 18 he was sent to the plastic sheath .
but because he was depressed , and he knew that something was not right , asked for medical records .
what he found was frightening .
after the birth i was sterilized and no one ever said anything to me .
bruce was born with a disorder of sex development ( dsd ) , which the body to produce sufficient testosterone defended in order to properly develop its sexual organs .
after he learned the truth , turned back to the man , he took testosterone benefits and let you remove the bust ,
the operation caused the infertility .
today represents another organization called the interface project , and try to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual .
but anne tamar-mattisová , director of the legal group advocates for informed choice ( supporters of an informed choice ) , based in california , is concerned that the german law &quot; calls for calibration and stigmatům &quot; .
&quot; many of the activists are worried that german law accomplishes that will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose for the child &apos; indeterminate &apos; , &quot; she said .
we &apos;re afraid that it prompts for intervention .
we believe that it is better to assign male or female gender , and then wait .
but we don &apos;t know how the law eventually will ring , so all we can do is speculate .
tamar-mattisová said her organization supports the australian law because it &quot; allows the adults to choose to be included in the third gender &quot; .
&quot; an adult should be able to make legally valid sex their own decisions , &quot; she said .
german law is going to allocate it at birth .
it is a battle which should at this point a small child to seduce .
when they grow up , they can about her own body to make its own decision .
but dr. arlene baratzová , radioložka chest from pittsburgh , who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development , and helps hundreds of others in a support group , she said that the german law &quot; grants the powers of &quot; how parents , children .
baratzové &apos; s daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but has the dsd called insensitivity syndrome on androgens .
because of its androgen receptors are defective , katie developed female characteristics .
my vagina , but does not have the uterus and ovaries .
katie 29letá is now married and in the framework of the studies at the university of pennsylvania is working as an intern at a children &apos;s psychiatric ward .
although it is barren , he hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood .
&quot; the law gives parents some leeway to make his decision to them , &quot; said baratzová .
it gives them time to perform certain tests and think about it , and it gives them time to write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; .
in this respect , everything is ok – you educate your child and you love it .
you have an amazing baby and we celebrating for .
you don &apos;t have to rush with the operation , which is irreversible .
&quot; it brings the opportunity to participate in decision-making and the baby and takes away the anxiety that parents &quot; because they don &apos;t have confidence that they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
finally , the child decides how the sex is more identified – and it is a great thing .
it gives kids the power to make their own decision .

karel uhlířský vrch-drábek : one of our youngest volcanoes .
uhlířský vrch is a conspicuous hill , 3 km southeast of bruntál .
along with several other is evidence of volcanic activity in the low jeseník in time ( from the geological point of view ) recently .
the last eruption here were still at the beginning of the quaternary .
when viewed from a distance is on the top of uhlířského hill , the striking white-plastered the baroque pilgrimage church of the virgin mary , built in the years 1755-1765 .
replaced the original wooden chapel of pilgrimage .
the inn , which stood next to the church , got involved .
shortly after the completion of the church was planted by an alley of four rows of linden trees , about 1 km long .
way of the cross on the hill uhlířském is already the third version , the original here was after 1916 , the second , in 2001 , lasted only until 2004 .
the fifteen stations are wooden sculptures by local artist-carver františek lal n .
he used a variety of tree species in the area of the low jeseník .
similarly , the base of the rocks of the area are interesting geological exposure .
at each stop and the name of the sponsor .
uhlířský vrch is the rest of the young volcano .
although the data from the radiometrických measurement of the age of the somewhat different , the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago .
it is therefore younger than velký roudný ( age 3.3 million years ) and older than the pinball volcano ( 0.8 million years old ) .
the volcano was born .
a considerable amount of volcanic ash ejected along with fragments of rocks from the bedrock , that burning have reddish brown in color .
at the end of this phase , spilled on the surface of the lava-today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful .
the second eruption ejected red , red-brown and black tuffs .
their coat is powerful up to 50 metres and her part is accessible in the wall of the quarry .
in tufech are prominent volcanic bombs up to 1 meter large . the second eruption was topped off with the release of lava .
at the conclusion of the activities of the volcano spilled lava , which today consists of up to 50 m mighty struskovitého basalt layer .
the volcano , which replaces the vyvrhování volcanic ash with the discharge of lava are the most common type of volcanoes .
because they are actually composed of layers , were given the name of stratovolcanoes .
the original volcanic cone has been subject successively erosion .
at risk , however , was up to the extraction of rocks in the quarry on the south side .
the most intense quarrying took place here in the years 1953-1962 .
tuff is added to the concrete , which was lighter and had a better thermal insulating properties .
the extraction was under pressure from experts and the public to stop and thus preserve this unique place .
the problem is , however , porosity and small rocks , which quickly cohesion zvětrávají , crumbling and sesouvají down the slope .
the quarry so relatively quickly disappearing .
to make matters even more complicated , it &apos;s a warm , south-facing slope ideal for some rare species of plants and animals .
the axle is therefore problematic , but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a distinctive geological profile .
it &apos;s nothing new , similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites .
uhlířský vrch you get on the green tourist mark from bruntál , possibly from the silesian kočova .
motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the linden avenue , where it begins and a short nature trail .
drunk doused the house with petrol : it burns down a threatened even with your own family !
the voltage is increased , the fear continued .
the man began to threaten , that will set the whole house .
therefore , instead of taking all available police patrols in the area , as well as a unit of firefighters from mladá boleslav and a unit of volunteer firefighters .
the place has arrived and a police negotiator , that the men tried to his irrational behavior .
the man continues to be threatened , the house burns down .
the house had to enter unit , which neutralized and gags .
the aggressor then ended up on the examination in all of the hospital , where he was taken to a detoxification gripper station .
firefighters eventually house over gasoline showered , who later clean up work .
the house was in addition persons rescued , moreover , also all pets .
police negotiators , the man said , so for him the squad .
anger over the judgment handed down by over osnovatelem bombing in bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bombing in bali in 2002 , suddenly angry reacted to the judgment rendered by the over the last of the plotter , who were brought to justice , and said that umar patek was supposed to be executed .
patek , who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in southeast asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for that , compiled by explosive devices , which have been used in the bombing .
for 15 years he could be paroled .
this 45letý man has been found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of kuta , which left 202 people dead , including 88 australians , and many injured .
he was also found guilty in several other terrorism-related counts , including a series of bombings at churches in indonesia on christmas eve 2000 .
the prosecution demanded a life sentence , although it could insist that the man with the nickname &quot; demolition man &quot; ( bourač ) due to its reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives , got the death penalty .
this decision again has revived painful memories of june corteenové , the mother from perth , who , when a devastating attack by running patekem and other osnovateli almost ten years ago lost their 39letá twins jane and jenny .
with tears in her eyes she said , feet should be sentenced to death .
i really think that should follow in the footsteps of the others .
for the agency , mrs. corteenová told aap : &quot; it should be built before a firing squad . &quot;
every day i have to live with the fact that i see other grandchildren and his daughter .
sari club was flattened when she was 12. shortly after the october 2002 23. a strong bomb detonated an hour that is located in the van parked outside .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only about 20 seconds before a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives .
as a result of the explosion fell into a coma for a month , and while he was kept alive , three doctors &quot; died &quot; .
mr hughes said that should meet pateka the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell responsible for the massacre i džamá – amroziho , muchlase and imam samudru – who were executed four years ago .
this guy should get the death penalty as a nobody .
keep him alive ... no reason to hold him still alive , just not .
get 20 years for that , 202 people killed and hundreds of others wounded , again not so much .
he stood before the court friday as the last of the bombers in bali .
he avoided arrest for nearly ten years , but eventually he was caught in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where less than four months later , u.s. forces killed the former leader of al-qaeda &apos;s osama bin laden .
during the trial the fbi agent in his testimony said that intelligence reports have revealed that presser was in pakistan to meet with bin laden in an attempt to re-establish the connection between the terrorist groups from southeast asia and al-qaeda .
&quot; gave up voluntarily , &quot; said mrs corteenová .
until today , he felt regret for it , how much grief caused the second .
the verdict comes before 10. the anniversary of the attack , which will later this year and which will include a ceremony on bali and australia .
&quot; this year we &apos;ll see a lot of tears , &quot; said mrs corteenová .
patek is still may appeal against the judgment .
pope francis called in february the first cardinals
on thursday , the vatican announced that the pope francis 22 . february , for the first time called the new cardinals of the catholic church .
the cardinals are in the catholic church &apos;s clergy have the highest position after the pope and the pope are the ones who vote , so francis said his first group of men who will choose his successor .
it is now 201 cardinals .
however , once the cardinal reaches the age of 80 years , cannot participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 opting for cardinals .
in a statement notifying the father federico lombardi this message , a spokesman for the vatican , said that before the ceremony elevating new cardinals will be held meeting of the current cardinals , known as konzistorium .
&quot; the pope , františek decided to communicate its decision to convene february konzistorium in advance , in order to facilitate the planning of the other assembly , which require the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world , &quot; said lombardi .
jack valero from catholic voices said that the number of cardinals opting to february is likely to fall .
he said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals , how many it is necessary that the number of constituencies increased again to 120 , and so many cardinals over age 80 years , how much he wants .
konzistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after francis was elected in march of this year , said valero .
at this point , manifested a certain orientation on europe , europe and especially italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to watch whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world , in order to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of roman catholics is in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
it will also be the first choice of cardinals ever since , what francis instituted the council of cardinals , the group of eight cardinals from around the world , that he gave the task of finding ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope ruled everything for himself .
&quot; now , francis chose these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said that it is &quot; quite possible &quot; that the cardinals the pope asks for advice .
in this situation we were before – it is a complete novelty .
valero said that the popes traditionally povyšovali to the position of the cardinals to the bishops of the big sites , but francis is &quot; full of surprises — so we don &apos;t know who &apos;s name &quot; .
announced a series of racing land rovers
the interior has a racing seat and a six-point safety belts and intercom .
the brakes are improved , service package providing access to mechanics bowler works , logistical support and storage of the vehicle between the races .
drew bowler bowler motorsport , technical director , said : &quot; the participants , who are coming to the bowler , have changed . &quot;
not all are experienced racers , but they are the people who want excitement and adventure , and also achievable path to world class racing .
we are pleased that this trip in cooperation with land rover and msa we can offer , and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in the uk and overseas , and to prepare the contestants on the hardness and the reality of the rally raid races .
the development of wagon defender challenge we really enjoyed--it will be a really exciting competition .
defender challenge in february will offer a training and test day and also the opportunity to compete in desert races in the north africa and the middle east .

secret war : syria , libya and iran .
training for obama , how is bombing syria .
american commandos in libya .
top gun in the persian gulf .
the israelis showed exactly how you want to look like the bombing of syria .
without unnecessary hype , threats and statements sent aircraft million , you hit the target , and back .
without a lulled the official elimination of chemical weapons in syria .
the entire action of refusing to confirm and do not express it .
the exact opposite of a confused and grandiose , the acts of the obama administration &apos;s enforcement of the syrian policy .
and the most satisfying on the whole attack was what the israelis bombed .
don &apos;t be fooled by the media of their allegations that the bombed syrian &quot; base &quot; or &quot; hizbaláh &quot; supplies .
i recently wrote here about the fact that while u.s. aid secular insurgents in the country remains only on the rhetorical level , russia supplied weapons on syria .
and a fresh shipment of russian missiles landed in the port of latákija has become the target of the israeli raid .
a clear message .
and note , israel again bombed asadův mode , not the insurgents , although according to the popular internet theories should be vice versa .
the u.s. government honored 2 spaciálních units , probably members of delta force .
netušilo , so far , that have distinguished themselves during the attack on the american consulate in bengází .
it is known for the heroic death of two former national seals , who defended the cia &apos;s campus in the city , according to me it was the members of secret commandos the cia , which is made up of former soldiers .
it has been speculated for a long time , what did the seals at the consulate or even in a residence located elsewhere the cia .
now it is clearer .
in any case , the information that the cia has its offices in libya kulometnými protected nests ( just on one that both members of the seals have perished after the intervention of minometem ) , it is quite surprising .
but even more surprising are the information about those two yet unknown heroes .
they were part of the american commandos in tripoli , and as soon as they got a report on the attack in the bengází has voluntarily signed up for the intervention and , along with five private contractors shot their way into the complex &apos;s cia in the bengází .
the obama administration shoots itself by the fact that during that attack wasn &apos;t it officially deployed and the entire squad and that he simply hesitated what to do .
the commander of the commando , apparently released without these volunteers .
anyway , that operating in the country not once , but permanently american commandos , the cia and the private kontraktoři is quite interesting information .
and whereas , until recently officially no such thing but never acknowledged and even now only talks about some sort of advisory mission to nato in libya .
but it is good that the us although half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in libya .
even if the situation is to resolve the nationwide that want to help a lot more .
the last place a secret and permanent conflict , of which today i want to write is the coast of iran .
not so long ago , the media almost she carried on about the iranian air force for the prosecution of us completely .
little is known , however , how the americans their drones effectively protects .
of course , if you happen to be able to discover your dron in the airspace , you can &apos;t do anything with it .
however , if discovered by the iranians in the area of international dron , the situation is completely different .
and so it happened that the iranian f-4 phantom persecuted american international dron space above the sea when there was maybe the first deployment of american super sharp fighter f-22 raptor in history .
the podletěl phantoma to optically verified its armament , without him the phantom has registered on the radar or it &apos;s just noticed and then when suddenly appeared to him and urged the iranian pilot to return home , he listened to without complaint .
no wonder , when the phantom is an american production , which , however , remembers the vietnam war .
to the damn can &apos;t compare .
the court blocked the regulations relating to the procedure for stopping and searching people in the ny police department
a federal appeals court on thursday blocked the injunction requiring changes in the program to stop and search people on the police department in new york and the judge from the case .
the other american federal court of appeal said that the decision of the judge of the scheindlinové will be deferred until shiry to the decision on the appeal , which the city has made .
the judge decided in august that the city violated the constitution that has implemented its program stopping and questioning people .
the city of its conclusions and its provision of regulation , including a decision to allocate supervision which would police department helped to change their processes and your training program with them .
the appeals court heard arguments on tuesday for the postponement .
the appeals court said the judge in the case must be revoked because she got into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges , and the fact that as the judge had not acted in accordance with the request to avoid the appearance of partiality , partly due to a series of interviews with the media and the public by openly responded to criticism of the court .
the judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , when they wrongly focused on blacks and the cholos that were hanging in the framework of its programme to stop and search people .
establish an independent surveillance to keep an eye on the main changes , including reforms in the procedures , training and supervision , and ordered the launch of a pilot program for the purpose of testing the cameras worn on the body in some areas , where the nejčastějšímu occurs , stopping people .
in august , the city of new york agreed to their methods of keeping names and addresses of the people whose cases were rejected after a police search .
oral grounds for appeal of the city is scheduled for sometime after 14 . march 2014 .
tactics for stopping and searching people denounced a series of civil rights defenders .
there is a certain form of stopping and searching people for about a decade , but the recorded tour under the administration of mayor michael bloomberg &apos;s independent dramatically increased to a record high number of 684 330 in 2011 , in most cases , the blacks and the cholos that were hanging .
in 2004 , wrote that the four men , who all belong to the minority , an action that became a class action case .
proponents of the changes program stopping and searching people conducted by the police department in ny claims that changes to end unfair practices , increase the credibility and efficiency of the police force and can affect how these procedures used by other police department .
opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale , but not a crime , and that this will be wasted money , but it will not resolve the wider problem , the police force is under pressure after the last decade reduced the numbers of a few thousand people .
the judge noted that hadn &apos;t ended practice stopping and searching of persons , which is constitutional , but has reformed the way tours in ny police department established .
cdc published by center for the school of the directive as regards allergies in children
in the middle of the center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) published a set of guidelines to help in the case of children &apos;s food allergy in school .
this is the first set of these directives , which the u.s. government has released , and it &apos;s due to the fact that the number of school-age children , who suffer from allergies to food , are rising .
one of the 20 children in the united states has an allergy to food .
center of the cdc revealed that the incidence of food allergies in children increased between 1997 and 2007 , about 18 percent .
the directive contain information for schools about how to inform staff and faculty about children &apos;s allergies to foods and how to an allergic reaction , if it occurs , to respond .
it also recommends that schools have available epinephrine – most commonly used auto injector epipen brand – to be capable of responding to a potentially life-threatening allergy .
the state legislature recently updated rules that schools allow you to store the adrenaline easier .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms emerging in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction .
the child may say : &quot; it &apos;s like someone jabbing tongue &quot; , &quot; i feel that i have hair on the tongue &quot; or &quot; language &quot; of me itches .
as the tipsport ( ) erases personal data .
more than a year ago , i made the tipsport.cz website to register .
i &apos;m here but subsequently did not finish because of the branch was just someone who couldn &apos;t complete the registration from the internet .
and because i didn &apos;t want to go to another branch , registration has plummeted , then i moved and i changed the address and number of the identity card .
when i wanted to complete your registration at a later date , i was told that it can &apos;t , because i have another id , address and that it simply is not complete , and i ask for the deletion of data and perform a new registration .
so i did and it 24.10.2013 i wrote to technical support that i ask for the deletion of all their personal data from the database according to the current law on personal data protection .
on duhý day i wrote that i have a technical support to complete your registration at the branch .
this began marathon e-mail technical support , where finally after 4. urganci 25.10. they wrote that personal data deleted at my request .
one would therefore have said that could make the new registration , and here again the problems began as soon as i wrote that my user name is already taken ( i understand has not been deleted-this is not a personal statement , but eventually retired and this ) .
so i used a different user name and jumped out at me that my personal data are already stored , to complete the registration at the branch ( as may have saved something to argue that clear ? ) , so i again contacted technical support .
to my question how it is possible to spoil me , that personal data is actually erased 25.10. and so i sent an email with that error .
this i did ( yesterday around 15 hours ) and on it wrote off me today that i have registered the same day ( 31.10.2013 ) in 13.21 and that , therefore , it is not because i used the same name and date of birth .
what about that technical support contact is already a week and i am having with them that it still isn &apos;t .
and what about that if it was true what they claim ( like not ) would not be able to register one with the same name or the same date of birth , if this is registered .
just by the way in those i actually registered 13.21 , on the same name and date of birth , but i used a fictional e-mail and phone number , and wonder of wonders , it appeared to me that the page was sent to me at the e-mail link to complete the registration .
how is it possible , when they cannot be registered under the same name and date of birth ?
probably because the tipsport binds the registration on the email and phone number and the date simply has not surrendered as they claim .
so i again said technical support simply lie ( either deliberately or they don &apos;t know what they write ) , because that what they write is true .
i have several screens that showed the problem with registration was before 31.10. so &quot; fake &quot; registrations on this simply has no effect .
to me the stark sentence-tipsport wrote back , i &apos;m sorry , but the fact that you &apos;ve already registered , we can &apos;t check again your claim .
and communication has ended .
repeat the same sentence over and over , respectively , that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth .
they can &apos;t even accept the fact that the registration has not been completed by clicking on the link in the email and then actually did not .
if i summarize it , then , that not only nevymazal the tipsport data as they claim , but still he &apos;s lying when he claims the opposite .
the worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and trying to make it appear that the bug is on the side of the customer .
by the way after putting this on my personal blog things a bit in motion and the technical support of e-mail transmitted to examine the matter and informed ( after a week of haggling and a reminder and warning to the same mistake ) .
killing us , but we &apos;re innocent , defends the khmer rouge leaders
nuon chea was the number two in the hierarchy of the khmer rouge khieu samphan and former head of the state .
during the reign of the khmer rouge , from 1975 to 1979 was based on a blend of maoism and of nationalism , robbed of life as a result of exhaustion , hunger , disease , torture and executions of more than three million cambodians , therefore , at least a quarter of the population .
this chief infamous prison s-21 , granted by the international criminal tribunal for cambodia in 2010 a life sentence in prison .
nuon chea and khieu samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity , including torture , enslavement , and murder .
nuon chea and khieu samphan has defended by saying that they believed that they act in the best interests of the nation and , what is the actual extent of the killing .
&quot; it is easy to say that everything i had to know everything understand and therefore intervene and rectify the situation , &quot; said khieu samphan on thursday before the court .
do you really think that i wanted this to happen to my people ?
the reality is that i didn &apos;t have any power , &quot; he added .
nuon chea said he never ordered a number of khmer rouge to &quot; people treated badly or is killed , allowed them to food or commit genocide . &quot;
but he admitted &quot; moral responsibility &quot; for the dead .
&quot; i would like to sincerely apologize to the public , the victims , their families , kambodžskému of all the people , &quot; he said .
pětapadesátiletá bin sivla , which for the khmer rouge regime lost 11 relatives , told afp that the agency cannot accept the apology of nuon chea . &quot;
&quot; he lied to us . &quot;
&quot; just wants to be acquitted . &quot;
&quot; does not care about the other , &quot; she said .
&quot; if he orders his underlings would be killed , &quot; she added , saying that the leaders of the khmer rouge are &quot; worse than the monsters &quot; .
the court was also &quot; foreign minister , &quot; ieng sary , the khmer rouge regime , but died in march of this year .
his wife ieng thirith , former social affairs minister , in september 2012 the court found to be incompetent in the process due to dementia .
khmer rouge leader pol pot died in 1998 .
fantastic ice cream , which glow in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has produced the first ice cream , which glow in the dark – the use of jellyfish .
charlie francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed light-emitting titbit .
the idea came when he read the professional discourse on a jellyfish , and convinced the scientists in china to chemically produced protein that causes the light .
this ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the ph level in the protein and subsequently causes her to radiation .
chris says that ice cream is lit when it reacts with the heat of your mouth , and therefore the more suck , the more clearly .
charlie , the founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; ( lick me taste great ) , says : &quot; it &apos;s amazing stuff , but in terms of production , we are at the beginning , so for 200 gbp you get about 2 g of the substance . &quot;
the protein , which we use in ice cream , it reacts with your language at neutral ph .
so how does your mouth heat increases the protein level of ph and the ice cream begins to shine .
we tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate halloween , because it causes this fantastic bright effect .
is probably the most expensive ice cream that i have ever made , because the luminous jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .
and so each scoop is about 140 gbp .
but it tastes great .
charlie &apos;s in experimental company based in bristol , is known for its unusual flavors of beer , cheese , beef and gold petals .
his other product but should be even more ambitious .
says : &quot; i really wanted to make an invisible ice cream . &quot;
in its essence it is impossible due to the refraction of light by ice crystals , ice cream , but i reckon with the fact that a way to do it , we can find .
ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish , artificially manufactured by the chinese scientists .

martin doctor about problems with oh in sochi : communications with the russians is a challenging
the corners of his mouth to indicate a slight smile and then just deep says : &quot; it &apos;s challenging . &quot;
cooperation with the organization of the olympic games in sochi 2014 team is a little more complicated , according to martin dr .
what was the last olympics , we can forget .
&quot; nothing works as well , &quot; says the head of the czech olympic mission .
what specifically is happening ?
a number of things works more slowly and not exactly .
it &apos;s kind of confusing .
from the standpoint of invoices are relatively fast , in terms of supplying information about the essential things not so much anymore .
from them for three months , to páčíme are supplied , as they will be officially marked in each village , so that we can do as a whole series of things .
we &apos;re still waiting , and they still say that the thing to communicate .
in a number of things still communicate with each other .
it is already at least finished the olympic village ?
but it &apos;s not a dire situation .
a month ago , we walked around the empty rooms .
fortunately , the houses stand .
what does it mean that they are empty ?
the finished floor ?
only the basic concrete , therefore , such was the status of a month ago .
but they still have time .
even if there is a risk that up to 26 there . january as the vanguard will come , there will still feel the glue .
and if nestíhali , it will be what ?
president putin , do you think there would be given army ?
exactly , so it probably would be .
it was not that the olympic village = potemkin village .
it is in danger of running out , for example , edit the paths , nedodělají details .
maybe they will have a path in such a state that we will have to take the boots from the london games .
but i believe that it somehow together .
how many czech athletes could go to sochi ?
now there are about 78 , although depending on the nomination criteria , this number changing .
should probably go in the figure skating trio , what &apos;s left .
about rychlobruslařce martin sáblíkové also nobody has doubt , but otherwise it is in development .
still waiting for you trip to sochi ?
no , if nothing happens , i should go there to 26 . january .
how will they look like houses in the olympic village , we know .
we even get yourself some things measured by metro , we did not believe only náčrtkům .
we are also a whole range of other things , including transport .
and what does the chief of the mission of one hundred days before the olympic games ?
preparing for the annual evaluation of individual olympic sports , plus i &apos;m doing the normal agenda within the meaning of the communication with the organising committee in sochi .
place the post-electoral sirloin post-election goulash
the october elections rather than the winner brought a bunch of losers .
it &apos;s not just the parties in the chamber of deputies or not ( eg . spoz ) , but also the previous government parties ( ods , top 09 ) and , eventually , the social democrats because of their internal divisions .
policymakers festive sirloin instead of naservírovali us on the weekend after the stew .
&quot; the election has become a movement of andrei babiš , which promised the voters to change the political style of governance .
the fragmentation of the election outcome and schism in the winning side of the loading of the political ( from ) will mr. president milos zeman , regardless of the wishes of the voters who the party which the president publicly supported zeman , nor did the chamber of deputies .
the president is due to unpleasant events lost ahead of other strategic policy , but there are still a few ways to get it back-for example , by selecting a future prime minister .
while the social democrats had chance to obtain the premiership in my eyes away , entrepreneurs , babišovi andreju .
post-election developments , although not yet a mile away early and smooth to create a stable government , but compared with the pre-election scenario the government supported by the communists , the left-wing social democrats , this is development for business in the czech republic and therefore the economy had better news .
due to the loud opposition so put together with the ods and top 09 , is still the most probable variant of the coalition of the social democrats , and christian democrats ( a total of 111 members ) .
due to the split in the social democrats , which will thus become unreadable and weak ground in negotiations , the result may be quite daunting for the coalition negotiations .
a minority government , the social democrats made up with &quot; nezemanovců &quot; on the castle probably does not pass .
in addition , any government , to which the social democrats will participate , will be vulnerable to unmet aspirations of many of the social democrats , which may lead sooner or later to a further split in the party .
therefore , i ask myself : &quot; nespějeme by gravity to the other early elections ? &quot;
the other choice would have been rather a referendum on the mandate of the voting strength of the movement .
the social democrats on the implementation of the sectoral plans , taxes , more tax increases of income or the state bank building fell hopefully under the table .
the cssd , kdu-csl , and dawn agree , for example , on the contrary , the promotion of entrepreneurship , moderate fiscal policy ( government deficit below 3 % of gdp ) , on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons , reducing the lower rate of vat for the selected item .
the friction surface , most occur in the perspective of social policy and the size of the state .
yes , but now has the upper hand , so the program so far , the most likely coalition yes , the cssd , kdu-csl , leaning more to the right .
which from my perspective is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving .
until recently , it seemed that the majority of citizens in the czech republic was early elections .
as reasons were cited corruption , wasting money on overpriced purchases and state contracts , tax increases , and last but not least , government scandals .
according to the results of elections , you can infer that most of the citizens of this state .
it actually didn &apos;t matter and that there was a status ( pilferage and indebtedness of the state ) , were actually satisfied .
otherwise , you can &apos;t really explain , that 3 413 497 voters there to vote , the electorate voted top 357 596 09 384 174 voters voted for the ods and a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original coalition , which represents a 52,16 % of all legal voters .
which is an absolute majority .
when the above parties i &apos;ll tack 1 016 829 voters cssd , then to the old order ( because all the parties involved in the &quot; theft &quot; and the indebtedness of the state ) , then this state actually agreed 64,23 % legal voters .
this actually a majority of voters indicated that they are not for punishing culprits rozkradení and over-indebtedness of the state .
or you think that the members of the social democrats , who are on the endeavour participated in the relevant laws ?
we are at all help ?
olomouc opens in the historic center public ice skating rink

scientists more throw light on how the movements of the tail is connected with the mood of the dog
earlier research has shown that dogs wag a tail are more to the right ( from the perspective of a dog ) , while nervous dogs tail waving largely left .
now , however , scientists say that other dogs can do these subtle differences in the movement of the tail of the log and respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , pasko of the university of trento said : &quot; for the people , it is well known that the left and the right side of the brain have different binding to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions . &quot;
it &apos;s the same thing we tried to pick out other species .
he added that , as is the case with people , even in dogs is on the right side of the brain responsible for the left-hand motions and vice versa and that these two hemispheres are playing a different role in the emotions .
in an effort to get more information about how the dogs respond to asymmetrical wagging the tail of the other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals watched movies about other dogs .
measured heart rate of these animals and have analyzed their behavior .
will probably not be long before we understand why it is their tail , sometimes on one side , and sometimes on the other .
professor vallortigara said : &quot; we have dogs , movies about dogs – whether in the natural version , or in the form of silhouettes – to get rid of any confounding stimuli , and we were able to also adjust the movement of the tail and show him more right or left . &quot;
when the animals saw the otherwise bland dog move his tail to the right ( from the perspective of a dog &apos;s tail , vrtějícího ) , remained perfectly calm .
but when shooting noticed the tail mostly left ( again from the perspective of a dog &apos;s tail , vrtějícího ) , their heart rate increased and the animals , she said .
professor vallortigara said he doesn &apos;t think that the dogs through these movements consciously interacted with each other .
rather believes that the dogs have learned from experience that moves you must and does not need to be careful .
he said : &quot; if you meet several times with dogs and move their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to the rather friendly behavior and move right engenders less friendly behavior , you respond on the basis of this experience . &quot;
the researchers say that the findings may be the owners of the dogs , veterinarians , and cvičitelům to help better understand the emotions of their animals .
dog behavior expert john bradshaw , lecturer at the university of bristol , beasts of burden , he said , that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side for dogs .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln , found that the dogs turned his head to the left when watching an aggressive dog , and on the right , when you look at the happy dog .
and in another professional treatises from the university of victoria in canada , said : &quot; the dog robot dogs more likely to be present when shaking his tail to the left than to the right , when it became rather uncertain — exactly the opposite of the italian study . &quot;
the difference may be , according to him due to the fact that the dogs in these various studies of animals in the movies or canine robots exactly quite as dogs .
he explained that could help the study of how the dogs react to real dogs .
&quot; although in the case of many different mammals , there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details are still to be clarified , and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
but given how simple it is to record their behavior will probably not be long before we understand why it is their tail , sometimes on one side , and sometimes on the other .
rbs suspended two traders with foreign currency
according to two people familiar with the situation , the royal bank of scotland , disperse ( rbs ) , two traders in their division with a foreign currency , which is another indication that the global investigation enforcement authorities concerning suspected machinations with the currency market is becoming more frequent .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that shall cooperate with the competent authorities in the investigations of the largest financial market in the world , where every day changes the owner of the $ 5.3 trillion .
these two traders were first suspended in rbs employees under the expanding investigation , which is a response to the scandal with the handling rate of libor ( london interbank offered rate ) .
the bank refused to comment on the suspension , but confirmed that this month has received a request for information from the authorities .
&quot; our ceaseless quest continues in this matter and we fully cooperate with the fca and our other institutions , &quot; said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , the people who are close to this event , said that british financial authority handed over rbs behavior records of e-mails and instant messages sent from accounts and the accounts of the former trader .
this trader , richard usher , left rbs in 2010 and it is expected that has been released from his current position of european president of foreign currency trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , european president of trading for cash in citi , took a vacation this week , while matt gardiner , a former head of trade currencies at barclays and ubs , was suspended this week by standard chartered .
neither of these traders has not been accused of any offense .
mr usher in the group instant messaging were bankers from barclays and citigroup , the people told the dedication to this event .
bank ubs this week expressed that after the swiss supervisory authority finma announced that it was investigating suspicious machinations on the market for foreign currency in several swiss banks , has taken steps against some of its staff .
at least six offices worldwide – european commission , finma , the swiss antitrust authority weko , fca , the ministry of justice in the united states and the monetary authority in hong kong – examines the claim that these bankers have teamed up to moving with the monetary market .
people familiar with the situation said that hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse , have triggered an internal investigation , or from the competent authorities have received a request for information .
banks are years old im and emails to find cases of some offences .
reports on investigations in the field , sudden traders which was one of the largest engines for creating profit statements of investment banks in recent years , but which has been undermined by the fact that a small currency volatility limiting the opportunity for speculators .
some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation , when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is basically impossible to manipulate , but senior marketers say it is not necessarily true .
a senior trader said that , despite the considerable volume of daily trading with foreign currency liquidity between different trade dismemberment of platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that &quot; you can begin to have an effect on the market at relatively low prices . &quot;
the news came on the same day , when the company announced that credit suisse this week release from his department for trading stocks trader , which late last year caused the loss of almost us $ 6 million .
the bank immediately drew the attention of the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities .
&quot; we are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved , &quot; the company said credit suisse .
the government was negotiating with klaus and Špidla .
now , the christian democratic union jana juan k sent against the babišovi .
the christian democratic union won in the election of fourteen members , therefore , only a third of the number of representatives of the social democrats , or yes .

the social democrats even andrej babiš a matador on their side .
i think it will be this time to commemorate the first negotiations in 1992 , when ods was also a completely new page .
&quot; the experience has been only the minimum , &quot; estimated kasal , how will this year &apos;s talks evolve .

sleep : i want the contract in the nhl .
juice , lust and passion i still have
for sleep has always been in the first place , because her family wants in its 38 years to the fullest .
either gets a job overseas and extend careers , or with the ice finally comes to an end .
&quot; i want to fulfill the role of a dad and a husband . &quot;
&quot; very much looking forward to it , &quot; says ice hockey player , who was still waiting in vain for the offer .
despite the fact that it &apos;s famous workhorse that never neošidí .
despite the fact that on the ice every time you leave the heart and can pull even by teammates .
and also , despite the fact that he was the most productive player of the season in the past columbus .
&quot; but the desire to show everyone &apos;s still in me , &quot; says firmly .
maybe , it is supposedly the new york rangers , which stalled entry into the season , and have wounded two-attackers rick nash and ryan callahan .
how do your joining rangers look like ?
it &apos;s just speculation .
until i have something on paper , so it does not have the price of the deal .
i know that an article in the journal , the new york post , that i would have had to sign , but that &apos;s all .
nowhere was delivered , that this really happened .
unfortunately , he himself would like to announced that a treaty , but it just isn &apos;t so .
nor will we haven &apos;t heard anything from the club ?
such communication in the nhl is taking place every day .
there it &apos;s about to get into a situation where the contract really comes down .
when you hurt a player or team is it is not anyone and ever .
there is a lot of different factors that must come together to make the contract .
but in new york city was similar circumstances occur , no ?
hurt is rick nash with ryan callahan and the team failed entry into the season , so there &apos;s a chance is , don &apos;t you think ?
of course , the chance is always there .
the second thing is that it always need two parties .
today i took a lot of offers , but so far i have no .
this is unfortunately the reality in which i live .
on friday , you are bound to america , are you in the expectation that something just might work out just right ?
i have the expectations of 5. in july , when the nhl opened the market with free players , and still nothing .
going to new york to be reminded ?
certainly not , i am going to tampa for the kids and for my wife .
i look forward to the sun and to see you again .
somehow you have scheduled your program ?
one is the fact that i &apos;m a father and a husband , and everything unfolds .
at the moment , i &apos;m not a hockey player-i have a contract and i don &apos;t play games .
so i &apos;m going to fulfill the role of dad and husband and i &apos;m looking forward to it .
already on sunday , mubarak has two hockey games , it is for me and my entire family holiday , when we can go to support our children in what they want to do .
are you thinking that you could do this in quotation marks on a full-time basis ?
clearly , a person can think about a lot of things .
this can occur .
i have tried it three years ago , when i missed 50 games because of knee surgery .
and the power and too me it was fun .
once it gets to such a stage that all goals , victory and passes you will not replace what you have at home .
because of the family and children , that is the meaning of life .
whether you got the job , what you want .
i had a job , that it was the most beautiful thing to me , in addition to the family could meet .
you had a lot of offers from europe : do you have it so you want to play in the nhl only because it &apos;s the nhl , or is it because of the family that you want to be in america ?
since i &apos;m a hockey player , so in the first place-in addition to the family – including sports success .
the nhl is the best competition in the world .
and it also depends on family life .
my children , therefore , sorry , our children-my and my wife-grew up in the states , began to go to school and so on .
and we would be very happy if this trend continued .
because what we tell ourselves , in america , the options are entirely elsewhere .
the chance we have to offer .
therefore , you are planning to stay in america permanently ?
we &apos;re going to practice like now .
this means that in the summer we &apos;ll be deep in the czech republic and in the surroundings of České budějovice .
and in the winter in tampa , or where it will take us our steps .
it is completely perfect , still be warm .
i &apos;ve had great fortune in life .
you could say that i went , it was a lot of manpower and renunciation and took me a lot of things that i missed .
but in return , he offered me a hockey a lot of options , and this is one of them .
that &apos;s a woman we can choose where we live .
a lot of people in the world who thirst after this , so that they can choose what they will do and how they live .
how long you will be in my age will dig , train hard and wait for an offer ?
yeah , so this is the question that i can &apos;t answer .
today i still have it in the juice , the lust , passion , passion for the sport . here the desire and motivation to prove to people that you &apos;ve still got to the nhl , i &apos;m still better than anyone else .
but i can &apos;t tell you how long it will stay there .
it does not go to plan .
so we can say that this season , wait , how it develops , and then decide what to do next ?
i &apos;m at the stage where i &apos;m going from day to day .
distant planets , black and white movies , or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that would be american jazz saxophonist wayne shorter was a pitcher .

dispenses with czech television sometimes without signing the action ?

in the past handed down affect such rath or jaroslav tvrdík &apos;s record no one as follows nezdokumentoval , let alone under the signed it .
true leadership for sticking up for the editors .
however , the cases described do not give the answer to the question , where such affection of some journalists to zemanovcům takes-whether it is a response to a direct order , or to use , a typical manifestation of vulgarism inappropriate empathic friendliness .
and if we assume a general prohnilost , you cannot resist the question whether a change in television do not seek other equally unscrupulous power interests , which has yet to get an opportunity .
the truth to those who say that in developed countries , to the application for intervention to the politicians .
but it is also true that this does not mean that there would be complaints about public media did not exist .

i &apos;m sure that fenton helped adorable clothes really fit in there with him .
snowden is willing to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany in connection with monitoring on the part of the u.s .
edward snowden , a snitch from the american intelligence services , has announced that he is willing to go to berlin , the german parliament passed the evidence if the american national security agency and its director keith alexander will not be able to provide answers to questions about its activities .
german parliamentarian hans-christian sträbele on thursday met with mr. snowdenem in russia , where he was granted asylum , and acted with him about the possibility of testifying in germany .
in a letter from mr. snowdena , a member of the forward to the media on friday in berlin , stated : &quot; although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive , the government will continue to be the opposition behaves as if to zběhům and trying to criminalize political speeches serious actions which do not give space for defence . &quot;
to speak the truth , however , is not a crime .
in this letter mr. snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could convince the united states government to withdraw criminal charges brought against him .
the charges the ministry of justice of the united states include espionage and the theft of state assets .
hans-peter friedrich , the german interior minister , said for the magazine zeit online : &quot; if mr. snowden is ready to talk with german officials to find a way to allow it . &quot;
the tension in the relationship between the united states and germany began to soar , though , appeared to claim that the nsa eavesdropped on phone chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , a member of parliament , who leads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news , said that if it was any opportunity to hear mr snowdena as a witness , &quot; without that risk and that would completely destroy the relations with the us &quot; , it should do so .
mr sträbele , member of parliament for the german green party , posted on its twitterovém post a picture , that is with mr. snowdenem .

if mr. snowden testified in germany , he would need assurances that there will be &quot; safe &quot; , said a member of parliament .
mr snowden said in his letter that he faced harsh and relentless campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave the home .
he said , however , that the reaction around the world to &quot; an act of political expression , &quot; he added .
citizens around and senior officials--including those in the united states--consider the detection system for monitoring of the omnipresent not reasonable service to the public .
the letter includes an offer to cooperate with german authorities , &quot; to the hardships that the humanitarian situation will be resolved . &quot;
to three hate
writer václav kahuda , after twelve years he returned to writing .
after long years when he read , he lived , but did not write , vÁclav kahuda ( 1965 ) new novel , dark presence .
that will not be a slim volume , suggests the number of parties to comparable to its most famous work of the thicket ( petrov , 2001 ) .
for the salon kahudu , confessed another significant czech writer-emil dan h .
what moved you after twelve years of silence , wrote the novel ?
i made it to three with hatred .
see around you is still new , and new clones of the human folly of pettiness , young organisms affected blind selfish endeavors .
about us , not the faces of older zruinované helpless lust , vekslácké soul and vice versa přepólovaní ideologues , who are struggling with a small counter whores sell their &quot; product &quot; .
at the beginning of the millennium , i bought a small digital camera and filmed his jurodivé friends , weirdos and hidden services .
it passed .
sometimes i feel , how my life on this planet is the brain .
i prefer to walk and then an evening at reading reading books .
you &apos;re talking about frustration , hatred .
he was somewhere in the past , some kind of fault , which has influenced you , or just getting old too , like all of us ?
a turning point occurred a long time ago , roughly ten years .
if it had a name .
well , and after that i lived .
there is somewhere inside but i &apos;m still surprised the silent boy .
see more orphaned cvikýře , each in its tornado anxiety .
saved me writing books .
i attend this giant of the movement , thousands of years of life on this planet-born incomprehensible future .
the enormous , breathtaking complexity of life , where every stone is the direct heir of our presence .
we are sad and beautiful games players , when the path of trial and error is the next and the next generation of beings , which in biliónech interactions per second creates some superhuman , artificial intelligence .
twelve years is a relatively long time .
perceive your writing as a continuous process , or you started from scratch ?
soliloquy , or rather dialogue that lead right and left halves of the brain , sometimes floating on the surface and then in a book .
as a period of peace are riddled with quietly sleeping metastases wars that may one day wake up-so the book has 12 years of silence is dressed into words .
i felt how i mute the avalanche of life grows in the brain , and if you do anything , so i quietly one day rush .
it &apos;s a set of questions , which formulated the brain and it is layers , which are stored in the darkness &quot; below the surface of consciousness &quot; .
neokortex , grey bark brain , asks the older evolutionary services goes to the ancient letokruhům of the brain tree .
talking to srstnatým predators , serpents , he asks , looking for the answer in the flight of birds , raising his eyes to the clouds in the sky .
yes , the moral law within me , and the starry sky above me .
eventually the brain asks the world .
relatively often you express yourself to the ego , metaphorically-could you define him biologically ?
the brain stores its billions of connections and bindings of all memories of the electrochemical , experience , and experiences that the person lived .
this les logically and emotionally exposed and větvících are trees information , registers memory , used by the brain , in its resolution , cognitive process , being exposed to the constantly fluctuating presence , in a constant effort to try to name and understand their surroundings and decode important communication .
sometimes the fault arise from overload .
by analogy-like you &quot; fell &quot; pc emulator from the speech and the compilers of the foreign languages you &apos;d wind up first in the operating environment , such as windows , and after several unsuccessful restartech ended up in the deep green flickery screens the bios in the system that controls the basic functions of and collaboration on your motherboard , cpu and ram , etc .
for those who have not yet understood what is speech-i &apos;m talking about spiritual crisis .
you &apos;ve been talking about her often-why are you just interested in this type of regresu on a regular basis ?
because it is the pit .
in so far the functional mechanisms of our thinking , feeling , and behavior-the wedge appears .
here is a good quote nietzsche : &quot; so long staring into the abyss , and the abyss looked up to him . &quot;
pure feeling-that a person is lost if all hope disappears , mentally &quot; dies &quot; and plays as a new quality .
and why do i care ?
i &apos;ll answer a parable .
once one has fallen into the pool and drowned , run days , months and years , he said , and read , and those books have taught him to swim-live .
he became a &quot; diver &quot; .
i hope someone will help me a written sentence , as once helped the hrabal lyrics to me .
to what extent do you think the readers on a particular person , that your text will be read ?
the one for which you cannot say anything meaningful , some call it knowing the next super ego , according to me , but the best characterization of arthur rimbaud , in a letter to a friend :
&quot; i is someone else-that the reader participates directly in the process of formulation of words and sentences . &quot;
from early youth to read books of old czech fairy tales , sailed with captain nemo &apos;s submarine , ran in the dark alleys after stínadlech .
eventually , all this branching of the authors and their message is : &quot; the sun bright worlds other karel hynek mácha . &quot;
and when the book is out ?
it depends on čtenářově opinion ?
on the reverse reflection of that you over the people , what book to read , it gets ?
of course i care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read the five hundred pages of text .
and even then , after years on the street accidentally contact and thank me that i helped them with some of their difficult life decision .
the books are in fact &quot; lives &quot; or rather &quot; worlds &quot; .
are encoded into characters , letters , bear the experience , the history of the regions of the tongue .
whenever we can wake up to life if we let their sentences flow into the brain .
it &apos;s actually , in a way , something forbidden to swap shifts divine-to wake up more and more life stories , small universes and temporary of the planet .
it is a fact , whose dna is stored in line according to the ancient démonologických books make witchcraft .
after the release of the book you-as it is-is a chain of readings .
i remember you once read like .
vrhneš it again with joy , or you feel after years of otherwise ?
now i &apos;d rather just tell it .
and what i found out ?
good smart people live everywhere .
their basic character-they are fine , too , they are on a friendly vyzařovaní , don &apos;t you feel lonely with them .
i &apos;ll give an example-in the town of Červený kostelec lived was ( and i hope she &apos;s still alive ) one curly bookseller ( aptly called robin ) , a hilarious partner and good girls &apos; bull .
when one individual articles presented me pijatyce strings the readers of my book the thicket .
i looked them in the eye and then i was shown rozdrbaný , očtený copy of my book .
i put in a quandary just reading jitrnici and shortly a masculine wept .
in silence we all stood there , swaying and with emotion , sounding drunken slzeli .
then the young blond mixed with the roar and jumped headfirst from the window into the snow .
it was on the ground floor .
we ran out into the night and arrested a happy citlivců , rabid aching souls czechs playing and depression of remote patriots-howling and hýkali how werewolves until the morning .
each of your book is formally and substantively different than the previous ones .
this is also true for the text of the wind , darkness , the presence of ?
it &apos;s storytelling .
it is the tale of one country for nine rivers and nine mountains .
ivan bunin in his amendment is inserted into the mouth suchodol folk healers words of one old russian myth : on the sea , on the ocean , on the island of bujanu .
it is psice , the gray box .
horror , terror , mystery .
it never happened , but all of it from somewhere .
maybe once upon a time we were the devils in hell and drew lots-what role we play in this country .
are you going to continue to write , or to let it again on the free flow of inspiration ?
the answers are eternal-otokar březina .
writing is a wonderful way to dialogue .
something huge and seashell , similar to the movement of the continents on the planet , influences our choice of such depth and breadth in such that it completely beyond our horizon-so self-evident we do exactly along the lines of your program .
we rewarded the influx of dopamine , endorphins and other mixtures of substances .
we are biological machines .
we want to mate , dying in defence and getting new personal territories .
occasionally the disorder and vyzáříme compassion .
only if we have the right to call people .
this is the answer to your question-a biological robot is already full of different disorders , is located on the shore of the ocean unconscious and into the leaky tarps made from dirty handkerchief to catch tides rush of wind .
i have to write , so i could be the man .
schools should focus more on math , spelling and grammar
when the hours will be required to study english literature at least one shakespeare play , novel of the 19th century. century , romantic poetry and contemporary british fiction since 1914 .
the test will also include &quot; hidden text &quot; that is motivated to a deeper reading ;
combined courses in english literature and language will be deleted .
by 2015 will require that students had a graduation exam from language , and will be encouraged to choose english literature as an optional subject .
the ministry of education should issue a new outline tomorrow for english and mathematics – the first objects that have to go through a radical change .
for other essential items , the changes are waiting for next year .
in a separate step , ofqual , the office , which oversees the graduation tests will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exams , and this , together with the new system of markings and a smaller volume of projects for students .
in his speech in the summer , education minister michael gove said that there is &quot; a broad consensus , as regards whether or not we need to reform our examination system , in order to regain the confidence of society &quot; and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation exam was &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more stringent &quot; .
the study shows that the english school dedicated less time to mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week--than most of the other countries .
for a comparison of the school in australia dedicated to mathematics , an average of 143 hours per year and in singapore about 138 .
although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics , coalition sources indicated that a comprehensive examination of mathematics--along with a greater emphasis on this subject in result rankings — are likely to encourage schools to provide teaching .
the learning plan will focus more on &quot; the problems of the real world , &quot; including financial mathematics .
the mayor of ostrava kajnar : cancer in the cssd is not me
before the election , with fully sprung into long-simmering dispute between the two wings of the fighting for influence in ostrava .
all this culminated when the mayor of ostrava petr kajnar turned on the court due to the undemocratic and compiling lists .
actors cases to yet they too express to the party before the election to avoid even more .
but now votes are tallied .
the leadership of the social democrats immediately in ostrava monday evening called on the mayor of ostrava that he stepped out of the party , and will probably push even to lose its function .
petr kajnar but wants to fight on .
what &apos;s in dispute and who is on whose side , described in an exclusive interview for the journal .
how do you perceive the outcome of elections ?
the social democrats will surely provide a much better result .
it is detrimental to us , that before the election address in the media disputes inside the party ?
i can imagine that the social democrats could have a better election result .
but on the other hand , it corresponds to the condition in which the social democrats is now .
it &apos;s a party that has its own internal problems , is ill , and people perceive that it is not all right .
in the election that gave clear .
what are the internal diseases of the cssd ?
the decline for some time , according to me , passes through the cdp and similar things are now unfortunately take place in social democracy .
this is so that the lobbyists , influential people , who previously had expected that their prebendy will find the ods , moved to the people in the social democrats and have influence on them .
then it &apos;s related to the fact that the offices of the city of ostrava is the police and collects computer .
it shows that the social democrats is not composed only from people who would like to the good of all the others , but many of them primarily on the good .
the cssd is divided into two irreconcilable camps in prague , as seen in the current struggle for power between haškovci and sobotkovci .
but that was a long time .
that &apos;s what happened before the election in ostrava , was just a precursor of what is happening now in prague .
haskovo wing gradually stagings it casted &apos;s position , then this may lead to the situation after the elections , which will weaken the sobotkovo wing .
the man is in the policy in a situation where sometimes must access the compromises .
everyone has an internal border , when those compromises do not , and this is my case .
originally , i didn &apos;t want to run into the house , but when i saw the whole thing inside the party , so i agreed with luboš zaorálkem , that i will try to get on the regional list for me as mayor of ostrava has just sobotkovo the wing .
haskovo wing but could stop .
why you &apos;re standing on the side of bohuslav sobotka , and michal hasek ?
marcia sobotka is a man who always speaks mainly about the social democrats and to a certain extent and the visions for the party and for the country .
i admit that from the other side , i haven &apos;t heard anything like that .
michal hašek just fights for power .
i don &apos;t understand , how can the bureau , which is lower than the central authority of the executive committee , to start just dismiss the chairman of the party .
it is a struggle for power , regardless of everything , and the statute of the party .
according to me , as now demonstrated in prague , michal hašek , ended his political career .
how do you perceive that you lead the social democrats on the list of ostrava did not approve .
political parties are based on the competition , who are both from the place of their members .
the competition should be largely based on the programming and the ability of those people to fulfill the vision .
of course , in this contest , even people who do not have much ability or vision , but a political party is for them a lift to the money , which should be elsewhere .
the problem is when these people begin to receive to the forefront due to the fact that unscrupulous breaking the rules violate the statutes of the party .
its practices of the political parties of the mafia and so violate the laws of the czech republic .
to draw attention to this issue is more important to me than that , to take into account whether it has some some political future kajnar .
it is important that the parties began to respect the statutes .
therefore , you are handed a proposal even before the elections to the court on the preliminary injunction against the form of the list of social democrats in the moravian-silesian region ?
the current district executive committee of social democrats in their power strengthens the fact that organizations that do not comply with him , he can cancel the assigned based new organization , gradually throwing inconvenient members of the party .
an example is the need and that it wanted to exclude bednaříka from club officials to richard , but he filed suit against it and they then resolution about its exclusion rather than canceled .
it shows that compliance with the statutes of the party to pursue through the courts , although the last option , but at the moment those other ways and control bodies within the social democrats stopped working , it is the only option .
in an effort to lead the social democrats , led by new knesset adam rykalou is the appeal from the position of the mayor .
it is a public secret that this post has to take the mayor faces lumír palyza .
it is so , adam ram and lumír palyza trying to do everything they could to get me off .
they promise people the position , gaining votes and those votes then solidifies his power in the party .
when i go back into the past , so everything that happened to be around the football club baník ostrava bazaly stadium , and the purchase was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me .
it was artificially staged to mark me as a person who gives money to where it does not belong .
while the city bought the property , which has strategically for him a great value .
how do you keep your remaining in the function of the mayor ?
the district committee to me and yet more people on monday urged us to consider your continuance in the cssd .
but i think that this is so , such as when the thief shouting : stop thief !
when we look at the results of my work for the past eleven years , so i don &apos;t see anyone in the ostrava social democracy , who initiated and pushed through , sometimes even against members of the party , the emergence of so many things , such as the development of industrial zones and the extension of the science and technology park .
yet all become uncomfortable .
i don &apos;t read it differently than the way others piled on the points , after which he desires .
you against these efforts , yet somehow fight ?
because if this republic work well , so must work well , as well as political parties .
i can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state , if he can &apos;t even drive itself .
therefore , the possibility that i &apos;m now retired from the social democrats , because i think that the one who causes cancer of this party , not me , but these people who are trying to drive me .
we want to show that he can still win , pilsen promises rajtoral
it &apos;s a bit of a paradox .
while his team above all profit and loss account lately , a defender or a midfielder victoria plzeň františek rajtoral has the form that earned him a return to the team after a year .
he is even střelecky , is full of activity , after the procedure was ordered in teplice in the match penalty kick .
viktoria stretched in the last two rounds against slavia and after victory in teplice , but at the end of these two duels taking a single point .

defend academic freedom , this applies to zemana and ods .
i have in recent months repeatedly called for open letters to students , educators , and the leadership of middle and high schools in several regions to defend academic freedom before the electoral campaign , which was conducted by the school president milos zeman .
i met with greater or lesser success .
the rector of masaryk university in brno who refused to give a lecture spoz-honorary chairman of the zemanovci in the run-up , it even received a response in the form of nepozvání to celebrate the national holiday in the czech republic .
here is a list of the schools , who already were brave and milos zeman to visit : technical university in brno , hladnov grammar school in ostrava , college of business , the business academy in cologne , university of j.e. purkyně in Ústí nad labem .
now in pardubice with the continuation of the enforcement policy on high schools .
the newly elected deputy for the civic democratic party , the dean of the faculty of electrical engineering and informatics , university of pardubice , simeon karamazov , refuses to withdraw from their academic functions , and moreover , it seems normal .
sir , it is not really the same thing as if you stayed , for example , in the function of the mayor of a small town .
do you want to include the regional presidents of the social democrats , who are working at the same time the function of deputy governor , and just as they degrade both professions ?
the people say that can handle both of these challenging features of left back .
i know , we have here an example michal hasek , who manages to even tens of functions at once .
but it &apos;s probably not exactly the example of the person that you should follow .
we find the opposite , and a positive example . Štěpánky fraňkové , who prefer to leave the seat post to fully attend to the leadership of the city of pardubice .
the main reason of my recommendation to leave the function of dean , however , is that an accumulation of functions you break apolitičnost academic soil , university of pardubice .
management of ods sees your current action on both positions as an advantage for the university .
&quot; his &quot; school , however , you will be able to help you without the dean .
i think that a similar opinion as am i and rector of miroslav ludwig will have your students .
consider even its withdrawal and keep the face .
otherwise , you may find that you &apos;re the voters at the next election are counted .
and it may not be of long duration .

the united states have gone in spying at times &quot; too far &quot; , said according to the agency &apos;s chief of american diplomacy afp john kerry during a video conference between washington and london .

&quot; the first returns from washington , &quot; according to afp came amid sharp controversy on both sides of the atlantic due to the scandalous revelations about bulk data tracking the american national security agency ( nsa ) , whose targets were u.s. allies .
&quot; in some cases , i admit , as well as the president ( barack obama ) , some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that it doesn &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; said kerry .
in an interview , but defended the practice .
collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and prevent assaults such as the 9 / 11 attacks . september 2001 in the united states , the bombings in madrid in march 2004 and in london in july 2005 .
&quot; we stopped the aircraft fell , the building exploded and people were murdered , because we were able to be timely informed of the úkladech , &quot; said kerry .
again , however , he admitted that the collection of information &quot; in some cases , went disproportionately away . &quot;
the affair around the american intelligence agency , which allegedly followed the hundreds of millions of phone calls , erupted in europe this month .
among other things , showed that americans watched and mobile phone german chancellor angela merkel .
european leaders are unclear about the outrage and some of them have called on the european union to try to reach an agreement with the united states , which would significantly restrict or monitor here .
the royal commission learned that before the lawsuits against jonathan lord were charged two employees of the christian association of young men ( ymca )
the royal commission for the sexual abuse of children learned that before was raised allegations against children &apos;s educators jonathan lord of the city of bristol in 2011 , two employees of a christian association ( ymca ) , young men in new south wales were prosecuting sexual abuse of children .
but that was before the commission in his opening statement to the commission , the association reported that in his organization never tackling a case of sexual abuse of a child .
executive director phillip hare was asked about the case , which was one of the employees of the ymca association charged with offences relating to child pornography , and on the other , when p.e. teacher in caringbah ymca associations in 1991 , was convicted of molesting children in their care .
mr hare said gaili furnessové , counselor of the commission that the first he knew about the case , but not on the second .
he admitted that the introductory statement of the association ymca was also inaccurate , stated that the organization is to carry out the external audits of the ymca , which awarded this organization as the leading proponent of the rights of children .
the evidence submitted by the commission talks about that the ymca was reminded that , in the audit of the ministry of education and the company from august this year received the second lowest of four possible ratings .
mr. hare , which began with the association of ymca work , when he was 21 , he confessed that the leadership from him alone down failed , when mr. lord has adopted , without evident whether it is staff aware of the obligation to report violations of the rules of safety for children .
earlier this year lord convicted of sexual harassing content through our 12 boys , committed during the two years when he worked at the ymca associations .
he was jailed for a minimum of six years .
mr. hare but rejected claims that the association of the ymca had a cultural problem , which the report said staff security breaches children mr. lord .
staff members have submitted evidence that witnessed such infringement , including that the lord was with children alone , privately , he is standing up for myself on his lap , he used to say that he likes , and he is playing with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwellová , who was lordovou the child and asked for training , safety of children , she worried because of his behavior , she testified that jacqui barnat , head of services for children in the ymca association in new zealand , who was a lordovým parent , was &quot; very intimidating , and often it was difficult to talk with him about something &quot; .
the director-general said that he does not accept the evidence of staff that they felt uneasy if they had contact with his superiors and the acts of the report .
instead , he said , that their friendship with lord clouded their judgment and , therefore , did not report the problem .
mr hare said that the council of the association of the ymca in new south wales said its view that the lesson of &quot; the case of jonathan lord &quot; for organization lies in the fact that the staff &quot; did not file any message &quot; , and the council agreed with him in it .
mr hare said that the decision to let the staff sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations emerged , made general manager for service children in the ymca organization liam whitleym .
he said that the aim was to avoid a distortion of the evidence , but was &quot; overly zealous &quot; and poorly made .
an expert on sexual abuse of children professor stephen smallbone of griffithovy university , told the commission that the ymca in new south wales was not from 2009 to 2011 , which would have been safe for children .
he said that there were serious problems in recruiting , screening , training , training and management of personnel .

in terms of fiscal policies of the state are significant leverage and multiplier effects , it is also one of the most important growth-enhancing measures .

faa : airline passengers can now use in aircraft technology gains ( but not to call from their mobile phones )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices &quot; from the gate to the gate &quot; – in addition to the call from their mobile phones--reading , playing games , watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated the new rules , which on thursday released a federal aviation administration ( faa ) .
the passengers but they do not expect that the changes occur immediately .
how quickly will be introduced will change according to the individual airlines vary , said faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
the airline will have to manage the faa demonstrate the extent to which their aircraft correspond to the new rules and that the updated training manual for cabin crew and the directive for the storage of equipment in order to comply with the new rules .
the faa said it has already received from certain airlines plans to extend the use of portable electronic devices in the aircraft .
among the companies that have already submitted plans are delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the status of such a plan , we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly , &quot; the faa said in a statement .
at present , passengers should be required to turn off its smart phones , tablets and other devices , as soon as they close the door of the aircraft .
cannot turn on , until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issued the permit .
from the passengers , it is expected that their device will be switched off again when the plane landed , drops and is not turned on , as long as the aircraft is on the ground .
under the new rules , airlines whose planes are properly protected against electronic jamming , allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off , landing and taxiing , the faa said .
since most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that has been modified so that passengers can use wifi at a higher altitude , it is expected that this meets the criteria .
laura gladingová , president of the professional association of cabin attendants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; as soon as the new rules will be introduced safely – and we do it with transport companies we work closely--it will be a success , &quot; she said in a statement gladingová .
we frankly tired of that look like &quot; watchmen . &quot;
however , surfing the internet , sending emails and sms or downloading data will continue to be under 3 km altitude is prohibited , said the agency .
passengers will be notified that their smart phones , tablets and other devices switched to the air mode .
so still no words with friends , online scrabble type game , played by actor alec baldwin on your smartphone in 2011 , when he was , as is well known , fired from aircraft , american airlines , because he refused to turn off your device when the aircraft was parked at the gate .
and heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of the fear that someone could get hurt if they were flying over the cabin .
calls from mobile phones will be on board , continue to be banned .
rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify the faa , but the u.s. federal committee for telecommunications .
the faa can for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing to repeal the ban .
last month , mark rosenker of the national committee for traffic safety , an expert on national security in the transport sector at cbs news , said that mobile phones will continue to be considered a risk .
&quot; mobile phones are really a problem , not only because it can potentially create interference with navigational instruments , but also of the fcc , we know that in the air can cause interference to radio towers , &quot; rosenker said .
business advisory committee created by the administration of the faa , therefore , to examine this issue , last month suggested that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices .
the faa has been pressured in recent years to mitigate the restrictions on their use .
critics such as senator claire mccaskillová , a democrat from missouri , contends that there is no legitimate safety reason for this prohibition .
restrictions are also more difficult to enforce , since the use of such devices is ubiquitous .
some studies suggest that up to a third of the passengers oblivious to the obligation to turn off your device , or it ignores .
the faa began restricting the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference with the navigation and communications equipment , when the passengers began to carry fm radio technical výdobytek at that time .
the new airline is much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the faa , that was resistant to electronic interference .
the airline already has for several years offered to passengers using wi-fi in the elevations .
plans prepared for wi-fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of airline companies would under the new rules should adapt to greater use of electronic equipment , said huertová .
current electronic devices generally emit far less intensive radio broadcast , than it was for previous generations of devices .
for example , an electronic reader when turning pages only the minimum broadcast .
but the broadcast is stronger when the device to download or send data .
among those who are pushing for it to release restrictions for the use of these devices by passengers , is amazon.com .
in 2011 , the representatives of this company &apos;s airliner loaded with its kindle electronic readers and made a test flight , but no problem .
members of the advisory committee , the faa expressed mixed feelings regarding whether these devices pose any risks .
douglas kidd from the national association of passengers of airlines said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee stated that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aircraft systems , and most of these messages is very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa require pilots to let passengers off equipment during instrument flying in low visibility .
group travel industry welcomed these changes and goes according to her about a reasonable procedure for the travelling public , that technology uses fully .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security , &quot; said roger dow , chief executive of the u.s. travel association .
in an unprecedented confession of john kerry , he said , that the american espionage &quot; gone too far &quot;
john kerry suggested the defence position of the us on the refinement of their monitoring programmes and in an unprecedented declaration said that in some cases , espionage , &quot; gone too far &quot; .
the foreign minister also admitted that , together with barack obama is responsible for that , with regard to the incendiary revelations about the spy activities of nsa , that appeared thanks to the informant edward snowdenovi , acted as &quot; autopilot &quot; .
the published information has fueled a diplomatic storm between the u.s. government and its allies .
mr. kerry via video-link on the open government conference in london , said : &quot; there is no doubt that the president and i and others in the government , we actually learned about some of the things that are happening , because of the inertia of the option was there , referring to the second world war , the difficult period of the cold war and then of course 11 . september . &quot;
he became thus the first high ranking member of the u.s. government , who admitted that the american espionage crossing the border , but stressed that it was not in breach of the law destroys
he said : &quot; in some cases , this has gone too far . &quot;
and the president is determined to try to explain it to people , and to clarify and now performs a thorough examination , that no one had the feeling that there was abuse .
i assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons .
mr. kerry , however , insisted that the nsa seeks the good of the organization and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we &apos;re dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up . &quot;
in the world there is radical extremism , which is firmly determined to kill and throw away the people up and attacking the government .
and what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens ?
in fact , we prevent falling aircraft , nevybuchly buildings and were not executed people , because we can already learn about these plans forward .
president of the senate subcommittee on european affairs , said on thursday that u.s. lawmakers are gearing up to europe to respond to concerns from abroad , which relate to the alleged american espionage , and convince the europeans that it is necessary to continue to combine forces in the fight against terrorism .
senator chris murphy of connecticut said that this week he spoke with members of the european parliament and of the other persons , and that they worried about their threats to stop participation in the counter-terrorism organizations , because they are rozčarováni by the national security agency ( nsa ) .
for the national-security interests of the united states is truly important that europe remained with us in the same boat , and that with regard to joint efforts in the fight against terrorism , said in an interview from washington , murphy , a member of the democratic party and president of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on european affairs .
and i &apos;m in europe , i made it clear that we need to continue cooperation in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the nsa programs .
media reports that the nsa collected millions of phone records in europe , undermined relations with some american allies , although the head of the agency this week said they were inaccurate and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata , which the nato allies collected and shared with the united states ,
more revelations cited documents disclosed as part of snowdenem , the nsa monitored mobile phone german chancellor angela merkel and other world leaders to 34 .
the director of national intelligence james clapper spying the allies defended as necessary and said that this is normal on both sides of the matter .

he said that the program is still in the works .
although murphy said that the aim of the trip is to help mend relations , adding that they will be ready , as well as &quot; well intentioned educational measures &quot; .
he said that european leaders must be to his own people honest when it comes to spy programs that use themselves for years .
&quot; while we adjust their monitoring programmes , in order to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also recognize the fact that we are not the only ones who performs espionage , &quot; said murphy .
meanwhile , mr. kerry goes according to plan this weekend to the middle east and to poland , to respond to hostility , has already raised the american strategy in syria , egypt and iran , and also an american surveillance activity .
the words &quot; mugabe is lame ass &quot; there is no prison , the court annulled the law

apart from that , mugabe reigns the country hard hands for more than 33 years , adopted in march zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum a new constitution with wider civil liberties .
small steps away from the dictatorship of one man the country joined in 2009 , when the agreement between the mugabem and the opposition brought into the premiership of morgan tsvangiraje .
however , the country continues to be troubled by the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world , which exceeded 100,000 percent .

the bailout package worth 325 million dollars for the tasmanian health
the federal government insists that a rescue package worth 325 million dollars for the moribund health in tasmania include the harsh conditions , which will ensure that the state government nepromrhá funds .
the federal minister of health tanya pliberseková announced that the australian union makes &quot; fast track &quot; measures to avert the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island , a greater number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders .
funding for a period of four years was decided after the government consultations with independent member andrew tasmánským wilkiem .
&quot; the government came up with an emergency rescue package , which , as we believe , solves specific problems , which the state is facing , &quot; said mrs pliberseková .
the $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million on operations at the request of the patient .
other operations , including orthopedic operations , 2600 and cataract operations will help eliminate debt .
the money is also freely accessible clinics in hobart and launcestonu , better postoperative care , training of medical specialists , mental health services and putting the personal medical records of the electronic systems in the local hospitals .
&quot; these investments respond to the thoughts that give me the front clinicians said that the best way to help tasmánskému the medical system , &quot; said mrs pliberseková .
the minister stressed that the tasmanian government must require a strict regime of reporting and record-keeping obligations .
the state will have to maintain the current level of funding , the money received to the commonwealth , and monthly inform where additional funds were spent .
the three-man committee will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible .
mr wilkie said today that 325 million dollars will be useless , &quot; until real reform to follow for the purpose of laying the basis for a more sustainable tasmánského public health system &quot; .
still , he praised the government for a response to its request for an urgent aid , which for the first time raised during negotiations with the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i believe that the federal support package can extricate the state from a critical state of the public health , &quot; said mr. wilkie .
according to the state government , the following additional selected procedures significantly reverse recent cuts .
a spokesman for the federal opposition in the area of health peter dutton believes that today &apos;s statement is only a &quot; band-aid &quot; .
&quot; the reason why i am here is that the labor government is excluded from our health care system 430 million dollars , &quot; he said on abc tv .
you can &apos;t have a state government that removes almost half a billion dollars , and the commonwealth , who pays $ 300 million , and to pretend that it is a good report .
mr. dutton called mrs. plibersekovou , to ensure that not one dollar from the rescue package will not be issued to the higher bureaucracy .

looking for fast replacement of ivan housing for himself and his elderly mother by then .
from the famous got a tip on the apartment 3 + kk apartment in an older house on the opposite side of prague .
&quot; at first it was a shock , but the view from the fourth floor to a large wooded park , and to me , on the other hand was inspirational , &quot; says ivana on first impression .
at first i thought that it would be temporary , so for three years .
&quot; today , we live more than thirteen years of age , and not only because of the gradual reconstruction would not change , &quot; says the owner .
mother and daughter then migrated from stodvacetimetrového to a smaller flat apartment 62 m2 and almost all the equipment dish out .
the action was not easy , things were stored for friends and arranging it took almost a year .
the new apartment was in pretty good condition , but had the necessary adjustments , such as painting the door or window replacement .
previous owner crashed his core , however , the owner of the most ironically and unnecessarily large impractically addressed a hall , and a small bathroom .
by joining the two rooms was a multifunctional living space .
the architects used for the definition of each of the zones and the breakdown room plasterboard , which allowed for the new location of the lights .
the first , which after a few years she was the removal of the walls in the living room .
this apartment has changed the disposition on 2 + kk , but the room was airy and open with panoramic views of the surrounding greenery .
the next step to partially improve the standard refund was pvc laminate floors .
with ivan &apos;s didn &apos;t .
years , i have to dig up the magazines about housing and looking for inspiration .
in one of them i recently discovered an interesting realization .
on a recommendation , i approached a young architect kamil douděrovou .
&quot; it was actually the most important step in the future , &quot; says ivana .
thanks to the renovation of the bathrooms is also available to edit .
architect teamed up space toilet and bathroom and two doors with otvíravými wings replaced one sliding , thereby saving space .
the bathroom is timeless , and also for disabled .
high-quality tiles imitate the sandstone , in the shower , a comfortable seat , shower bidetová toilet .
successful cooperation with kamila douděrovou continued .
in the context of the show how to build a dream was fast , but the fundamental change in the living room , which also participated in the architect martin Čeněk .
into the space , which was a merger of two smaller rooms , we had to get the three functions , dining , living and sleeping without the optical principles of classic division helped , for example , polopříčkami or the japanese .
&quot; this would result in the offending openness and unity of space , &quot; explains architect .
originally managed to separate sleeping and living area .
enough to turn back the two sofas and between them to build on the peace made the box covers .
dining area defined by shades of flooring and painting .
on the floor in the kitchen and the dining area was used by the architect quality marmoleum , sliding door has revived the wallpaper with a pattern .
kitchenette , if necessary , covering the sliding panels with wallpaper .
new flooring from antialergického marmolea from the laminate over the previous several advantages : soft non-slip surface without joints , and better sound insulation .
the system of ceilings and drywall niches highlighted colour is an example of how you can work with the space .
the colors i left on the a10 , i wished that it was joyful .
&quot; i like the orange , the same shade i had in the previous apartment , &quot; says ivana .
a poultice of grafoskla with the motif of a blooming magnolia is a practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element .
energetic warm tone of the architects chose a white , which underscored the modern functional style .
in a small apartment managed to save the book , inter alia , into the space under the window sills .
everything is at your fingertips , lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance .
in the předělaném of the interior works perfectly contrast the new legacy , such as the decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality works of art , which ivana collects whole life .
the last came on a kitchen .
the lockers were formerly stationed at both sides and the owner seemed a little here as in a tunnel .
the architect has reduced their number and distribution of přeskládala .
the simple design of the furniture is made to order , white area softens slightly pearly surface .
in a small space , thanks to the innovative solutions to fit a washer , dryer and dishwasher .
the appearance of the revived small kitchen an all-glass tiling the walls above the worktop .
unique grafosklo with digitally printed motif is an attractive , well maintained .
ivana chose flowers of magnolias , which remind her of a favorite neighborhood , where she lived for many years .
now it seems that he is happy here .
in the original bathroom was small bath tub and sink , the new owner has chosen a neutral shade .
great shower has a glass door ronal .
the task was to create an environment of clear simple space , in which the function and the device will be in harmony .
the interior of the material and the colour we unite and try for his elegant , cosy and not too crowded .
&quot; another condition for entering was wheelchair-accessible solutions having a minimum of obstacles and easy movement around furniture and the availability of items of daily use , &quot; adds kamila douděrová .

&quot; i meet with a number of problems that occur when the profession of nurses , these difficulties i feel and i am going to be involved in their solution . &quot;

jana péťová : step back .
so i decided to take a step back , but when i think about it , this is not really a step , but a big jump-jump a few years back , and the memories of my childhood .
it is the memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash the dishes , vacuum and do your homework .
even though these &quot; duties &quot; , it was mostly just theory , the wishes of the parents .
the practice was completely different-come from school , throw the bag in the corner and run out .
play with the other children &apos;s ball games , jump shot .
then , when the series , helena and her boys embroider festive tablecloth chainstitch machine for grandma &apos;s birthday .
and then finally , after warning unfortunately wash dishes , vacuum , in winter to carry wood into the tiled stove and tasks to do after dark under the lamp ( or relying on a classmate and write tasks instead of love verses addressed to the school of love ) .
in the morning , breakfast homemade strawberry jam ( from real fruit , not those jams that are sold now , whose content in addition to strawberries or prosperity ) and drink this tea from the dried herbs , which we like to collect with your mom .
i remember those magical evenings , when the silence in the room when we get to the nurse currently songs from the radio on cassette tapes , which were in the old kazeťáku loudly after my mom .
and then we get a pencil eraser tapes přetáčely and paul &apos;s one same song over and over again , our favorite and připíjely siphon .
or we get across the table telefonovaly using the cans , which had been tied with string to each other-and while we &apos;re at it calls us to be better heard , it was necessary to thoroughly clean the ears , then the match was uchošťour + wadding .
the minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now , and my parents could live from it so that we are nothing .
we didn &apos;t need any of those iphones , ipads or even cellphones and laptops or designer clothes .
clothing was handed down from generation to generation and the best &quot; addition &quot; to the closet was batik shirt domestic production using the sava .
from the electronics are managed to the satisfaction of the fort , a cassette recorder and a walkman , so that we have shared with the sister and the way that we use the same only in the train on the school trip .
came to us interesting to play with aunt bell hop or ludo , or as i have already said to go &quot; just &quot; out .
when i was a little older we got under the christmas tree video player , surely the parents save for a long time , but unfortunately for us long lodge .
my younger sister to narwhal strudel said so beautifully papal those tapes , so try , if spapá and strudel .
unfortunately , spapal , but it was his last bite .
well , this story still has a poor self , on a plate from my dad all the time .
he says that when she was little , narwhal lenka strudel into the video and think that it plays the recipe and nepřehrál , because it still doesn &apos;t know how to bake .
i remember how we all communicate , they communicate without your mobile phone , your computer .
together with her sister on holidays at grandma &apos;s to converse with her granddaughter neighbor when we meet again next year in the summer at the grandmothers-and so it was , so it was true .
we met .
promise you now with someone that you &apos;ll see in a year ? !
i remember in the winter , when the whole village we ran outside , building snowmen , rode on a snowy hill at the church on the sacks stuffed straw .
then we had dinner with the whole family together and talked about the previous day .
of course we slýchávaly before each dinner , the sister of the notorious phrase : &quot; go wash your hands ! &quot;
yes , it is true today , but certainly not to the tap in the bathroom přivázáné soap in the gauze from the lemons .
after dinner , when my dad in the garage &quot; worked &quot; for beer with brought from the village , we were with mom &apos;s on the floor , feet on tiled stove building , opened the door and watched the flame and listen to the crackling wood stove , poured from .
we were closer-really-we counted how many we have friends on the social network , we knew how much we have real friends , those !
we communicate together-we-did we get daily messages through various chats , sms .
there was nothing of the sort , and yet we knew far more about themselves .
and i could continue for a long time .
it is beautiful to remember , especially if i add these memories that this pair of albums where are neatly stuck black corners due to the black and white photos .
and if i happen to know how much i was behind the photos is always written in the year of acquisition .
i &apos;m looking at that while us power suit as pot haircuts , and we have the pants after cousin about two numbers more , nobody laughed at before , so it was normal ( not in ) .
and i &apos;d go back again for that step forward into reality .
by 2013 , and i &apos;ll wait , what modern times should be one for my devises .
what i know for sure is that these are my memories now for young teenage generation so at least somewhere , &quot; one hundred years &quot; for some reason , and i think a lot are coming from , that this &quot; předopičí &quot; time too happen .
i would wish it to them !
to save money , must know the young czechs .
but most of them don &apos;t even know what interest
still more czechs gives money away .
but do not reach to the champions in the savings in the region .
most of the money aside , saved the austrians , who saves an average of eur 181 per month .
a little more than the czechs save people in slovakia .
this follows from the erste group &apos;s savings barometer survey in the countries of central and eastern europe .
it also showed that the mood of the savers is improving , and two-thirds of the respondents are planning to give away more money .
while the czechs are roughly in the middle of the rankings of savers , in romania and serbia , people still rely on savings products .
for example , nearly every other srb save at home , according to the survey &apos;s &quot; under the pillow . &quot;
in the czech republic this year increased the amount of those who save a month &apos;s higher amounts .
yet last year , every month on various kind of savings odkládalo thousand up to 2.5 thousand crowns 26 percent of respondents , this year it is about five percent more .
the average monthly deposit in the year but fell slightly to 2078 crowns .
the biggest hit among the savings products is supplementary pension insurance .
it favors the 54 percent of czechs , while three years ago , it was the most popular method for evaluation of savings for only 36 percent of the people .
conversely , decreasing the popularity of building savings , compared to the previous year also fell significantly interested in investment funds .
those already uses only 16 percent of respondents , while last year it was almost a quarter of the people .
the survey also showed that although people consider important to save money , most of them don &apos;t know what the revenue on each of the products they are making .
especially young people under 30 years of age do not know how their money is interest-bearing .
in contrast , the best return on their awareness of the deposited money is the oldest group of respondents among people over 50 years knows that 73 percent of those surveyed .
in international comparison , the erste group , czechs lead in the use of online banking , which regularly uses 44 percent of the people .
the following are the slovaks , and the austrians is with 12procentním .

it is clear from the survey firm of ambruz &amp; dark deloitte legal , which examined the views 108 czech companies .
in connection with the approaching date of the effectiveness of the two key codes just now , a number of managers at the last moment begins to realize what they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies .
the biggest changes in the private law over the past 50 years , according to our opinion , affect all citizens and firms in the czech republic .
due to the wash of politicians lived a long time in the business sector uncertainty if the revolutionary changes eventually occurs , or not .
&quot; now they only have a few weeks to make the transition to a new law passed for their companies without complications , &quot; commented on the results of the partner ambruz &amp; dark deloitte legal jan spáčil .
of the 61 percent of the companies are dealing intensively with the new codes , 26 percent said that their companies have to take all necessary measures to ensure that they were ready in time .
furthermore , 35 per cent of this number is going to take the necessary measures in the near future .
against every fifth company rekodifikacemi has not yet addressed , yet it has a specific idea , how to prepare for them .
a total of 11 percent does not have an opinion and the issue cannot be assessed .
only eight percent of the companies acknowledges that issues associated with rekodifikacemi still went unaddressed .
the most important legal issue related to the new civil code is for the greatest number of surveyed companies concluding new contracts ( 21 percent ) , followed by the solution business conditions ( 16 percent ) and on changes in the real estate cadastre and liability ( 10 percent ) .
the contracts will take place one of the most important news throughout the rekodifikace , and the unification of the adjustments to the treaties only under the new civil code .
the current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial code shall be extinguished as a consequence of the contract law should become more transparent for the citizens and entrepreneurs .
&quot; in the case of entrepreneurs , the new legislation offers many innovations with emphasis on greater freedom of arrangement of relations , &quot; said the attorney , ambruz &amp; dark deloitte legal luke alone .
in the context of the business corporations act is considered to be the most important topic of almost a quarter of the companies the issue of increasing the accountability of statutory bodies .
the below topics regarding changes in the convening and conduct of the general meeting ( 15 percent ) and representation of the company ( 14 percent ) .
new legislation means tightening the obligations and potential impacts for the statutory bodies , in particular in a situation when the company threatened to bankrupt or it gets .
&quot; in practice , this means that if the members of the board of directors and executives of the companies do not act with due managerial diligence and indeed the impending bankruptcy of the company , may lose out on benefit for the performance of functions for the last two years , &quot; said spacil .
detection of nsaids increases the social paranoia of the state monitoring
one peaceful day at the end of august , the german police helicopter buzzed over the american consular office in frankfurt , the capital city of the german economy .
on the instructions of the federal office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the german domestic intelligence agency , the purpose of the mission was to take photos of the roof of the american outposts , which is located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
german media say that the office of the bfv , hoping that it will be able to identify the presence of scanning antennas , and this action launched in berlin , an exchange of views between the american and the german foreign minister .
james clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence , in september again insisted that the united states used its foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to kradly trade secrets for the benefit of foreign companies , american companies and enhance their international competitiveness , or increased their profit . &quot;
but since then , edward snowden , who became an informer from a coworker , he began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the united states , european governments and business leaders already know , if you have the words of the director of the trust .
after the news that the u.s. national security agency engaged in espionage in the brazilian oil company and gained access to the data , with whom they have american cloudoví providers including google and yahoo , reached a general paranoia about government monitoring of new dimensions .
the last straw came with the disclosure that chancellor angela merkel &apos;s phone was bugged ten years maybe .
if the target can be the most powerful person in europe , then there are certainly potential targets as well as leading businessmen .
snowden on how intensive cooperation between american intelligence agencies and companies .
i would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany must wake up , &quot; said oliver grün , president of bitmi , which represents small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
according to a survey released in july by the consultancy ey are the german company convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , the us now represents just as great a risk as china .
throughout the documentation , however , mr. snowdenem has so far uncovered no evidence that the united states to transmit trade secrets foreign companies with their own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu lacks certain abilities in the field of it and the internet , and said they should try to reduce its dependence on the united states :
business leaders are skeptical about it .
from the voices of the german parliament , that we should make the german google .
i can just close my eyes and slowly open it again .
this is not the way , says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software company sap .
if someone wanted a strong european it industry , it had 20 years ago to let die .
everything in germany subsidizes from coal after the car and the farmers .
everything except for the it industry .
the scope and the technical sophistication of u.s. spy agencies detected snowdenem is for some companies , who have felt that the greatest threat from the monitor represents china , yet shocking .
there is a large turnover in cloud-based computing , where europe &apos;s leaders in the broader scope realized that data stored in the usa fall under its jurisdiction and , therefore , are potentially countervailable .
according to a survey carried out by the business community of the cloud security alliance , about 10 percent of the non-members after the discovery of the u.s. program on data mining prism canceled the plans to use cloud-based provider in the us .
jim snabe , one of the directors-general of sap , says : &quot; we have a new question for customers , which a year ago was where my data is stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this jurisdiction ? &quot;
many of the german senior officials argue that the most recent messages are just confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to alienate their most precious secrets and this data must be protected at all costs .
that is economic espionage , it is no surprise .
always it was happening .
&quot; this is a crucial topic for many years and it has changed significantly , even during the current discussions , &quot; says kurt bock , director general of agro-chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us commercial and industrial level , just as we are we spying on them , because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate leaders generally do not want to brag too much guile , which made to this or did not provide an attacker the advantage .
in the case of large companies has long been recalls that take on the fair for free memory usb drive or leave open a laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise .
ulrich hackenberg , member of the board of automaker audi , says that for many years it is common practice to collect before the meeting of the board of mobile phones , to make it possible to use as a listening device .
the german office of the bfv advises managers to consider whether or not to use abroad simple prepaid cell phones because of the risk that smart phones can embezzle .
prepaid cell phones are then thrown away .
however , there is concern that the small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany there are many of these companies in their specific areas of leading representatives of the global market .
&quot; small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access , &quot; warns in its report to the bfv .
us your own company warns of economic espionage by the other countries .
according to the washington post the u.s. national intelligence estimate documents indicated in february next to russia , france and israel in the second series of offenders who are involved in hacking activities for economic newsletters , just behind china .
member of the council in the german company has made risk-free conclusion that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bernard squarcini , the former head of the french internal intelligence agency dcri , this month in one of the interviews , he said : &quot; full well know that all countries , even if it will cooperate in the fight against terrorism , spying on its allies . &quot;
new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking
scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine , which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse for life before the dependence on nicotine .
before testing on humans is necessary to perform additional tests , which will take several years , but professor ronald crystal from the medical faculty of weill cornell in new york , says that the first indications are good .
&quot; we hope that this kind of vaccination strategy may finally help to millions of smokers who tried to quit and have exhausted all of the methods available on the market today , but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches to overcome , &quot; said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been drawn up so as to bear the genetic information for the creation of antinikotinových antibodies .
virus selectively infects the cells of the liver , which then begin to create a smooth flow of these antibodies .
chasing all the molecules of nicotine antibodies in the blood stream and neutralize them before they get to the brain , which prevents the smoker got a nicotine hit .
in our tests , vakcinované mouse , which was subsequently delivered to nicotine , continue their normal activities .
but the mice that were not vakcinovány , &quot; calm &quot; , the researchers said , which is a sign that the nicotine they got to the brain .
experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
the previous tobacco vaccine have failed , because it contained the antibody .
the injection must be administered as often to maintain sufficient level of antibodies , so have proved expensive and impractical .
the cost of a new vaccine should be much lower , because they transform the cells of the liver at the factory for the production of antibodies .
professor crystal said that if a vaccine for people in the future will be completely safe , you might bring to children before they have the taste of a cigarette to try and avoid such dependence on nicotine .
however , it would be much more likely to have used smokers to stop .
&quot; they know that when they start smoking again , due to the nicotine vaccine no indulgence have not , and it will help them get rid of this bad habit , &quot; he said .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but cautioned that further research is needed .
a desperate cry of the obama voters
obama i voted twice , i shared the hope of possible change
he says that obama &apos;s sincere efforts to stymie the republican party &apos;s obstruction
obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of the obama administration &apos;s health care web sites or attacks of unmanned aircraft
memoirs of the obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could happen
nathaniel p . morris second year studying medicine at harvard university .
these days i &apos;m reading a very sad book .
about this book i thought that me during the grim days of my second year at the medical faculty encourage and restore a modicum of hope in me .
it &apos;s called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( boldness to win ) and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when i finish the testimonials of patients and i go to bed , book me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people take you breath and speeches .
the election ended in overwhelming and television coverage made us to reflect the historical value of this moment .
my classmates cried with joy and my parents hid &apos;s newspaper , which got hold of .
the white house headed for a young team of visionaries and the nation was ready for change .
during the inauguration in 2008 , obama had the support of 82 percent .
and here the book closing .
go to the present is a harsh awakening , as talk of a dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember those optimistic days – seem to be distant memories , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years after i dropped my first ballot , actually changes .
it was certainly nothing from what i had imagined .
i recognize that obama has reached a series of large and diverse achievements--from the law on the care available through the evacuation of troops from iraq and end the policy of &quot; nothing to ask , not to say anything &quot; after the killing of osama bin laden .
in addition , i believe that the partisan obstruction reversed so much efforts to move our nation forward : among other things , it is immigration reform , the ability of the public to choose the health care and the closure of the base in guantánámu .
but after many situations when i &apos;m in front of colleagues and friends defended the obama administration , i as regards the explanation , which can provide , come to the absolute limit .
i found myself in the place of political despair .
obstruction of the republicans cannot explain the consent to the interception of foreign leaders nor with the drones , airstrikes that kill innocent children overseas .
you cannot explain to them that the national security agency collects data about the private lives of americans , even those who are chasing the wrong cabinet meeting reveals .
cannot be held responsible for the execution of anwar al-awlakího , an american citizen , without a proper court or for the reduction of public expenditure and contributions during the presidential campaign .
cannot be justified by the findings of the report , which says that the white house &apos;s efforts to muzzle the media are &quot; the most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and , most recently , cannot excuse the failure to create more than 3 years after the signing of the act of the available care simple web pages .
i do not know whether something like that could be expected .
whether i &apos;ve had in 18 years , suggested that the government may be too much at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it .
obviously does not have a predictable function of the chosen course and our public dialogues will form an opposition political party and incidents such as the massacre in newton .
but all of the examples that i have stated above , is to a large extent seem to be the result of his own decision of the administration .
and it bothers me the most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was excited about his candidacy .
mitt romney was zmatečnou and nevybroušenou as an alternative , and it seemed that he could not consolidate its policy or position .
i had a feeling that a second term for obama , free from the pressure of the next election , filled with hope , which we once heard .
yet it is a return to 2008 – how to support obama this week dropped below 45 % – through this book becomes increasingly difficult .
it makes me remember the series of promises that faded .
this week i read a chapter in the book about how obama in primaries in pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with clinton .
for additional meeting during the campaign , he told his staff that they must get back into the pace and remain faithful to its mission .
&quot; i want to get back our charm , &quot; he said .
we must not forget who we are .
five years have passed , mr president , and i totally agree with you .

syria destroyed their resources for the production of chemical weapons , says supervisory authority
syria destroyed vital equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas , said thursday the committee for global surveillance of chemical weapons , while violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country , and it &apos;s close to one of the places where they are in accordance with assumptions stored toxic substances .
also on thursday , the syrian activist group said that since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago killed more than 120 000 inhabitants .
notification to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons came a day before 1. in november ,
the term , which this organization is based in the hague has damascus for destroying or disabling the operation of all the equipment for the production of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals to create poison gas and ammunition .
completion of this initial phase of destruction in principle is a major milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy by mid-2014 , all chemical weapons to damascus .
the destruction of the equipment means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and supplies .
it is assumed that this country has about 1 000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when fighting raged thursday in the town of safira , about which the experts as the headquarters of the chemical-weapons factories and stores , said the syrian observatory for human rights , based in the uk .
a group of activists who , through a network of activists in syria , to monitor the total number of victims , thursday announced that 120 296 people have died .
it is supposed to be a 61 067 civilians , including 6 365 children .
on the government side to go 29 954 members armed forces , bashar al-assad , 18 pro-government fighters and 678 187 gunmen from lebanon &apos;s hezbollah .
among the zabitými to be also 2 202 government defectors , and approximately 5 375 opposition fighters , many of whom are foreigners .
on 25 april 2005. in july , the united nations estimated that from march 2011 in 100,000 people died in the conflict .
since then , this number has not been updated .
the conflict has forced about 2 million people , have left the country .
the unit fought in the asadovy safiře against the insurgents , many of whom are lumped in with al-qaeda , for weeks .
observatory on thursday said that the losses were on both sides , but did not have specific numbers .
the fight &apos;s danger faced by inspectors for chemical weapons , who during his mission , when in the midst of the ongoing civil war , syria to get rid of the chemical arsenal , must deal with tight deadlines .
in a statement from the office of the opcw , which closely cooperates with the united nations , it was said that his team is now &quot; satisfied that verified--and watched the destruction of the declared principle of syrian-equipment for the production and blending / filling &quot; .
he added that &quot; there are currently no planned further inspection activities &quot; .
earlier this week , inspectors said they have completed the first round of verification work , when they visited 21 of the 23 seats declared by damascus .
the inspectors said that because of concerns about security were not able to visit the two places .
on thursday , the office of the opcw said that these two places were in syria &quot; abandoned and ... the items of the programme of chemical weapons that it contained were moved to two other declared seats , which was checked . &quot;
was not immediately clear whether the device in safiře was one of those places that the opcw inspectors couldn &apos;t visit .
syria has agreed to a plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the executive committee of the office of the opcw .
&quot; i bow to the courage and bravery you have expressed in the fulfillment of this most challenging mission ever , this organization , &quot; said ahmet uzumcu , director of observers in his commentary issued by the opcw .
now in its third year , standing against each other in the civil war , mainly sunni muslim rebels and the government , with its asadova security forces , which are full members of the alawitů sect , the offshoots of shia islam .
as regards the further development of vantage point , the head of ramí abdul rahman said on wednesday a strong explosion occurred inside the air defense equipment in the syrian coastal province of lázikíja .
he said that the cause of the explosion was not known .
alexei miller of gazprom says that the pipeline in bulgaria is launching a new era of gas
start of construction of the south stream gas pipeline in bulgaria means running one of the largest european energy projects , said the director of gazprom .
&quot; today we are witnessing a milestone : started construction on the bulgarian part of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , &quot; said the president of gazprom alexei miller in a statement .
this project is a key element of energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream pipeline would add diversity to the russian export routes across europe .
a contractual dispute between gazprom and its partners in ukraine , which brings most of the russian gas to europe , adding to the risk of conventional routes , officials say .
miller says that direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are &quot; forever &quot; be deleted .
once the project begins operation in 2015 , the bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the gas pipeline south stream at a discounted price .
gazprom says that the building is in the other countries in the direction of the flow to start at the end of this year .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
early puberty : advanced previously
research showed that african-american women and hispánky reach puberty earlier than their white contour lines .
physical changes do not imply that approaching puberty
it is not proved that the hormones or other chemical substances
experts say that one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity .
the trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys .
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children &apos;s health and family problems .
zděsit should be a mother when her daughter begin to grow breasts and pubic hair in 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of children &apos;s doctors this week in orlando , fla . , explained the paediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz , that these physical changes are relatively common among american girls and represent a new standard .
&quot; i spent a lot of time by parents said that it is usually not a sign of rapid development toward full adolescence , &quot; said kaplowitz
visible signs of development , as is the growth of breasts , pubic hair and underarm and body odor , for girls there earlier .
for the past forty years , however , was only a small shift in the age when the first menstruation occurs .
in the united states is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years of age in the 1970s .
&quot; when they start to develop breasts , expire at least two to three years before the first menstruation , &quot; said kaplowitz , who is also the author of the book &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem &quot; ( early puberty in girls : the essential guide for mastering this frequent problem )
the most reliable test of how puberty continue , it is time .
discussion about what triggers the actual beginning of puberty , but if growth is accompanied by the growth of the breast spurtem before 8. a year of age , the girl is considered to be &quot; prematurely mature &quot; .
in most cases , the process slows down or stops--can doctors closely monitor child .
faster growth can be a reason for it to an endocrinologist he in order to avoid serious problems , such as a tumor or cyst .
there are medical procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences : premature aging bones , which may eventually lead to the cessation of growth and dwarfism in adulthood .
recommendations for medications and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child , development speed , the speed of growth and emotional maturity .
psychosociologické are also important aspects .
as regards the deployment of drugs , is cautious , but kaplowitz acknowledges that &quot; the suppression of puberty can alleviate problems with the behaviour of girls and its feelings that differ from their peers . &quot;
understand is the next big problem : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young daughter should menstruation .
&quot; do you fear that you may become pregnant , or how it will deal with sanitation , &quot; kaplowitz said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman , whose daughter started having menstrual periods in 10 years .
although there were indications of menstruation and we talked , not ready emotionally .
she came home from school scared and upset , that is from their girlfriends first .
there are many well known theories about the causes of early puberty .
however , there is still a coherent set of evidence that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
boys like girls – reaching puberty earlier .
kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most important reason is the obesity epidemic .
in 2001 , he helped with the implementation of a study on girls aged from 6 to 9 years , that connects the body fat with the timing of puberty .
other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
african-american women have in this country , and hispánky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .
explanations are various .
from a global perspective , it seems that the patterns of early puberty are affected by everything from the economic conditions through the climate to the genes .
another puzzle : although for boys at a young age is already emerging pubic hair in her face and hair , the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls .
other doctors participating in a conference of the american association of physicians ( aap ) have added further complexity to this topic .
acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers .
&quot; we have to be careful when it comes to how we identify the real onset of puberty , &quot; said lawrence silverman , paediatric endocrinologist from the goryebské children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents shouldn &apos;t hesitate to get from your child &apos;s doctor &apos;s instructions on how to talk with your child .
&quot; it may mean the need to talk with a child sooner than you expected , &quot; kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , your child probably will respond well .
girls who evolve sooner , they need assurance that even if this is done prematurely , this process is a normal part of life .
hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to syria .
waiting is the decisive battle .
the lebanese movement hezbollah has deployed 15,000 of its fighters to the north of damascus , in preparation for the decisive battle of the mountainous area of kalamún .
according to reports , israel is still advanced in the raid wednesday on two sites in western syria , destroyed the missiles intended just hezbollah .
the lebanese shiite organization fights in syria on the side of the army .
the program is also the fight against israel , which the syrian conflict nevměšuje , but clearly said that to prevent the transfer of weapons to the hezbollah in lebanon .
reports on wednesday of israeli raid on warehouses of weapons in western syria only clarified .
israel did not comment on the attack , but it was confirmed by u.s. sources .
according to the syrian website dampress.com hit a rocket fired from the area of the mediterranean sea the syrian missile base south of džabla snúbar latákíje .
the news station al-arabiya said that two warehouses were hit , in which missiles were ready to be transported to lebanon .
according to its sources , it was a russian rocket production sa-8 .
israel refused to comment on the report , but military analyst ron ben yishai said that syria is trying to continuously supply the hezbollah rockets and the syrian air force teaches members of armed hezbollah with rockets section to handle .
sa-8 missiles are out-of-date , which has the syrian army since the 1980s. for years .
they are located on a rolling chassis .
although they are relatively primitive , thanks to the mobility and small size can be easily hidden .
they are equipped with radar , but after firing off missiles , so it is hard to focus .
latákíja is situated in western syria , in an area inhabited by the ruling alávity .
it &apos;s a well guarded the area and hezbollah has in the past participated in the fighting in western syria .
claims that helps protect the syrian shia community , to which the alávité belongs to .
now he is alleged to have 15,000 of its fighters ready to help capture the army back to the kalamún .
together with hezbollah strengthens its troops there also the syrian army .
kalamún lies between damascus and the third largest city of the country homsem .
the battle has to be from sources of al-arabíji in retaliation for the recent attack on the headquarters of the syrian opposition shiite brigade of abu abbas in the shia parts of abolfazl damascus .
hezbollah , the syrian army this year helped win back the city of qusayr at the lebanese border .
many of the insurgents moved to kusajru from kalamúnu .
it says that maliki has a big share in the reconstruction of the sectarian violence in iraq , which is said to be part of the work is also fighting in neighboring syria .
social bargains .
social democracy is crumbling , the christian democratic union and babišovci talking and common procedure .
if the social democrats in a few weeks , will include representatives from zmátoří to the negotiating table with perfectly sehranými partners , who puts on the table the finished list of requirements including ministerial posts .
the envoys of the social democrats then either eaten up by sour grapes , the coalition , or the vrtkavou minority government .
bohuslav sobotka after four days , when carried on a wave of sympathy , for the first time .
yesterday he could not dominate the political panel and force allows liars to resign .
certified negotiator for the party is so far only he , other members of the team will be allowed until after a crucial session of the central executive committee ( Úvv ) .
i apologized to the members of the panel and now citizens .
to lie is not , in my personal life or in public .
&quot; it was a mistake , &quot; he said after the meeting of the management of social democracy michal hašek .
he added that as the first vice-president of the attached .
&quot; their decision to let 10 . november Úvv , &quot; hasek said .
similarly , the vice-chairman of the Čssd was zdeněk Škromach and the chief parliamentary club jerome tejc .
he , however , pointed out that he was elected only two days ago .
both meps said they will do everything to ensure that padesátičlenný social club was one voice .
the absurd theatre put on the crown of michal hašek sentence : &quot; i am a member of the social democrats for fifteen years , i have always been loyal to its brand and i respected the decision of party organs . &quot;
or another lie in a live transmission .
or perhaps when the invitation to sobotkově &apos; s resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team forgot that august , 57 percent of the Úvv held that bohuslav sobotka is a candidate on the prime minister ?
the chief of the social democrats , however , the convening of an Úvv to the next sunday , has produced a powerful army of enemies .
his opponents have ten days to e-mail flooded 192 members of this body , as well as a variety of media gossip and rumors , possibly to remind real errors sobotkovy political career .
it will powerfully to wash dirty clothes , hints of dark alliance between uhlobaronem , zdeněk bakalou and sobotkovým wing .
it will discuss the friendly relationship of bohuslav sobotka and influential lawyer radek pokorny .
vybublají disputes in the moravian-silesian-moravian or organization .
warning are the words of mayor of ostrava and ramakrishna s ally peter kajnara : &quot; i signed the charter 77 , therefore , that the country didn &apos;t become idiots . &quot;
if the Úvv already met this weekend , liars would probably were forced way of sacrificing its functions .
traitors to pay off his head &apos;s ashes and remain .
and currently head of the cssd winning then ends up with the nickname bohuslav pyrrha .
the united nations celebrates the new objectives to fight poverty
the united nations immediately begins work on a new set of goals , which replaces the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which were introduced 12 years ago for the purpose of coping with global poverty .

andrej babiš begins to reconcile , that his movement did not have the time to learn the political craft in opposition , and that will have to be straight to the government that there was .
the president admitted in an interview that for the right , which comes out tomorrow .
putin promised the organic plan the olympics he thwarts the giant secret dumps
fans of winter sports had already cut one meter to the start of the olympic games in sochi , others on their preparation of the visor is still larger concern .
russian olympiad , even starts up in february , faced with another scandal .
the russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that the preparation and holding of the games not in the least does not disturb nature in the krasnodar krai in the foothills of the caucasus mountains , where for four months head thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors .
indeed , after the olympics in vancouver , the russians had set the bar very high , built the canadian games in the history of the olympics includes as the most environmentally friendly .
it seems , however , that russian president vladimir putin &apos;s commitment to organize the games with &quot; zero waste &quot; , took a long time ago .
ap reporters last week discovered a giant landfill construction material in the village of achštyr near sochi .
therefore , the dump , full of building materials , tires , cans and insulating foams in august found the environmentalists , which immediately reported .
the russian authorities are kály and landfill .
but just for a moment .
last week , reporters at the sight on a landfill the size of three football pitches .
is not the only one in the area has several such places , described the british the times .
at the place of work of the russian railways , the state monopoly , which is roughly the šedesátikilometrovou path between the airport in sochi and sports resort .
the firm , which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles , led one of the close associates of vladimir putin &apos;s jakunin .
in august , the railroad from the landfill started by someone from the subcontractors .
local residents are already but desperate .
according to the inhabitants of the achštyru around the village for three months day and night buses trucks full of waste material .
according to the experts , that the waste contaminates the river mzymtu , the other local streams , and finally the black sea .
&quot; the water from the water sources on sočské contaminates the next ten to fifteen years , &quot; said vladimir kimajev of the worksheet to the british environmental non-profit organization ewnc .
illegal landfills are not the only problem the russian organizing committee and the government .
the most expensive olympics in history , according to the opposition , one big tunnel .
for comparison : the games in sochi will cost 51 billion dollars , while the summer olympics in beijing 2008 came to $ 43 billion .
last year &apos;s games in london were only 19 billion , and vancouver mentioned nine billion .
in addition to the corruption scandals , project delays and fears , if eventually there will be enough snow , there have been reports , too , that when you work at the exhibition venues and infrastructure to comply with human rights .
last month , one of the workers sewed her mouth to protest , they didn &apos;t get paid for two months .
many are also worried about how the russian organizers during the games , popasují with the new law , which bans the promotion of homosexuality .
some visitors are going to russian gays at the olympics .
the rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in australia for the time being in force
australian airline passengers will have to remain off their tablets and smart phones during starting and landing as well , regardless of the changes in the u.s. for the purpose of easing regulations for these devices .
the u.s. federal aviation administration ( faa ) gave american companies the space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read on their devices , e-books , watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight , if the device will remain in the &quot; air &quot; mode .
passengers no longer can do during most of the flight , but annoys many people that they cannot have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing .
australian carriers to examine this decision from the american carriers requires a large piece of work , in order to meet the requirements , but indicated that they soon plan to change their practices .
the civil aviation safety authority ( casa ) also said that this notification is explored , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in australia are still in force .
&quot; casa currently has no specific legislation regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft , &quot; he said .
this issue is covered by provisions which require aircraft operators to ensure that at all times the safety will be maintained and that the passengers shall act in accordance with the safety instructions , which they acquire from the crew members .
virgin , which already with casa talked about extending the use of the on-board entertainment system , wi-fi , was in favour of the change , but announced that it shall be subjected to the decision of the regulatory authority .
&quot; we would appreciate if the office carried out the analysis of the permission to use the casa electronic devices , because you really think it would be now , when we have ( wireless on-board entertainment ) , improved the customer experience , &quot; the spokesman said .
qantas has announced that they will hold the current rules for the time being .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing , and we have no intention to change any time soon , &quot; he said .
faa rules apply to u.s. airlines .
but we are concerned about the constant developments in the regulatory field , which can be useful for our passengers , and be sure to thoroughly study the faa &apos;s decision and the reasons for it are .
in the case of air carriers from the united states , the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their air fleet .
carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference on mobile phones , and also revise the manuals , training materials , programmes for carry-on luggage and passenger information .
&quot; as soon as the airline confirms the tolerance its fleet , passengers can afford to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-readers and smart phones , at any altitude , &quot; the faa said .
in rare cases , low visibility , the crew ordered passengers to turn off the device during the landing .
the group also recommended that the heavier the device during takeoff and descent safely stored under a seat or in an overhead storage space .
nonsense in the film gravity , but it is a beautiful spectacle , say experts
fantastic film from space gravity some time after the premiere of the remaindered in the czech republic .
saw him in october , according to the union of film distributors nearly 150 thousand spectators and earned over 26 million crowns .
most of the reviews evaluated positively the snapshot .
it is , however , other irregularities .
server lidovky.cz asked experts from among astronomers and astrophysicists as they rather liked the film and noticed some nonsense , which appeared in the film .
jiří dušek ( director of the observatory and planetarium in brno ) : i like science and fantastic movies , which i consider to be modern , dreamlike fairy tales .
the film including the gravity , though disguised as &quot; physically real &quot; performance .
it is not , but this does not mean , that would be bad .
i enjoyed him very much .
note you may need to sandra bullock hair that somehow floating in weightlessness .
hubbův the space telescope and the international space station are significantly different current rail systems , and therefore cannot be seen in one shot .
some viewers of the film blamed unrealistically applied effect , and all fire behavior in weightlessness .
the suits would also withstood that such wounds .
the heroes in the movie gravity will often get into a collision with different subjects and suits without major problems , everything lasts .
the criticism was not spared neither the empresses .
so extensive a tragedy on the earth orbit is by some chatters unrealistic .
in addition , wonders why the doctor was sent into space to correct technique .
people on the forums arguing about &quot; unreal &quot; behavior of the lan .
the said acts as if it were intended for bungee jumping .
marcel grün ( director of the observatory and planetarium hl. m . prahy ) : i &apos;ve seen him so far only on a broad canvas , but clearly i can say , i was enchanted .
i &apos;m glad it wasn &apos;t a film documentary , but science-fiction .
and for such a story , the author has the right ( almost the obligation ) not to hold consistently reality .
&quot; more than you mentioned irregularities it touched me , as is shown by three space station with degrading the level of techniques ( the last time chinese ) . &quot;
&quot; indeed , china will be up to the end of the decade and probably will look better than it is in the movie . &quot;
vladimír karas ( director of the astronomical institute of the academy of sciences of the czech republic ) : the computer-generated scenes the authors very successfully to nuclear physics , and science-oriented viewer will appreciate that different cosmic collisions and crashes quite rightly maintains momentum , speaking dictionary , physics , also look at the earth from space is a very realistic including the thin skin of the atmosphere and surface of the aurora on the polar regions .
a more detailed examination of the irregularities i &apos;m sure they can find .
additionally , for example , when reading the comments , i found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space junk in orbit in some scenes appears to be reversed , than this should in fact be ( from west to east ) .
jiří Štěpán ( employee of the astronomical institute of the czech academy of sciences ) : some of the stuff makers adapt to meet your needs , but no major and blatant sin against the logic or the laws of nature , i have not seen in the movie and in comparison with other movies like the focus is to see that the creators have given depend on the credibility of displayed events .
from moments that do not give a sense of worth to designate the fact that hubblův space telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than the iss .
the result is significantly different relative speed and the rescue operation would therefore in fact could not take place , as was shown in the film .
then in the time department kowalského ( clooney ) , and stone &apos;s office ( bullock ) i noticed that the iss was , therefore , not clear origin of the forces acting on the kowalskiho , forcing both players to let go at a time when no longer move relative to each other .
bombardier profit fell as a result of the decline in shipments and orders
canadian aircraft manufacturer bombardier and trains reported on thursday a 15-percent drop in net profit , which is caused by a smaller number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contracting problems in the train unit .
bombardier , based in montreal , also did not disclose any data on air test for its new cseries aircraft type , nor to offer current information , as regards whether this aircraft with an ambitious plan to start commercial operation by next september .
after initiating a test flight about a month ago and a half plane flew only three times and raised the question of whether the test phase is progressing well .
the results fell short of estimates , and the shares on the stock exchange in toronto have fallen about 8 percent .
cameron doerksen , an analyst at state-owned bank thursday lowered the rating from &quot; higher productivity &quot; on &quot; the performance of the sector &quot; with the expectation that the stock market will be during the next quarter or two experiencing limited growth .
&quot; while the smaller aircraft we mostly had expected the profit margin in the field of transport significantly disappointed us , &quot; said doerksen , in a report to clients .
with the way the trial program will continue , we believe that the bombardier cseries aircraft order gets new .
however , if in the coming months will not be notified of any new orders , we assume that market skepticism will grow in relation to this programme .
bombardier hopes to finish in the cseries aircraft the lower area of the market that is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was revealed in march and , after months of delay , the first flight took place in september .
the number of binding orders , however , achieves modest cseries aircraft , 177 , because potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to be able to verify the claim of the company relating to the low consumption and savings on the cost of the transport aircraft .
currently , a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators .
chief executive officer pierre beaudoin had expected that , when placing the first aircraft into commercial use reaches its goal , the company bombardier 300 binding orders .
the executives also assured on thursday , analysts and the media , that the program is progressing according to plan .
&quot; the test aircraft was left on the ground longer than expected , &quot; he said in a conference call beaudoin and noted that the examination on earth and software updates have been scheduled during the downtime of the aircraft .
each manufacturer is planned otherwise .
we decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and we did .
it will happen during the entire flight program .
according to the company , bombardier would be the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other soon after .
analysts are still skeptical of this , that would be the first customer of the cseries aircraft could begin 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier claims that evaluated his plan to put the aircraft into service and in the coming months will provide updated information .
&quot; this slow pace of flight tests--even though it is in accordance with the internal plan of the company bombardier — probably will strengthen our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of the year 2015 , &quot; said doerksen .
from us $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share in the previous year in the third quarter ended sept . 30 . september net profit fell to bombardier $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents .
turnover dropped marginally from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .
according to the thomson reuters ibes system analysts had expected yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion .
the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , said that compared with 57 aircraft for a year before he added during the quarter just 45 aircraft .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft on 26 .
unfulfilled orders in aviation division consisted of 30 . september 32.9 billion , which does not change even at 31 . december .
&quot; the results in aviation were in line with our views , but the low order intake and overall condition of the market failed us , &quot; said beaudoin .
revenue in the aerospace industry fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest manufacturer of trains , said that revenue in this division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
unfulfilled contracts in the transport sector accounted for 30 . september 32.6 billion , compared to 31 . december marginal growth .
the profit margin in the traffic division was affected by problems with the realisation of several large contracts .
the executives said that in the fourth quarter will be provided new views .
shares of bombardier , which also announced the arrival of financial director patrick pichettea , google fell during trading on thursday afternoon , about 8.5 percent of the value of us $ 4.83 .
the brazilian company embraer sa , the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the company &apos;s closest competitor , bombardier announced on thursday a 10-percent slump in quarterly profits .

as a result of a tax on the owners of the foreign real estate bursting bubble london
the finance ministry &apos;s preliminary revenue tax vyčíslilo financial assets , but is waiting for the final decision of mr osborne , who was in the budget from the year 2012 introduced a fee of 7 % for the transfer of real estate for the building at a price of over £ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company , rather than as individuals .
the yield from the fee for the transfer of real estate in the housing stock in the districts of westminster and kensington and chelsea , which in fiscal year 2012 / 13 has reached 708 million pounds , already exceeds the total for northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north east , north west and yorkshire and the humber .
mr cook said : &quot; due to the increase in real estate transfer for high-value homes and related legislation , which is intended to prevent the evasion of taxes , it is very difficult to argue that the property of high value is a little taxed , regardless of the effect of an obsolete tax system . &quot;
he added that &quot; this step could cause some foreign investors that property in london are reluctant to buy , or that existing owners are reluctant to sell . &quot;
leading real estate – the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market as prices--in the rich belt , which extends from fulham after wimbledon last year recorded an increase of a record number of 11.8 % .
prices in the middle of london continue to show steady growth year by year 5.6 % , but they were overshadowed by the booming &quot; domestic market &quot; , on which , according to a survey of real estate agents savills were southwest , north ( 7.4 % ) and east ( 6.5 % ) .
