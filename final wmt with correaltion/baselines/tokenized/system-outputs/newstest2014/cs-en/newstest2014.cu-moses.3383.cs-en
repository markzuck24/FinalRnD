egypt says the first freely elected president
muhammad mursí folded the inaugural oath , but his triumphant day hardly says the political unrest in egypt .
islamists muhammad mursí promised a `` new egypt , &apos; &apos; when he was formally sworn into office as the first freely elected president of this country , and that after hosni mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier .
in his inauguration before the constitutional court is mursí also become the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he took the oath before 18 judges dressed in black robes in the mansion built overlooking the nile , which recalls an ancient egyptian temple .
`` we aspire to a better tomorrow , a new egypt and a second republic , &apos; &apos; said mursí during the ceremony , broadcast live on national television .
`` today , the egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &apos; &apos; said mursí , sixty - year - old engineer trained in the us , and a member of the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that was for most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation the target of fierce attacks by individual governments .
when mursí shortly after 11 p. m. local time , arrived in a convoy of cars , guarded building hundreds of soldiers and police officers .
only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse , to celebrate the president , and unlike the presidential pomp of mubarak &apos; s period was right only briefly stopped to motorcade ride usually busy route linking the city centre with the suburbs to the south .
personal prestige mursího , derisively known as charismatic `` spare tire &apos; &apos; of the muslim brotherhood , has risen sharply since his victory and his friday speech , which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of the islamists , but also all of those who want to lead to the end of the revolt against the authoritarian mubarak .
`` egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &apos; &apos; said mursí dressed in a blue suit with a red tie social judges in the wood - paneled chamber , where he took the oath .
mursí later traveled to cairo university , where he was to deliver the inaugural speech .
while standing at attention , he received a formal welcome from the military band , which played the national anthem .
there was the military leader field marshal hussein tantawi .
his arrival was accompanied with chants of `` the army and the people are one hand &apos; &apos; from the mouth of the hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall university .
university in cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970 s became a bastion of islamic student movement .
mursí wrote friday in a symbolic oath in tahrir square , where the revolution began , that ended mubarak &apos; s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed that he grasps the presidential powers of his office by the military council , which took over from the exiled leader .
but the agreement with the composition of the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , bent to the will of the army , which suggests that a power struggle will continue .
mursího speech in tahrir square was filled with dramatic populist gestures .
who wants to really get to know a city , he should go to the cemetery .
his visit reveals more than a walk in the centre of the gilded with monuments , churches and museums , more than told the guidebook .
`` many people are reading graves . &apos; &apos;
slowly wander graveyards and acquire an intimate insight into local realities .

how to express their social status , which have a taste .
and the condition of the graves found and how to ensure their dead relatives .

the european elite is ready to trade with britain ?
the campaign of business for britain ( trade for britain ) was launched in april , with the promise of a combined businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the eu want to see british entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs .
to this end , we entered the largest and most comprehensive survey , in which we are the leading british entrepreneurs asked for their opinions on britain , trade and the eu .
yougov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing british businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will be for many surprises .
we found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside europe and focus on countries that modernising and grow , while the eu states have stagnated .
they want to see how the government prefers the new commercial ties with countries such as china , india and brazil to mired in the long and painful process of reforming the european institutions .
when we asked for their opinions on specific policy areas - from the monopoly regulations after the laws on products - most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key skills should return to westminster .
there was a general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs , they said that the costs of the brussels regulations now outweigh the advantages of being part of the commercial area - expressed consent even 40 percent of large enterprises , traditionally the most pro - european companies .
and finally , our survey of leading companies revealed that most tellingly of knowledge , and that a clear majority wants britain to seek to amend the contract and the relationship with the eu , which should be based on trade , not politics .
the findings , which they can identify companies of various sizes and the main business groups , shows that the business sector is pushing for `` meaningful change &apos; &apos; , which take effect back to britain .
there is a lot at stake - reaching changes to the treaty and a better deal for britain may mean a profit of up to 16 % of the vote in a referendum for staying in the eu .
the prime minister should not hesitate : this survey shows that british business supports his plan to reform the terms of britain &apos; s membership of the eu .
it also shows that the business sector expects that this reform will mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards britain .
a better deal for britain is possible , and because of the way the eurozone is underway for closer economic and fiscal union , even more necessary .
the priority has to be jobs and growth in britain and , as shown by the results of our survey , for business , that means the focus on trade and fundamental change in the regulatory approach to brussels .

frontier airlines plans to charge for carry - on luggage
frontier airlines plans in their years charge up to $ 100 for the imposition of hand luggage on board .
frontier airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $ 100 for a carry - on luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although in its announcement on wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep the soda .
the new fee for carry - on luggage concerns the luggage in the upper storage space , so that a small bag under the seat will remain free .
the company frontier says it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 , where passengers will be paying to wait until the arrival of the gate .
frontier spokesman kate o &apos; malley , listen , stated that 100 fee is to encourage passengers to pay for care .
`` we chose this fee , &apos; &apos; she said .
airlines began to charge the first and second brought bags in 2008 .
passengers tried to avoid those fees and stuffed into bags stashed in the storage space , as close as they could , so in this area often had not taken place .
fees are one way to learn the passengers on board were less stuff .
o &apos; malley , listen , said that the new charge is not really to get more money .
the point is that most loyal customers of frontier is quite clear that finding a place at the top of the storage space is increasingly difficult .
passengers who bought tickets on the website of the company will not pay .
this means that one of the passengers in the queue at the gate of the frontier can bring baggage to pay nothing , while the other passengers in the queue for the same bag will pay $ 100 .
o &apos; malley , listen , said that web sites and check - in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers will learn about the fee before his arrival to the gate .
the new fee company frontier for carry - on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer , but the date has not been set yet .
passengers often on fees for baggage and other fees complain , but the airline is love .
claims that baggage handling costs money , and passengers who want this service , would have to pay for it .
many on wall street see additional fees for baggage as a sign that the airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses .
but most of the fees for carry - on luggage .
the company spirit airlines as the first charge of hand luggage three years ago and other low cost airline allegiant air later followed her example .
the only company that has such charges , is the hungarian wizz air , says adviser in the field of air transport jay sorensen , who closely follows the additional fees .
in its report in december 2011 estimated that a fee for carry - on luggage company spirit will bring in $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , a former manager of midwest airlines recently flew with spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when he met with an unusual company spirit fee for carry - on luggage .
`` getting into the aircraft that was as smooth as i have ever seen in my career of air , &apos; &apos; he said .
i was waiting at the gate to see the gnashing of teeth and argument .
the plane was full , he said , `` and going through in an instant . &apos; &apos;
frontier also on the model of the company &apos; s spirit apply charges for coffee , tea , soda and juice .
frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice , may keep the soda and coffee will be free upgrades .
the water will continue to be free of charge .
us airways in 2008 briefly tried to introduce charges for drinks , but after complaints from passengers about seven months later , no other major airline .
the last move of frontier charge for carry - on luggage , passengers years if you purchase directly from the airline , is her last attempt to steer customers directly on their website .
airlines are the online travel retailers , such as orbitz , from 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
it could all airlines complaint that led passengers to purchase directly from them , the place to do it through online travel agencies .
the company , however , frontier in this area have gone far .
in september started giving customers who bought over the internet travel agency , only half of miles in the frequent flyer program .
in the center of the crop reward miles flown to 25 percent of the miles of the journey .
so the way companies frontier long 1000 miles purchased over the internet travel agency means reward 250 miles .
the company also allows customers to select their seat in advance , only in the event that the purchase will directly through the company &apos; s web site frontier .
the company has the frontier in your home town of denver a loyal customer base , but its business is beginning to shrink and losing money .
the financial results mentioned in the center of the corporate partner of republic airways holdings revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity in the first quarter decreased by nearly 13 percent
the company is selling the republic this airlines trying to solve the financial problems of frontier .

in 2005 , when the survey conducted for the first time , the share of 26 percent .
in the last two investigations ( 2007 , 2010 ) settled down to about 60 percent .
advertising job opportunities in , according to the analysis of the largely reflects the current situation on the labour market .
an example would be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis .
for example , in 2007 , it was in the same reporting period published almost 25 900 ads in 2012 it was less than half .
the offer of jobs on the internet is directed towards closer , notably more qualified group of professions .
by contrast , the job offer in the daily press covers a broad spectrum of professions , including those working - class , said the author pauline Šťastnová analysis .
the intensity of the representation of the professional groups in both media is different .
on the internet , took first place ads for managers and executives , the sales representative , programmers and financial experts .
the position of programmers or leading small business was only on the internet .
in the daily newspaper &apos; s share of these specialist professions significantly lower , conversely , a large representation belongs in the service and blue - collar professions .
among the most commonly reported requirements that employers are expressed through advertising offerings include education , of course .
the reference was to other areas of knowledge of foreign languages , in english .
in the daily press was the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language included in the three percent of ads on the internet in 37 percent .
in only two percent of employers advertisements for active knowledge of two foreign languages .
claims for &apos; computer literacy &apos; appeared in 40 percent of ads ( in the daily newspaper in 11 percent , on the internet in 57 percent ) .
practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads .
experience requirements are generally associated with qualified professionals .
in terms of production and other executives .
in the working - class professions are mainly the mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or a plumber electrical equipment , said study author george tillner .
employers also in the middle of their ads state requirements for properties and skills of potential bidders .
like most of the required skills in advertising in the first place already emerging communications skills .
the employers require flexibility , adaptability and dynamism , autonomy , responsibility , organizational capacity and reliability .
a fifth of shopping centres is struggling with low attendance
it is clear from the data real estate advisory company cushman &amp; amp ; wakefield and jones lang lasalle .
in prague bohnice opens to the public the commercial centre of krakow , 19 of the prague shopping centre .
in the czech republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers .
unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 per cent of medium and large centres .
the main problems are inadequately large centre on the site and bad layout , too much floors or complicated and cumbersome arrangement passages , or dead space center , &apos; &apos; said michael soták from company cushman &amp; amp ; wakefield .
also , according to the head of the retail real estate jones lang lasalle sylvia samad , about one - fifth of the trade center struggling with low attendance .
among the main reasons include poor transport accessibility , low income category of local residents or overcapacity in the market place .
some of the projects opened almost fully occupied , but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory .
in today &apos; s customers are conservative and want to change their shopping habits .
the new trade center must try harder to attract &apos; &apos; of their customers to new brands on the market , entertainment , services and marketing events , &apos; &apos; said samad .
occupancy shopping centres is under soták generally stable , even in some centres is rising , as landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of the rent and dopronajmout some units .
`` but it is true that recently opened some of the projects that are not fully occupied and so reduce the average occupancy ( for example , breda &amp; amp ; weinstein in opava Šantovka in olomouc soták ) , &apos; &apos; he added .
commercial centres open in the past two years to promote market according to sylvia samad very slowly .
place in the market for new projects but there is .
the number of places for the construction of a successful project is very limited .
for example , in prague , we see scope for the construction of the project , which would serve the people of prague 6 .
certainly there is room for the construction of the smaller local projects , the so - called &apos; convinience centres &apos; &apos; , focusing on purchases and services for the daily needs of the population living in the immediate area , &apos; &apos; said samad .
also under soták exists on the domestic market place for another shopping centre .
and as for the small &apos; handler &apos; center , so for large projects in prague , or a medium - sized projects , or expansion in regional cities .
`` the city as kladno , ceske budejovice , brno or pilsen have room for further growth , &apos; &apos; added soták .
in prague sees scope for the upcoming shopping centre on winning the plaza , are also under him clear potential street in a ditch and wenceslas square .
`` vigorously develop expansion of retail parks , which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller and smaller towns in favorable rents and operating costs , space is also still in certain locations for smaller local or neighborhood shopping centers , or their reconstruction such as reconstruction commercial home prior , who benefit from good locations , &apos; &apos; said dita kubánková from company dtz .
in the czech republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centres , with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area .
a quarter of all the shopping center is located in prague .
among the 20 largest shopping centers , according to the number of tenants , nine of them are in prague , stems from the company &apos; s data incom gfk .
the number of shopping parks in the czech republic is below the eu average , compared with the values of britain and france is lagging behind the czech republic about 50 square meters per thousand people .

report : obama &apos; s campaign considered to replace biden for hillary clinton
the closest adviser to president barack obama , according to the new york times secretly considered to replace on the ballot in 2012 , vice - president joe biden , hillary clinton .
this revelation is the most important story impatiently awaited book on the 2012 campaign from mark halperina and john heilemanna `` double down : game change 2012 . &apos; &apos;
the times obtained a copy of the book , magazine and announced on thursday night , the president of the co - workers were held at the end of 2011 intensive group meetings and surveys to predict whether a waiver of the biden would help to revive the fading of obama &apos; s hopes for re - election .
according to national political correspondent for the times , jonathan martin , the book offers a thorough record efforts leading officials inside the campaign and in the white house , the former head of the white house office of bill daleyho , measured the effect on the elections should move the former secretary of state clinton to the post of vice president .
the potential change was a closely - guarded secret in the chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the oval office .
only a few of the president &apos; s closest advisers - including daleyho , former head of the obama campaign , jim messina , a former top advisers in the white house david axelrod and david plouffeho - known to be considering this change .
the book `` double down &apos; &apos; , says that daley was representative of the efforts to replace biden , despite their close personal relationship , and that by the time they finally decided not to implement this move , when data showed that adding clinton to the candidate would `` substantially increase the chances of obama &apos; s . &apos; &apos;
in an interview with martin daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing biden clinton .
`` i have studied all sorts of things , and this was one of them , &apos; &apos; said for daley .
do not forget that , at the time , he was president of the awful prospect , so we thought : `` jesus , what are we going to do ? &apos; &apos;
while daley characterized the research as `` due diligence &apos; &apos; , martin told anderson cooper of cnn that the campaign for re - election has made considerable investments , to determine whether this move in the elections .
`` during the campaign to interpret the kind of money on elections and qualitative research , if something is seriously considering , &apos; &apos; said martin on ac 360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team is considering this exchange .
martin told cnn that daleyho asked whether his then boss knew about this potential shuffling the cards .
while daley said that he did not think the president `` was aware of potential changes &apos; &apos; , a former office manager admitted that it was `` possible &apos; &apos; that obama knew about it .
martin added that the book `` double down &apos; &apos; definitely does not answer the question of whether political probe got up to obama on the table .
martin cooper asked whether he really thought that obama did not know about the research on biden &apos; s removal from the list .
`` maybe , &apos; &apos; martin said .
not so , mr hašek .
we have a unique opportunity , as a message to politicians that , as no .
there is a need to develop such pressure to martin hašek has been cleared of all political posts and left the mandate .
any other solution to reduce the level of political culture , which is already very slim .
martin hašek , zaštíťuje promise made , but everyone and especially policies must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what can promise .
confidence is the only capital , which has policies ( mr babiš has even the tangible , however , the question is whether the policies ) .
the best programme advocated a liar is untrustworthy .
in politics is no excuse , in politics is resigning .
mr hašek , if you are good with this country ( and your frequent declarations in the fortified , if you did not lie to you - you can see how it is with lying to the complicated ) , leaving the policy itself , like a man .
people then take your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and was responsible for her own responsibility .
otherwise , you will be seen as a spineless wimp , whose words or actions can not be trusted .
either you want to be proud , even though the errant man or a chicken .
maybe you think it is unfair , when addressing only to you , but you are the leader and they just misguided sheep .
and the leader of you and you have always wanted to be .
i understand that is now trying to bend the ears , regroup , bear the disgrace and then strike again , but such is the way of the guerrillas or dishonest .
you are , i repeat , in their eyes , the leader of the alpha male , then so be it .
accept responsibility and leave policy .
the black box in your car ?
while the american road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling motorway network , many are starting to see the solution in a little black box , which is easily fits into the dashboard of your car .
the device , which monitor every mile , who will miss the motorist , and transmit that information to authorities , are at the heart of the controversial efforts by washington and offices for state planning to renovate outdated system of financing america &apos; s main roads .
usually drab design motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations .
libertariáni met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for it , so that the government could use these little box , which would have recorded the distance travelled and maybe even where you go - and then use that information to the tax assessment .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil liberties union is also deeply distressed and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy .
and while the congress can not agree on whether to continue , some states to expect nothing .
finding out how during the next decade may move to a system in which the driver applies per kilometre road , which runs .
thousands of motorists already black boxes , some of which are using gps tracking , to take the test .
this is a real need for our nation .
`` it is not a matter of where we can not be choosers , &apos; &apos; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the association of state administration in southern california , the state plans to begin monitoring of mileage for each of the california motorists in 2025 .
changes to the way we pay these taxes .
we need to use this technology .
the stimulus is the fact that the road the trust fund financed by taxes that americans pay at gas stations , is at the bottom .
americans do not buy enough gasoline as before .
cars travel much more miles per gallon .
the federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon for the past 20 years .
because of the high price of petrol politicians are reluctant to raise a tax of one cent .
`` the tax on petrol just is not sustainable , &apos; &apos; said lee munnich , an expert on transport policy from the university of minnesota .
the state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test the system of paying for kilometre travelled .
`` in the long term , this seems like a logical alternative , &apos; &apos; he said .
experts called it a user fee in mileage .
it is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals , because the tax can be used to change behaviour patterns drivers which , for example , can help to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gases .
california &apos; s designers look to this system in planning strategies designed to meet the targets set in the ambitious laws on global warming .
but republican representative bill shuster ( pennsylvania ) , chairman of the committee for transport , said that it also sees a workable long - term alternative .
leaders of the free market of the organisation of the reason foundation are also in favour of the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled .
`` it &apos; s not a tax , which will disappear into a black hole , &apos; &apos; said adrian moore , vice president for strategy in the organisation of reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the initiative also support the two former american transport ministers , who in 2011 , urging congress to set off in the direction of paying for half a mile .
the u. s. senate last year approved a pilot project for usd 90 million , which should include about 10,000 cars .
the leadership of the house of representatives , however , rejected the proposal and have done so for fear of rural legislators representing the people whose day - to - day life often means offend many miles out of town for work .
a few states and cities , however , is moving forward on their own .
most ardent is oregon , in the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers .
these drivers will soon start the state to pay tax on the distance travelled , instead of taxes on gasoline .
nevada has already completed the pilot project .
new york just project examines .
illinois tries it on to a limited extent in the trucks .
and a coalition of i - 95 , which includes 17 state departments of transportation , along with the coastal states east ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) is studying how to implement the change .
this concept is not , however , the only champion .
in nevada , where it was recently device fitted with about 50 cars , the volunteers were drivers of concern that the government will be able to follow their every move .
`` concerns regarding the monitoring of big brother and similar issues were a major problem , &apos; &apos; said alauddin khan , who leads the management strategy and operations to the nevada department of transportation .
it was not something people wanted .
as the project went on , the american civil liberties union in nevada on their website warned : `` it would be very easy to turn this device to a full - fledged tracking device . &apos; &apos;
it is not necessary to build a ponderous technological infrastructure , which inevitably spread to the day - to - day trips and the arrival of individuals .
nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to monitor how many miles of driving the car , but not exactly when and where .
if you can , said khan , the public will be calmer .
the hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to small companies in california with the name of the true mileage ( the actual distance ) .
the company originally into action to help the government in taxation of drivers .
i wanted to break through in the emerging market with insurance liability , where drivers would not be paid on the basis of how many will take off .
but this device , which tested , drawing the attention of the planners of the road network , because using gps and adds only a limited amount of information , which are regularly recorded the modem .
`` people will be more willing to go , if taken their speed and their location , &apos; &apos; says ryan morrison , executive director of true mileage .
in some of these pilot programmes , a series of major errors .
they are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it .
in oregon , designers are experimenting with the drivers to make a choice .
they may choose the gps device with or without gps .
or you do not need to take any of the device and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all people in the state .
in other places , hoping to alert the public to the concept , if the device will be able to more , not less .
in the city of new york transport officials trying to develop the device , which would be equipped to moreover , it was possible to pay fees for parking meters , to provide insurance under the mileage and gathering data on the speed of other drivers , so motorists can avoid traffic .
`` motorists will be willing to go along with it because of the value of the benefits offered to them , &apos; &apos; says the design document of the city .
some traffic planners , however , would like to know whether any discussion about paying for a mile is not just a huge problem .
officials from the metropolitan transport committee in the san francisco bay area , they say that congress might problem is bankrupt road trust fund very easily solved by increasing taxes on gasoline .
one - off or annual tax could be levied on the driver &apos; s hybrid or other cars that consumed much fuel , so they will pay their fair share .
`` there is no need for radical surgery if enough to take aspirin , &apos; &apos; said randy rentschler , director of the committee for the legislation and public affairs .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy , and a lot of other things .
with a billionaire will next year on the phone ?
kellner , the owner of the ppf group , wants to buy the operator o 2 .
both companies confirmed the negotiations and , according to various sources of agencies and from behind the scenes , he said he had a hand in his sleeve .
notification of the transaction should come up in november , probably before the start of the auction frequencies for lte network , thus before 11 november .
kellnerův competitor karel komarek kkcg own group .
it is under the brand name sazka telecommunications to auction the spectrum for lte network .
and to everyone &apos; s surprise , in the meantime , the taste of the company into the telecommunications was discussed .
but sazka right now is a very experienced telecommunications veteran robert chvátal .
it began as a marketing chief mobile today ( t - mobile ) , eventually becoming director of the slovak t - mobile and the last time was in charge of the austrian branch of the same operator .
sazka plays several cards at once .
enlisted in the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for vodafone virtuála .
and it makes sense .
if he succeeds in the auction , to their networks will be able to move the existing customers from its virtual operator .
it would normally like vodafone , but according to the information economic newspaper that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies .
vodafone currently suffers from the competitive operators o 2 and t - mobile , who will be completely share their networks .
vodafone and needs a partner .
and that may be just in prague .
if it succeeds in the tender for the lte network ( as a freshman can auction the specially designed spectrum ) and vodafone in the auction is not necessarily , or he will not mind auctioning only limited spectrum ( not enough frequencies for all ) .
vodafone is the sazka may share on the network .
vodafone released sazka into his 2 g / 3 g network ( or newly built a network of lte frequency at 900 mhz ) , which will allow the firm to fast start network .
sazka between starts to build costly lte network , which will be able to use and vodafone .
not satisfied may be both companies .
the money saved would then vodafone could spend as a provider of fixed internet or cable television .
and kellner ?
that would buy the czech and slovak o 2 ( slovak branch is the daughter of the czech has immediately featured operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services .
but on the other hand , it &apos; s a big juggernaut , which will wait for the restructuring .
in the auction would gain lte network kellner , o 2 and very likely in conjunction with t - mobile .
both companies have declared that the network will share .
the auction could finally end a success , but probably not enough to high amounts to the state budget .
and from next year as customers in the czech republic could choose between calls with vodafone , t - mobile , kellner or komarek .
or the two titans of the czech business against the global giants .

the lawyer had feared that his drug addiction comes out .
liverpool crown court sentenced him to three years in prison .
a top lawyer , who informed the drug gangster about a police investigation , because he feared that his drug addiction , was sentenced to three years in prison .

the lawyer , whose nickname was `` bash &apos; &apos; ( party ) and the criminals who was hailed as the best legal representative , was after police monitoring scarborougha , which in previous proceedings involving narcotics represent , in 2011 , was arrested at his home .
the officers saw sarborougha ( 32 ) , as he left the house lawyer in blackburn in lancashire , who was at dinner with his colleagues from the law society , three bags of cocaine .
on the basis of tests in which they found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards , the investigation showed that ditta was regular user of drugs and class .
during a period of eight months from january to august 2011 , tried to tout to gather information about the arrest of two men in favour of scarborougha and his companion .
all four suspects were monitored as part of a major investigation of trafficking heroin and cocaine in the areas of cumbria , lancashire , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
after police arrested during a series of hauls heroin and cocaine worth about 1.5 million with 200 000 gbp in cash , in prison , together with them over the other 32 people .
ditta ( 42 ) passing information to criminals out of fear that they would come to his addiction to cocaine .
today ditta , who works with the law society forbes solicitors , based in blackburn , before liverpool crown court shameful moment when , after a three - week trial found guilty of that , in two cases , said the administration of justice .
during an earlier hearing was admitted to possession of cocaine .
the lawyer fall came after the police in scarborougha found that was in february 2011 in regular phone contact with ditta .
two detectives suspect tracked , recorded his arrival to dittova house , and saw him , as he placed the drugs on the purity of 60 percent below the lawyer basket in the black golf glove .
he was subsequently scarborough with ditta , who was at a dinner at the football stadium blackburn rovers at ewood park , in regular phone conversation .
the lawyer had returned home , where he found the drugs , and between the two parties had nine of the talks .
the court said that the find traces of drugs in the class , and in his hair , his wallet and to his credit cards and that ditta was `` regular user of cocaine . &apos; &apos;
ditta was later arrested , but denied the use of cocaine , and said that he spoke with the suspected dealer , therefore , that was his client , and argued that their conversation falls into the `` confidential communication &apos; &apos; .
during his arrest ditta took his wallet and tried to remove her from several credit cards , but all were detained and samples of hair .
in a police interview he said that ran the office at their home address and in the workplace , and that his clients because of work matters visited at home as well .
however , the court heard that after the arrest of key contacted a significant player in the drug supply chain , some of which had previously represented , to tell them what detectives know about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : `` who else is more aware that may not break the law than legal counsel in criminal matters . &apos; &apos;
mr ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer , and he got too close contact with a particular client .
the relationship , which we are talking about is not only about the drug dealer , but drug dealer , who had his own lawyer supplying drugs .
some of his interviews were no doubt legitimate because it was his lawyer .
but it has gone far beyond the current attorney - client relationship .
the police investigation of frustrating , as far as he could , to enable them to continue their criminal activities .
mr ditta his professional reputation brought on , the disgraced it .
with some of their clients are too close , particularly the scarboroughem , and allowed himself to be undermined its independence .
ditta wrongdoing refused and said : `` if i was a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and i would like to mr scarboroughovi submit information , i would expect 15 hours , but i would do it immediately . &apos; &apos;
after the hearing , however , police inspector lee halstead , from lancashire , said : `` mr ditta of counsel in criminal matters himself became a criminal when he began to get the drugs from organised criminals . &apos; &apos;
his addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leaders of organised crime groups that gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation .
legal representatives must stick to the principles of integrity in public and have inspired confidence and feel that they can rely on .
mr ditta betrayed that trust , and tried to hide behind the cloak of their professions .
unit for serious and organised crime in lancashire led against mr dittovi investigations , on the basis of which he was also sentenced to three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice , which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to all criminals , that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
we will find you and we will build before our courts .

obama is backing away from health care
after a wave of criticism of president obama yesterday stepped away from his often repeated and ambitious promise that `` if you like your healthcare program , you can keep it . &apos; &apos;
with reference to the hundreds of thousands of notification of testimonies from republicans in recent days , accused the president of misleading the american public .
obama yesterday from his original promise flinched .
`` the vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance , they can leave , &apos; &apos; he said in a speech in boston .
with regard to what he called `` rumors &apos; &apos; about the allegations in the media , obama called on americans who have received this notice , to search for new policies on the market .
most people will be able to have a better , more comprehensive healthcare program for the same price or even cheaper than expected .
`` you will get a better offer , &apos; &apos; he said .
his administration says that should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population , which he purchased insurance for itself , may be forced to change the program , because their insurance does not meet the requirements of the new law on the care available .
`` i say that these americans on the plane : you deserve something better , &apos; &apos; sebelius said in his testimony before the committee on energy and commerce in washington .
sebelius , who oversees the implementation of the law on the care available , said that the launch of the online market went from october `` miserable &apos; &apos; .
`` i am disappointed and angry as everyone else , &apos; &apos; she said .
i will try to regain your trust .
irritated sebelius this sentence , which was caught on microphone , spoke yesterday toward advisers seated behind her at yesterday &apos; s meeting of the committee , which was held after a heated exchange with billy long , a republican representative from missouri , which concerned whether it must also commit itself to obama &apos; s healthcare program .

the number of people infected with hiv in prague over a thousand
in the czech republic , the number of infected each year is rising .
for example , in 2002 the tests confirmed infection in 50 people , five years later , there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180 .
last year it was infected with 212 - a record number .
`` that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 , there is no doubt in my mind , &apos; &apos; said an expert on aids miroslav hlavaty , who for years led the prague house lights for patients .
according to him last year from january to september , in the country of 165 patients with hiv , this year over the same period there were 176 .
from the beginning of the monitoring by the end of september this year tests confirmed hiv in 1710 353 men and women , with most of the infected was in prague .
their number has reached in september 2005 .
according to the edge in the residence of 206 infected .
the diagnosis was interviewed and 156 people of south moravia , 130 of the moravian - silesian or 116 of usti .
at least the infected comes from the highlands , 19 .
a total of 88 percent of the patients were infected during sex .
fourteen people in the past had infected through blood transfusion .
such a case , but from the beginning of the testing , for more than a quarter of a century , in the czech republic .
with the hiv virus was born six children , beamed at them from the mother .
children should be learning the myths and legends like `` models for a way of life , &apos; &apos; says the author .
stories about thórovi may show that the `` brute force can match the clever trickery , &apos; &apos; while the arthurian legend reveal how important it is to have a dream .
a large part of the myths , `` for teaching at the school was too violent , too scandalous and in some cases too obscene , &apos; &apos; said crossley - holland , who advocates a selection of works from the appropriate age .
`` i think it &apos; s great that the myths and people &apos; s creation are already part of education , &apos; &apos; he said .
i said this plan for 20 years .
he added that the `` educational &apos; &apos; writers and teachers are in arresting the story with `` subliminal message &apos; &apos; for children , as a `` light switch . &apos; &apos;
crossley - holland , who translated from the anglo - saxon epic beowulf , who also writes the norwegian myths ( penguin book ) and the british national stories , says : `` you can have good intentions , but you will do better when you leave them for ourselves . &apos; &apos;
probably the biggest difference between adult author writing for adults , and adults author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope .
not that everything must be simplified or end happyendem , but there must be a natural sense of good and evil .
and that must be a subconscious ; exposed through the story , not openly .
the truth is that it &apos; s better to show than described .

from 2005 to 2007 , held at the station tv land show called `` sit down comedy with david steinberg . &apos; &apos;
the meeting will be held at the town hall in downtown manhattan .
`` this city is definitely in the comedic dna for larry &apos; s work , &apos; &apos; said steinberg .
he told me that when he &apos; s here , sometimes through an alley between two buildings and he says , &apos; man , if i lose all the money , maybe i will live here .
many things have moved , and is otherwise .
should the commentator pečinka spoke so that it could not agree , while the president Štěch fanning discord .
governor inmate i suspect as soon as he was elected to the presidency , and confirmed it .
the president sobotka always was , and is a symbol of the misery of democrats to continue .
other gentlemen demonstrated his weaknesses .
senator dienstbier is a principled and readable and applicable , vice - president of zaorálek is blocked most interview on tv .
on that basis , i do not see a better option than for democrats proposed for the vice - president , prime minister of the senate gajdůškovou , that one should not initial handicap , and i think i would have done , the standard of performance .
it &apos; s so good solution that hardly anybody at will .
add that this solution is the only way to forget what we did , and to continue without rupturing parties .
alena gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a blessing from president babiše and without people &apos; s , but with the epp minister for health hovorka , which is , in fact , the believers of social democrats .
this minimenšinová government should stability , because it would promote the proper law of the referendum and a committed to promoting and president of dawn okamura .
the president babiš finally progressing taxes resigned because he is smart and sees that it without her .
pp would bring problems because hovorka is a winner of the best of what they have , and the government would otherwise .
the same is true of , yes , there is a valuable minister , but when they do not want to enter into a reasonably risky government involvement , but will provide support , as well .
add the courage alena gajdůškové !

concerns about the safety of the mozambican escalates conflict because of strong personalities
beneath the statue samory machel , president of mozambique , founder of the center in maputo , thousands of people gathered for a rare public demonstration chanting peaceful slogans .
`` we want to back peace ; we want stability , &apos; &apos; said vanessa de sousa , executive director of the investment company .
out of fear for the future of their country exchanged business attire for the t - shirt emblazoned with the words , `` we want safe &apos; &apos; in portuguese and joined thursday to a crowd in independence square in the capital .
after two weeks came almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the party renamo , on one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement , more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once notorious rebel movements , initially supported by the white government in rhodesia , and then the government of apartheid in south africa in the efforts to destabilise the independent of the government of this country .
after a peace agreement in 1992 became an opposition party .
analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the country again broke into open conflict , but recent events scared foreign investors and local .
at stake is a rapidly growing economy , since the discovery of large - scale offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the north - west , over the next several years to bring the companies , such as brazil &apos; s rio tinto and vale , the italian eni and american anadarko , investments worth more than $ 50 billion .
the ruling party frelimo outside the dominant political force since 1975 , and renamo accuse each other of the tension .
the party renamo claims that the government has raised last conflicts that 17 september has launched an attack on their members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of party renamo .
violent assaults on the former rebels subsequently culminating when government forces attacked the base of the party renamo and attempted to kill afonsa dhlakamu , the leader of the group , told the financial times , spokesman for the party renamo fernando mazanga .
the government blames for starting the conflict renamo , because he had attacked the soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to ease fears of instability .
mr guebuza for the french press agency afp on wednesday said that mr dhlakama saw himself as a `` loser &apos; &apos; , who wanted to use `` whatever was left of his forces to try to prove that the government may impose its own decision &apos; &apos; .
so how frelimo outside renamo claims that they want to avoid war .
but fears of increased when , was quoted by mr mazangy that party renamo withdraws from a peace agreement in 1992 .
note the ft said that he meant that the party frelimo outside already agreement does not respect .
`` our goal is to return to the negotiations , but seriously , &apos; &apos; said mr mazanga .
previous talks between these parties have done to alleviate the tension between these parties , caused by a series of skirmishes in this year , just a little .
it is a skirmish between the two great personalities ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , said the lecturer at the open university and an expert on the mozambique joseph hanlon .
neither one of them is a good negotiator , and neither one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
the party renamo , which fought for electoral changes have already expressed that boycotted municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort to obtain the dying movement from the government and the financial benefits of the proceeds .
the election of party renamo since 1992 , while the new party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( dhm ) , which was founded by a former member of the party renamo , according to the expectations of their position in the election will improve .
mr mazanga says that mr guebuza - which expires next year , a second term - he wants to destroy democracy in this country .
`` i do not want a democratic system more parties , not transparent elections , does not want peace , because does not want to let go of the presidency , &apos; &apos; said mazanga .
it is unclear what the party renamo , but has carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and the south .
for most of the clashes occurred in the province of sofala , which is several hundred miles away from the capital maputo , but where is the city of beira port , which rely on mining companies , including companies rio tinto and vale , in its exports of coal .
in june the company rio suspended for about a week , the use of the railways , when the party renamo threatened that on this line of attack .
mr mazanga refused to comment on whether the renamo repeated his threat .
renamo wanted `` to warn the international community that the situation in mozambique is not good , &apos; &apos; said mazanga .
the instability of the increased frustration from the government , says fernando lima , head of the independent media company mediacoop , and many people also has concerns about corruption , the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings .
`` people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is borne entirely by the president and government , and that he should be , who will find solutions to problems , &apos; &apos; he says .
the protestor omar sultuane says that people just want stability .
`` no one cares or renamo , frelimo outside again , people just want peace , they want to have free access to the roads , &apos; &apos; he says .

aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of the seats , the stakes are large contracts
among the leading manufacturers of aircraft burst into a dispute about the width of the seats in the second grade for flights on long distance , which this month gave a bitter exchange of views on the air show in dubai .
the subject of dispute is the width of the seats granted on long - haul flights in economy class - not just the one would normally airlines , but whose allocated space is the key to claims for efficiency in the last aircraft offered by airbus sas and boeing .
airbus this week called for industry standards , which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class , but america &apos; s main rival boeing says you have to decide the airlines .
the dispute arose when the aircraft manufacturers to compete in the sale of the largest two - engined version of its long - range aircraft with potential a record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 november .
how is the back of the aircraft disintegrated - particularly whether it next to the 9 or 10 seats - is the foundation of the economic performance of claims on proposals for new aircraft `` mini - jumbo &apos; &apos; .
the company says that boeing 777 improved model `` x &apos; &apos; delivers 406 people in economic seats with more than 43 cm spread across 10 in a row .
airbus says that the competing version of its a 350 delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out at 9 .
the giant aircraft are often attacked each other in the technical issues through advertisements in the professional media .
airbus now before the air show in dubai , where he expects the 777 x takes advantage with more than 100 orders , calls directly to the public .
provisionally recently pointed out what may be the start of a new advertising war , when financiers pointed picture depicting three people in a crowded restaurant with the headline `` let you like it ? &apos; &apos;
`` boeing promotes long - haul flights in seats closer than they are in the regional turbo - prop aircraft , &apos; &apos; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
how to change the eating návky , people are more , but the seats on planes are radically changed .
since the beginning of the 1970 s , when a boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long - haul air travel , at the turn of the century , according to data from the ministry of health , the weight of the average american aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent .
according to us health statistics , the average american in the 21 st century over 100 cm .
airbus says that his rival is the concept of seats from 50 years ago , when the average width of seating newly baptized aircraft was lower .
airbus says that has carried out research which suggests that the extension of the seats on the 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep about 53 percent .
boeing airbus rejects the dimensions of the seats , and says that it is not in the power of the aircraft manufacturers decide how the airlines offsets the fees and equipment .
the company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on matters more than just the width of the seat .
`` it really is about to give airlines flexibility and enable them to do things they believe it has to do to be successful , &apos; &apos; said an expert in the area of kent craver .
they do not want to dictate what brings them profit .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for passengers is essential more space for his elbows , but for the supplier is a growing problem that may affect yields .
in this dispute is a race in aircraft orders , with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $ 700 billion at catalogue prices , enough to tip the balance of the american and european exports .
as stated in july , reuters , the distribution of seats is what drives the battle between the last aircraft .
both airbus and boeing argues that , in their recent proposals for long - haul twin - engined aircraft to 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment , the model of the boeing 777 - 300 er with 365 seats .
performance claims boeing depends in part on the design of the 777 x model compared with 10 seats in the series , and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row .
revenue in the unit cost is compared to 10 sedadlovému concept weakened .
`` the reason that boeing does is so loaded up with more seats , and made their aircraft more competitive compared to our products , &apos; &apos; said kevin keniston , leading to the comfort of the passengers on the airbus for europe .
on the other hand , analysts say that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with that many passengers is denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees .
`` forty - five inches wide seat for passengers would be great , but the reality is that , from a business point of view , airbus is motivated by the threat of 777 model , &apos; &apos; said an expert on cabin interior mary kirby , founder and editor of the runway girl network .
airbus and boeing supply seats , but offer airlines to catalogue the suppliers that can choose .
he travelled sellers aircraft even carries the band to check the competitive arrangement .
while wearing the comfort , all manufacturers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low - cost airlines and regional travelers .
the airbus a 350 offers a model with 10 seats in the series , but says that it still sold .
until recently , the airbus emphasised the need for greater adjustments to the cabin , so that it offered in some of its aircraft wider seats in the aisles .
experts say that without the support of a further large modern aircraft manufacturer &apos; s call for a new industry standards remain unanswered , but may deter waves from the sale of the 777 x .

`` it is premature and we really can not comment on it , &apos; &apos; said the director of communications of nova josef koukolíček .
according to information mf today is a significant release of the czech republic will miss , but by far the biggest impact should it have on staff positions cme branches in romania and other countries .
both new bosses nova christoph mainusch and michael del nina , who boarded after years of director adrian sarbuovi during wednesday &apos; s conference call with analysts talked about how they want to restrict all activities , which immediately connected with the tv business .

george kerevan : divided europe gives scots choice
another day , another ghost story about independence .
this time he appears , warning that the condition for membership of an independent scotland in the eu would be his entry into schengen .
it gave to stories on passport checks in berwick and barbed wire along hadrian &apos; s wall .
the truth is that the newspaper strathclyde to possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of europe , but - as expected - that the headline in the newspaper .
no one mentioned that the eu member states spends a lot of time to adjust their own laws , if it suits them .
whereas scotland now in schengen , offer continued non - compliance would be for brussels cheap concession in return for anything from scots really want .
so it &apos; s quite a story .
and so old that it would become a relic. canard that `` independence means passport control , &apos; &apos; i heard from at least 40 years ago .
yet in this tale of bearded one interesting idea .
why they should expect that an independent scotland will listen to europe ?
why change the yoke of london for the brussels , especially now ?
this is the real story : a great post - war plan to unite europe finally collapsed .
the effect of the crisis of the euro is the so - called project europe is officially dead .
across europe , the influence of the sacred to the opposition to the eu or the euro as a common currency .
even in germany eurosceptic party alternative for germany - based this year - came out of nowhere and federal elections in september had taken nearly five million votes , which from the bundestag essentially `` sweep &apos; &apos; of the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) .
at home he was always the opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , but became a decisive moment .
austerity dictated by germany and the european central bank , together with a straitjacket on the national economy by adhering to the common currency has led many to believe that europe had gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of greece .
rather , it is a system of the euro , which blocks of its members on exchange rates advantageous for german exporters - and german politicians want to leave .
without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency to southern europe in the area of domestic production compared to germany &apos; s disadvantage .
the only help is to cut public expenditure and revenue - which encourages germany .
for the current problems with the budget and currency is the deeper cause of the languid performance .
as a result of the `` green &apos; &apos; energy policy supported by brussels - code for the support of the french and german companies at the expense of consumers - the european industry twice more for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the united states .
this is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost , as we saw in the case of grangemouth .
not all the freezing salaries in the world would reverse zadupání the petrochemical industry slate of cheap oil from the us .
the result is a simmering rebellion , especially in france , once an enthusiastic supporters of the eu .
after the war , the political elite in france saw the eu as a tool that germany will not rein in paris and allow to stand in the world on a level of washington .
berlin but now paris as a badge of political legitimacy and asserted in europe does not need its own economic policy and battered the french economy to fend for itself .
the result : the right wing marine le pen , anti - european national front just won substantial additional options and relegated the ruling socialists in third place .
the queue is now with 24 % of the votes , the most popular party in france - early warning for uk labour that can not infer that fission right is automatically reflected positively on the left .
as le pen deals with its newfound popularity among the white working class ?
the european elections next year would like to use to across the european parliament has created the anti - european bloc against the common currency .
if the anti - european parties will result in these elections , which is likely , may be a block for the first time in the history of the european parliament to dominate .
`` i think that , for the foreseeable future , the growing anti - european feeling and attitude against the common currency and the euro will die .
the eu will not disappear , but it turns into something more rigorous in terms of `` europe &apos; s sovereign nations &apos; &apos; ) , has preferred to general de gaulle .
germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro , but france and southern europe will resume its own currency .
i expect that the united kingdom from this project will distance himself and moves to the united states .
but the increased interest in washington on the pacific suggests that britain will be left to the atlantic .
and where will it be scotland ?
we can choose to be areas ( in principle ) small england .
or we can defend their own economic interests - it is also a possibility to berlin and brussels , where we have to be .
i suppose that scotland would have resulted in a relaxed arranging a europe well , provided that it has retained its own currency .
cooperation with other like - minded countries would be easier in a federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should take a cue from norway and to keep their economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is - bizarrely - the most successful political movement promoting austerity measures in europe , which won a huge majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition &apos; s position against the cuts planned ( and implement ) labour chancellor alistair darling and the coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats .
it would be ridiculous , if scotland voted for independence , just to take the austerity measures imposed by berlin and brussels .
the parents of intersex children may choose the vague `` sex &apos; &apos;
germany became the first european nation , which recognises the third sex in children born with ambiguous sexual organs .
the new - born children are ranked only to either male or female gender .
the new law from parents required to provide for such children of either gender , and allows them to their birth sheets indicate sex as a `` vague &apos; &apos; or `` unspecified &apos; &apos; .
the law is to stop pushing for parents to be in your child &apos; s hastily opted for surgery to determine the sex , and the fight against those who are of intersex .
one of intersex person , according to the bbc , after many years , said : `` i am neither man nor woman . &apos; &apos;
i will stay patchwork created by doctors , bruised and scarred .
it is estimated that every year from 2000 children born one , nor is it a boy or a girl .
they are of intersex , part of a group of about 60 facts , which belong to the diagnosis of disorders of the sexual development , an umbrella term for those who are atypical chromosomes , gonads ( testicles or ovaries ) or unusually developed his genitals .
of intersex could be wallis simpson .
sex determination is not yet fully understood , but most of the experts in the united states says that if you can not determine the sex , it &apos; s better to use the best available information and to identify them , instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until they carried out the operation , if at all .
new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in identifying problems with sex , said that the new german law `` looks like a good thing . &apos; &apos;
of intersex children are an ethical dilemma .
`` some people are in a life - threatening condition that requires surgery , but in most of the children it is not so , &apos; &apos; he said .
determining sex can be made without the operation and then they can wait , as to the identity of the evolving .
knowledge of how the child will develop gender is not very accurate .
no one can answer the question of why this is happening .
it &apos; s a mystery why some people are gay .
the report submitted to the european committee in 2011 of intersex person described as different from transgenderových or transgender people , because of their status is not bound by gender , but on their biological structure that is not solely neither male nor female , but typically consists of both , and it can not be clearly defined as not one of them .
these features can occur in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle volume , hair , breasts , and the figure in the primary sexual characteristics , such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in the structure of the chromosome and hormones .
the report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by of intersex and transgender people in the field of work , and also the level of harassment , violence and prejudice .
the boys - no sex now have a special camp .
australia and nepal already allow adults described in official documents , male , female or `` third sex &apos; &apos; .
norrie may - welby , 52 - year - old australian , in june for the first globally recognised `` sexless &apos; &apos; person when he won the appeal to for the rest of his life to keep the status of `` uncertain &apos; &apos; sex .
according to the ministry of interior will have german passports in addition m ( man ) and f ( woman ) and the third , x , and that of intersex person .
in neighboring france , according to intelligence reports on france 24 issue of sex is still controversial .
in 2011 , dozens of french legislators in this heavily catholic countries signed a petition calling for it to have been removed from school textbooks `` theories about sex . &apos; &apos;
american website catholic online against german law also define and wrote : `` with the way the world is dragged to the new situation , where sex is a matter of choice , but not of sexual activity , we twist inside out two other pillars of civilization . &apos; &apos;
one mother of a newborn from maryland also said for baby zone that would rather see that children have allocated sex at birth .
`` parenthood itself is stressful without additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , &apos; &apos; said for web pages on parental care .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , the children with both male and female sex called hermaphrodites , according to the handsome , who had dual gender .
and about ten years the medical community believed that sex is something like a table , which can delete and repaint again .
but now many are questioning the ethical basis of operations that gender is a complex issue and doctors can sometimes decide incorrectly , because they do not know how because of their gender children can feel when they grow up .
`` in the middle of the 20 th century , it was called psychiatric emergency services , &apos; &apos; said drescher .
when these children born to call you a psychiatrist , but a surgeon .
persistent theories about how to treat children with ambiguous gender , was presented to dr john moneyem at johns hopkins university , who took the view that sex is manageable .
he created a new concept of `` sex &apos; &apos; and argued that the causes of social and environmental influences - as parents raised their child - were on a child &apos; s genes and hormones and shape the child , regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman .
but in one case of 1966 , known as the `` john / joan &apos; &apos; , his theory has become a contentious .
the parents of the boy , whose penis was damaged by poorly made circumcision , recommended that their child had a vasectomy , even removed his testicles and raised him as a girl .
`` the media has presented the case as a successful transformation of the case , but the reality was different , &apos; &apos; said drescher .
when the boy was 15 years old , he gave back to the boy and married to a woman .
in 38 years , however , committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors `` this model used today . &apos; &apos;
but in the 1990 s , with the advent of the internet , the surviving these operations have discovered `` dissatisfied with the outcome &apos; &apos; .
this was the case even bruce , 36 - year - old writer from montana , who was born with male chromosomes , but the ambiguous sexual organs .
doctors were not sure whether it has a large clitoris , or a small penis , and we believe that , as a man could never live `` a life &apos; &apos; .
and so shortly after his birth in 1976 bruce surgically removed external bodies and testicles , and was brought up as a girl .
in 12 years , the female hormones .
`` i knew that i was not a girl , &apos; &apos; he said on abcnews. com .
i was unhappy , but it was very hard to ask that .
at 18 he was sent to the plastic sheath .
but because he was depressed and i knew that something was wrong , he asked for medical records .
what he found was startling .
after the birth , i was sterilised and no one has ever said anything .
bruce was born with the disorder of sex ( dsd ) , which said the body to produce sufficient amounts of testosterone to properly develop his genitals .
after what he had learned the truth , turned back to the man took the dose of testosterone and remove the breasts ;
the operation had caused his infertility .
today represents another in an organisation called interface project and trying to normalise the perception of those who are of intersex .
but anne tamar - mattisová , director of the legal group for which informed choice ( advocates of an informed choice ) , based in california , is concerned that the german law `` calls for branding and stigmas . &apos; &apos;
`` many activists are concerned that the german law reaches that will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose the child for `` `vague , &apos; &apos; &apos; said .
we fear that it says for intervention .
we believe that it is better to allocate a male or female gender , and then wait .
but we do not know how the law will eventually lead , so all we can do is speculate .
tamar - mattisová said that her organization supports australian law , because `` it allows adults choose to be included in the third sex . &apos; &apos;
`` an adult should be able to make their own decisions on legally force of sex , &apos; &apos; she said .
german law is going to assign him at birth .
this is a battle in this time of a small child to seduce .
when they grow up , they can on their own to make their own decisions .
but dr arlene baratzová , radioložka chest from pittsburgh , who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group , said that the german law `` granted powers &apos; &apos; as parents and children .
baratzové daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but has called on androgen insensitivity syndrome dsd .
because her androgen receptors are defective , developed by katie &apos; s features .
he has a vagina , but not the uterus and ovaries .
it is now the 29 year - old katie married and in the studies at the university of pennsylvania , working as an intern at child psychiatry .
although it is barren , hopes to become a parent or through adoption , surrogacy .
`` the law gives parents some space to his decision to take their time , &apos; &apos; said baratzová .
it gives them time to carry out certain tests and think about it , and it gives them time to write `` the man &apos; &apos; or `` woman &apos; &apos; .
in this respect , it is all right - you are raising your child and you love it .
you have a wonderful child and celebrating .
you do not need to rush to the operations , which is irreversible .
`` it brings the opportunity to participate in decision - making and the child and withdrawing the anxiety that binds the parents , because they do not have the certainty that they are doing the right thing , &apos; &apos; she said .
finally , the child will decide how gender is more shares - and that is a great thing .
it gives children the power to make their own decisions .

karel drabek : uhlířský hill - one of our youngest volcanoes .
uhlířský hill is conspicuous hill 3 km southeast of towns .
along with several other is evidence of volcanic activity in the low jesenik at the time ( geologically recent ) .
the last eruption here were still at the beginning of the quaternary period .
when viewed from a distance it is at the top of the hill uhlířského striking a white stucco a baroque church of our lady of auxiliary , built in 1755 - 1765 .
it replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel .
the inn , who stood next to the church , had survived .
shortly after the completion of the church was discontinued lane of the four series , about 1 km .
the cross uhlířském on top is already the third version of the original , there stood in 1916 , the second , the 2001 lasted only until 2004 .
fifteen to stop are wooden sculptures , which manufactured the local artistic carver františek domel .
using a different species from the low .
similarly , the base of the rock of the area is an interesting geological exposure .
at each stop is also the name of the sponsor .
uhlířský hill is the rest of the young volcano .
although the data from radiometric measurements of old age a little different , the last eruption was about 1.5 million years .
it is , therefore , a younger than big roudný ( 3.3 million years old ) and older than the pinball volcano ( 0.8 million years old ) .
the volcano erupted in the explosion .
when it ejected a considerable amount of volcanic ash , along with fragments of rock from the bedrock , which acquired the reddish - brown colour .
in the conclusion of this phase poured onto the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous basalt to 13 feet of powerful .
the second eruption ejected red , russet and points to black tuff .
the film is powerful and 50 yards , and part of it is available in the wall of the quarry .
in a large volcanic tuff are conspicuous bombs to 1 meter ) and the second eruption was completed by the outpouring of lava .
at the conclusion of the activity of the volcano lava flowed , which now account for up to 50 m powerful layer struskovitého basalt .
the volcano , which replaces the gutting of volcanic ash and lava outlets are the most common type of volcanoes .
because they are actually composed of layers , were given the name stratovulkány .
the volcanic cone was subject to a gradual erosion .
he was , however , threatened to mining rock quarry on the south side .
the most intensive mining here was in 1953 - 1962 .
tuff ploughed into the concrete , which was then easier and better insulation properties .
mining is managed under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and to preserve this unique place .
the problem is , however , in a small rock porosity and cohesion , which quickly incorruptible , broke apart and slide down the slope .
the quarry so relatively quickly disappear .
to make matters even more complicated , it &apos; s warm , south along the slope of the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals .
correction is problematic , but time will need to select and maintain a geological profile .
it is nothing new , similar profiles are kept to a number of important sites .
on top of uhlířský get after green tourist sign of towns , possibly from silesian kočova .
motorists can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lime avenue , where even a short tourist trail .

this guy should get the death penalty as a nobody .
keep him alive ... no reason why keep him alive , it just is not .

pope appoints francis in february , the first cardinals
on thursday , the vatican announced that pope františek 22 february for the first time , the name of the new cardinals of the catholic church .
the cardinals have the clergy in the catholic church , the highest position right after the pope and are those who are elected pope , so francis will appoint his first group of men who will help choose his successor .
it is now the cardinals 201 .
however , once a cardinal reaches the age of 80 years , already can not participate in the election of the pope - group is diminishing at 120 voting will cardinals .

jack valero of catholic voices , said that the number of voting will cardinals in february was likely to fall .
he said that the pope usually called the cardinals as much as is necessary to increase the number of electoral votes again to 120 , and so the cardinals over age 80 years , how much he wants .
konzistorium next year will be significant , because it will be the first , after francis was elected in march of this year , valero said .
at the moment , there was some orientation in europe , and in particular italy .
`` it will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates the cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &apos; &apos; he said .
forty percent of roman catholics in south america , but they are only a tiny number of cardinals .
it will also be the first choice of cardinals since francis set the cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world , which he gave to the task of finding ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope all for himself .
`` now francis chose these eight cardinals to help him , &apos; &apos; said valero .
he said that it was `` quite possible &apos; &apos; that the cardinals pope asks for advice .
in this situation , but we were before - it &apos; s a novelty .
valero said that popes traditionally ennobled on the position of the cardinals bishops of the great places , but francis is `` full of surprises - so we do not know who is . &apos; &apos;

secret wars : syria , libya and iran .
training for obama , as has the bomb syria .
the american commandos in libya .
top gun in the persian gulf .
the israelis demonstrated exactly how to look like the bombing of syria .
without undue hype , threats and million statement sent aircraft , you hit the target and returned .
without leaving lulled by the official disposal of chemical weapons in syria .
the whole event refuse to confirm and had to do .
the exact opposite of confused and mall , unsupported by obama &apos; s syrian policy .
and most satisfying to its attack was what the israelis bombed .
do not be fooled by the media of their assertions that was bombed syrian `` base &apos; &apos; or `` deliveries for hizbaláh &apos; &apos; .
recently , i wrote here that , while the us aid secular rebels in the country remains a rhetorical plane , so russia blithely supplied weapons to syria .
a fresh supply of russian missiles landed in the port of latákija has become the target of israel &apos; s raid .
the clear message .
and note , israel again bombed assad &apos; s regime , not the rebels , though that according to popular web theory should be the opposite .
the us government with 2 members spaciálních units , possibly delta force .
he did not know until now that had distinguished themselves during the attack on the american consulate in benghazi .
it is not a heroic death two former member of the seals , who defended the cia in the city , to me it was a secret cia members of the squad , which is made up of former soldiers .
for a long time there was speculation about the seals in the consulate or even located elsewhere in the mansion of the cia .
it is now clearer .
in any case , the information that the cia has in libya , his office protected machine gun nests ( it was at one of these two members of the seals were killed by a mortar round ) , is quite surprising .
but even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes .
they were part of the american commandos in tripoli , and as soon as we got a report on the attack in benghazi voluntarily come forward to intervene and together with five private contractor shot their way into the cia in benghazi .
the obama administration bungled the fact that , during the attack was not the same squad deployed officially and all , and that is simply hesitant about what to do .
the squad leader , so no orders to release these volunteers .
anyway , that in the country is not a one - off , but the american commandos , the cia agents and private contractor is quite an interesting information .
given that , until recently , not officially acknowledged that , even now , just talking about a consultancy the nato mission in libya .
but it is good that the us even when half - heartedly trying to fight terrorism in libya .
even if a national to resolve the situation , it wanted to help more .
the last part of the secret and enduring conflict today i want to write the coast of iran .
not so long ago , the media almost sung the iranian air force for the prosecution of american drones .
few , however , it is not known how the americans their drones effectively protects .
of course , if you can find the drone in its airspace , there is nothing to do with it .
however , if the iranians drone was discovered in the area of the international situation is completely different .
and so it was that the iranian aircraft f - 4 phantom pursued the american drone in international airspace over the sea , which was perhaps the first american a super f - 22 raptor in history .
the hull phantoma to visually verify its equipment , without him phantom registered on the radar or just noticed and then suddenly appeared at him and called on the iranian pilot to return home , the unquestioningly obeyed .
no wonder , when the phantom is an american manufacturing , but who remembers the war in vietnam .
with raptorem can not compare .
the court to block the regulation on the stopping and searching people police departments in ny
a federal appeals court on thursday to block the court order demanding changes in the stop and search people at the police department in new york and the judge in the case .
the us federal court of appeal said that the decision of judge shira scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on the appeal , which the city was lodged .
judge in august , decided that the city had violated the constitution that has carried out its programme of stopping and questioning people .
the city of its conclusions and its corrective regulation , including the decision to allocate supervision , which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training programme .
the appeal court heard arguments on tuesday for the postponement .
the appeals court said that a judge must be to withdraw from the case because it is in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge , and that a judge acted as a requirement to avoid the appearance of bias , partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statement , which openly responded to the criticism of the court .
the judge decided that the police officers of violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , when it was wrongly focused on blacks and hispanics in the context of its programme to stop and search people .
establish an independent supervision , to oversee the reforms , including changes in procedures , training and supervision , and ordered the pilot programme for the purpose of testing camera worn on the body in some areas where there is often stopping people .
in august , the city of new york approved the methods of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search .
the justification for the appeal of the city is scheduled for sometime after 14 march 2014 .
the tactic of stopping and searching people have criticised a number of defenders of civil rights .
there is some form of stopping and frisking people for about a decade , but reported searches under the administration of the independent mayor michael bloomberg &apos; s dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011 , in most cases for blacks and hispanics .
in 2004 , wrote the four men , who all belong among minorities , the action , which became a case of collective actions .
supporters of the changes the stopping and searching people conducted by the police department in new york , argues that the changes to end the unfair practices , will increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures used by other police departments .
opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale , but no crime , and that the money will be wasted , but will not solve the broader problem when the police force under pressure after over the last decade have reduced its numbers of several thousand people .
judge said that put an end to the practice of stopping and searching people , which is a constitutional reform , but the way in which the examinations of the police department in ny introduced .

i am here but subsequently finished , because he was sitting on a branch of someone who could not complete the registration of the internet .
and because i did not want to go to another branch , registration , then i moved out , and it made me change the address and identity card number .
when i wanted to complete the registration later , i was told that , because i have a different number , address and it just is not complete and that i had to request the removal of data and make new registration .
i did that and 24.10.2013 i wrote on the technical support that i am asking for the removal of all of your personal data from the database under existing law on the protection of personal data .
to this day she wrote me duhý technical support to complete the registration at the branch .
thus began a marathon of e - mails on technical support , where , after the 4. urganci 25.10. wrote that personal data , at my request , erased .
the man then said that he could make the new registration and here again problems soon i wrote that my user name is already busy ( i was deleted - not a personal data , but eventually dismissed this as well ) .
i used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal data are already stored , to complete the registration at the branch ( both may have saved something argues that erased ? ) , i contacted again the technical support .
my question is , how can i write off that personal data actually erased 25.10. and to have sent an e - mail with the mistake .
this i did yesterday ( around 15 hours ) , and to me that today written that i saw the same day ( 31.10.2013 ) 13.22 and that therefore it can not be , because i used the same name and date of birth .
what that technical support contact already week and with them that it still is .
and what about that , if it were true what claims ( he is not ) could not register no one with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered .
just by the way in those 13.22 i actually registered in the same name and date of birth , but i used the invented e - mail and telephone number and wonder of wonders , appeared to me that the page on my e - mail sent a link to complete the registration .
but how can this be possible when they can not be registered in the same name and date of birth ?
i think because it binds tipsport holder to e - mail and telephone number and date just knock as he claims .
so again , i told this to technical support that simply lie ( either intentionally or do not know and what they write ) , because what you write is not true .
i support of several screens that the problem with the registration was before 31 october so `` false &apos; &apos; registration for this simply is not affected .
to me that tipsport wrote off stiff sentence - i am sorry , but that you have already registered again , we can not check your statement .
and communication .
and repeated the same thing over and over again , that the registration of a name and date of birth .
they can not accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e - mail , and so they do not run .
if it is , not only tipsport that erased the data as it claims , but still lying when he said the opposite .
the worse is that it can be easy to prove how they lie and trying to make it look like he is the error on the part of the customer .
by the way , after placing this matter on my personal blog things into a bit of movement and technical support came from the e - mail that the matter be transmitted to review and will be informed ( after a week of urgency and haggling and warnings on the same mistake ) .
the killing of us , but we are innocent , defends the leaders of the khmer rouge
nuon chea was number two in the hierarchy of the khmer rouge , and khieu samphan , the former head of state .

fantastic ice cream to glow in the dark ?
the british businessman made the first ice cream to glow in the dark - using a jellyfish .
charlie francis used fluorescent properties of the marine animal , and developed a luminous delicacy .
the idea came when he read the professional treatise on jellyfish , and persuaded the scientists in china to chemically produced a protein that causes the phosphorescence .
this ice cream reacts with the language of the eater - increases the ph of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation .
chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth , and therefore , the more lick , the more september .
charlie , the founder of an ice cream company `` lick me i am delicious &apos; &apos; ( licked me taste great ) , says : `` it &apos; s an amazing stuff , but in terms of production , we are at the beginning , so for £ 200 you get about 2 g of this substance . &apos; &apos;
protein that we use in the ice cream , reacts with your tongue at neutral ph .
so how does your mouth protein warms up , increasing the ph and ice cream begins to shine .
we tested it over the last few months , and it seems to be a great idea for a halloween , because the causes of this fantastic brilliant effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream , i have ever made , because the glow of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .
and so every hillock costs about £ 140 .
but it tastes good .
charlie &apos; s experimental company based in bristol , is known for its traditional flavors of beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
his other product is to be but even more ambitious .
he says : `` i really wish i make an invisible ice cream . &apos; &apos;
in essence , it &apos; s impossible because of the effects of light caused by ice crystals , which consists of ice cream , but i reckon that with some way to do it , we will .
ice cream using fluorescent jellyfish properties , artificially produced by chinese scientists .

dr. martin about the problems with the olympic games in sochi communication with the russians is demanding :
the corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile and then just take a deep breath : `` it &apos; s tough . &apos; &apos;
cooperation with the team of organization of the olympics in sochi 2014 according to dr. martin is a little more complicated .
on what was on the last olympics , we can not forget .
`` nothing works as well , &apos; &apos; says the boss of the czech olympic mission .
what , exactly , is it ?
many things are going more slowly and not exactly .
it &apos; s a confusing .
from the point of view of the invoices are relatively fast , from the point of view of supplying information about material things not so much .
they might have three months to pry delivered to us , as will be officially marked the village , so that we could do a whole range of things .
we are still waiting , and they still say that the thing they communicate .
in a number of things still communicate .
it is now at least finished the olympic village ?
but it &apos; s not catastrophic situation .
a month ago , we were at the empty rooms .
fortunately , the house is worth .
what does that are empty ?
they are to be finished the floor ?
the concrete , such was the month before .
but they still have time .
even if there is a danger that , until 26 january as a vanguard arrive , there will still feel the glue .
and if we were not , so what ?
president putin would mean giving the army ?
so it probably will .
only it was not that the olympic village = potěmkinovy village .
rather , there is a risk that they will not make such adjustment disorders , finish the details .
maybe they will have the way in this state , that we are going to have to take the boots of the london games .
but i believe that somehow it together .
how many of the czech sports people could go to sochi ?
now there is roughly 78 , although depending on the nomination criteria that number changes .
maybe skaters probably would be at the trinity , what was left .
about rychlobruslařce martina sÁblÍkovÁ also need no doubt , but otherwise it is in development .
still awaits you trip to sochi ?
no , if nothing happens , i should go there to 26 january .
how will look like houses in the olympic village , we know .
even some of the things we have ourselves to plumb the subway to not only drawing .
we are also a number of other things , including transport .
and what does the boss of a hundred days before the olympic games ?
i am preparing to the annual evaluation of the olympic sports , plus i am doing routine agenda in terms of communication with the organising committee in sochi .
instead of the post - election beef stew post - election
october elections rather than the winner has brought a bunch of losers .
it is not only the parties to the house of commons or not ( e. g . spoz ) , but also the previous government parties ( ods , top 09 ) , and eventually the democrats because of its internal dissension .
politicians will place a sirloin served on the weekend of the post - election stew .
springer elections became the movement of andrei babiše voters , which promised to change the political style of government .
the fragmentation of the election result and dissension in the winning side plays into the political ( of ) the will of the president milos zeman regardless of the wishes of voters who side , which president zeman publicly supported , not elected to the house of commons .
president : because of the unpleasant events lost strategic ahead of other policies , but there are still a number of ways to get it back - for example , the future prime minister .
while the democrats &apos; chances of obtaining the prime ministership in my eyes away , the trader andrew babišovi instead approaching .
the post - election development is not yet miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government , but compared with the pre - election scenario of a left - wing government democrats supported the communists , this is for the development of business in the czech republic , and thus the economy not only better news .
due to the loud opposition will get together with the cdp or top 09 , is still the most likely scenario coalition of democrats , yes , and the cdu - cpp ( a total of 111 mps ) .
given the schism in the democrats , which has thus become unreadable and a pit in the negotiations , may be the result of coalition negotiations rather depressing for democrats .
the minority government democrats lodged with `` nezemanovců &apos; &apos; at the castle probably get away with it .
in addition , any government that democrats will participate , will be jeopardised unmet ambition of many of the social democrats , which may lead to further sooner or later a schism in the party .
so , i ask myself : `` `` unassisted back to another early elections ? &apos; &apos;
another option would have been rather a referendum on the strength of the voters &apos; mandate movement , yes .
plans for the democrats on the sector , raising taxes , higher taxes on income or the building of the state bank fell hopefully under the table .
the democrats , yes , the cdu - cpp and dawn , on the other hand , for example , agree to promote entrepreneurship , moderate fiscal policy ( government deficit below 3 % of gdp ) to promote employment disadvantaged people , a reduction of the lower vat rate on selected goods .
friction is the most experienced in perspective on social policy and the size of the state .
it has now but on top of that , so the program so far , most likely coalition yes , democrats , the cdu - cpp , leaning more to the right .
which , in my view , is a better result than left - wing agenda with taxes on everything in the economy was still moving .
more recently , it seemed that the majority of citizens in the czech republic wanted early elections .
as the reasons have been given corruption , wasting money on extravagant purchases and government procurement , raising taxes and government scandals .
according to the results of the elections may conclude that the majority of the citizens of this state .
it really did not matter , and the state who was here ( theft and debt that state ) , were not satisfied .
otherwise i can not explain that 3 413 497 voters came to elections , 596 357 voters elected top 09 384 174 ods voters voted for a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original ruling coalition , which represents 52,16 % of all legitimate voters .
which is an absolute majority .
when the parties count 1 , 016 829 voters democrats , then with the old order ( because of all the parties involved in the `` theft &apos; &apos; and the debt that state ) , then this situation actually agreed 64,23 % of legitimate voters .
this , in fact , the majority of voters made it clear that they are not to punish the guilty rozkradení and over - indebtedness of this state .
or do you think that members of the democrats , who are involved in this work for the appropriate laws ?
we did not help ?
olomouc opens in the historic center of public rink
the organizer of olomouc christmas markets and winter skating pavel burned , said that preliminary work on the rink started 26 october and from wednesday &apos; s operation in aggregate production on the ice .
the ice layer is already strong seven inches and into friday morning area will be ready for the first visitors .
the rink to 375 square feet , took the podium 358 square meters .
skaters and passers - by will be also available two stalls and punch .
`` we expanded floor area , boosted the area in front of the stands and almost the entire area is roofed podium to skaters could easily not change , &apos; &apos; described the charred .
the streets of olomouc already like christmas .
last year it was the rink for a revision of the lower square installed directly in front of the main entrance hall at the top of the square .
correction to the square was completed at the end of the summer , so the ice could go back to his original position .
for the first time , people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009 , when the rink was in operation from january to march .
ice will then become an integral part of christmas markets in the city .
christmas markets , which is part of the rich cultural program , will be at the top of the square began the month before christmas .
scientists more light , as the movements of the tail is linked with the mood of the dog &apos;
previous research has shown that dogs more joyful wags transport ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs are waving their tail predominantly left .
now , however , scientists say that the other dogs can these subtle differences in the movements of the tail of record and respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , neuroscientists from the university of trento said : `` in humans , it is well known that the left and right side of the brain linked to have different incentives that create a positive or negative emotions . &apos; &apos;
the same thing we were trying to discern for other species .
he added that , as with people , even in dogs is the right side of the brain responsible for left - handed movements and vice versa , and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotion .
in an effort to get more information about how the dogs react to the lopsided wiggling tail other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals that watching movies on the other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of these animals and analyze their behaviour .
perhaps it will not be too long before we understand why it is their tail sometimes on the one hand , and on the other .
professor vallortigara said : `` we have reflected the dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version , or in the form of silhouettes - to get rid of any confusing initiatives , and we have also adjusted the movement of the tail and represent it more to the right or the left . &apos; &apos;
when the animals have seen otherwise mediocre dog move tail transport ( from the point of view of the dog &apos; s tail vrtějícího ) , remained totally at peace .
but when the recorded video of the tail of predominantly left ( again , from the point of view of the dog &apos; s tail vrtějícího ) , their heart rate has increased , and the animals seemed uncertain .
professor vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs through these movements knowingly communicate with each other .
rather , he believes that the dogs had learned from experience , which moves to and which need to be careful .
he said : `` if several times to meet with dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly manner and move right produces less friendly manner , you react on the basis of this experience . &apos; &apos;
the researchers say that the findings may owners of dogs , veterinarians and trainers to help better understand the emotions of their animals .
an expert on the behaviour of dogs john bradshaw , a university teacher of veterinary medicine at the university of bristol , said that it was not the first study , which examined the left and right side for dogs .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln found that dogs turned his head to the left , when watching aggressive dog , and to the right , when looking at the jolly dog .
and in another essay specialist from the university of victoria in canada , said : `` the dog robot dogs more likely to show when the tail wagging the left than right when he became more insecure - quite the contrary to the italian study . &apos; &apos;
the difference may be given to him by dogs in these different studies of animals in the movies or dog robots talking quite like dogs .
he explained that might help studies on how dogs respond to the real dogs .
`` although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details are still to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception , &apos; &apos; he said .
but given how easy it is to record their behaviour , probably will not be long before we can understand why it is their tail sometimes on the one hand , and on the other .
rbs suspends two traders with foreign currency
according to two people familiar with the situation suspended the royal bank of scotland ( rbs ) two traders in their division with foreign currency , which is another sign that the global investigation control authorities regarding the shady things with currency market is becoming more common .
some of the world &apos; s biggest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that , together with the relevant authorities on the investigations of the largest financial market in the world , where every day amending the owner of 5.3 trillion .
these two traders would be the first rbs staff suspended in the context of an expanding investigation , which is a response to the scandal of manipulation of libor ( london interbank interest rate ) .
the bank declined to comment on the suspension , but confirmed that this month received a request for information from the authorities .
`` our continuing investigation in this case continues , and we fully cooperate with the fca and our other authorities , &apos; &apos; said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , the people who are close to this event , said that rbs had forwarded the british financial conduct authority records of e - mails and instant messages sent from the accounts and accounts of the former trader .
the businessman , richard usher , left rbs in 2010 , and it is expected that was released from his current position of the president of the foreign currency trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , the chairman of the trade for cash in citi , took a vacation this week , while matt gardiner , former head of the trade in currencies in the barclays and ubs , was this week suspended by standard chartered .
not one of these traders had not been accused of any wrongdoing .
the group of mr usher for sending instant messages were bankers from barclays and citigroup , told people to this event .
the bank ubs this week said that after the swiss inspection body finma , announced that he had been investigating suspicious machinations on the market with the foreign currency in several swiss banks , has taken action against some of its staff .
globally , at least six offices - the european commission , finma , the swiss antitrust authority weko , fca , the ministry of justice in the us and the monetary authority in hong kong - examines the claim that these bankers banded together to move with the currency market .
people familiar with the situation said that hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also launched an internal investigation or from the competent authorities have received a request for information .
banks are combing the years old with quick messages and e - mails to find cases of some offences .
reports of investigations scared traders in the area , which has been one of the largest engine for profit in the accounts of the investment banks in the past few years , but which was disturbed by a small currency volatility limited opportunity for speculators .
some bankers are trying to reduce the severity of the situation when he argued that with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency is virtually impossible , but senior traders say that it may not be true .
a senior trader said that , despite the large volume of daily trading foreign currency dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and increasing banks use their own internal platforms means that `` you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices . &apos; &apos;
the report came on the same day that the company credit suisse announced that this week dismissed from his department for trading in shares of a trader who at the end of last year , has caused the loss of nearly 6 million usd .
the bank immediately alerted the authorities and cooperated with their supervisory authorities .
`` we believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved , &apos; &apos; stated by credit suisse .

nap : i want a contract in the nhl .
the juice , lust and enthusiasm i still
for you slept through it was always the first family , because she wants in his 38 years to fully comply .
either he gets a job overseas and to extend his career , or with hockey finally ends .
`` i want to play the role of my dad and husband . &apos; &apos;
`` i am looking forward to it , &apos; &apos; says hockey player , still waiting in vain to offer .
despite this , that this is the guy who never nothing around here .
despite the fact that , on the ice on the heart and it could drag down teammates .
also , despite the fact that he was in the last season the most productive player in columbus .
`` but the desire to show everyone is still in me , &apos; &apos; he says firmly .
there may be , allegedly on the standing of the new york rangers , who got into the season and they have wounded two mainstays of the attackers - rick nash and ryan callahan .
how did your arrival into the rangers look like ?
they are just speculation .
until i have something on paper , so it is worth a look .
i know that came out of the article in the new york post , that i would have to sign it , but that &apos; s all it is .
there was delivered , that is what really happened .
unfortunately , i wish to announce that i have a contract , but that &apos; s just the way it is .
nor are you from the club ?
such communication in the nhl takes place every day .
there is about to get into a situation where the treaty will come .
when the player to be hurt or someone &apos; s and team ever .
there &apos; s a lot of different factors that must meet together to get the contract .
but in new york just similar circumstances arise , no ?
wounded is rick nash and ryan callahan and the team came into the season , so there is a chance , do not you think ?
of course , there &apos; s always a chance .
but the second thing is that you always need two parties .
today i should take a lot of offers , but so far i have not got one .
this is , unfortunately , a reality in which i live .
on friday , you will leave in america , you are in the expectation that something could go smoothly ?
i have the expectations of 5 july , when the nhl opened with free market players , and still nothing .
are you going to new york to be reminded ?
it would not , i am going to tampa for the kids and a wife .
i look forward to the sun and to see you again .
somehow you have planned their programme ?
it &apos; s a given that i am the husband and father , and from it all depends .
now i am no hockey player - i have no contract and playing games .
so i will play the role of my dad and my husband and i am looking forward to it .
on sunday has vašík two hockey games , that &apos; s for me and my whole family holiday , when we can go to support our children in what they want to do .
do you think that you could do this in quotation marks on full - time ?
yes , you can think about a lot of things .
and this may be the case .
i tested it three years ago , when i missed 50 games because of knee surgery .
and too much and i enjoyed it .
once it gets to a stage that all the goals , victory and throws you replace it , what you have at home .
because the family and kids , it &apos; s the meaning of life .
whatever you do , what you want .
i had a job , which was the most beautiful me except the family could meet .
you had a lot of offers from europe : you have got it , you want to play the nhl just because it is the nhl , or is it because of the family , that you want to be in america ?
as a hockey player , so in the first place - in addition to the family - including sporting success .
the nhl is the best competition in the world .
and from the stems and family life .
my children , so sorry , our children - my and my wife - grew up in the states , began to go to school there , and so on .
and we would be very happy if this trend continued .
because what we tell ourselves in america are options elsewhere .
that chance should offer them .
so you are planning to stay in america permanently ?
we will practice as now .
this means that , in the summer , we will be in the czech republic on deep in and around budweis .
in winter and again in tampa , or where we put our steps .
it &apos; s not the ideal , be still warm .
i was very lucky in my life .
you could say that i met him , it was a lot of strength and self - denial and it took me a lot of things i missed .
but hockey in return offered plenty of opportunities , and this is one of them .
that a woman can choose where we live .
the world is full of people who are hungry after this , so that they can choose what they do and how they live .
how long had you have in your age will work , train hard and wait for an offer ?
yeah , yeah , that &apos; s a question i can not answer .
today it in myself , i still have the juice , the lust , the enthusiasm , the passion for the sport. the desire and motivation to prove to people that you have still got to the nhl , that i was still better than anyone else .
but i can not say how long it would remain there .
it &apos; s the plan .
so you could say that this season will wait , as it turns out , and then you decide what next ?
i am at the stage where i am coming from day to day .

described cases , however , do not provide an answer to the question of where the affection of some journalists to zemanovcům takes - whether it is a response to a direct order , or , to use a vulgarism , typical of an impertinent empathic - friendliness .
and while we expect the general rottenness , can not resist the question whether the change in the tv do not seek other , equally unscrupulous power interests , which has yet to get an opportunity .
the truth is , those who say that in developed countries to the obvious attempts at intervention politicians in the broadcast .
the truth , however , is that it does not mean that there were complaints to public media .
the complainants call into question their independence .

to be choked hatred
the writer vaclav kahuda after 12 years of back to writing .
after long years , where he lived , but he read , write , václav kahuda ( 1965 ) , the new novel by the wind , dark presence .
that will not work on a slim volume , suggests the number of pages of comparable with his most famous work scrum ( petrov , 2001 ) .
for salon kahudu confessed , another prominent czech writer currently - emil hakl .
what is moved , that you are after 12 years of silence he wrote a novel ?
i did it - to be choked hatred .
see around still new and new clones of human folly of pettiness , young organisms disabled blind selfish endeavors .
not even talking about us older , faces bereft of helpless craving vekslácké soul and conversely přepólovaní ideologues who are trying to sell with an expression of small hookers to sell its `` product &apos; &apos; .
at the start of the millennium , i bought a small digital camera and filmed his jurodivé friends , eccentrics and secret services .
i am not now .
sometimes i feel of life on this planet &apos; s brain .
like to go for a walk and then in the evening light reading books .
you are talking about the sense of doom , hatred .
he was somewhere in the past a break , which affect you , or too old , just like all of us ?
there &apos; s a long time ago , roughly in ten years .
if it did not have a name .
well , and after that i lived .
there is still surprised by the quiet boy .
i see more isolated clackers , everybody in the tornado of anxiety .
saved me writing books .
i am taking part in this huge , thousands of years of continuous movement system of life on this planet - the birth of the intangible future .
the immense , breathtaking complexity of life , when every stone is the direct beneficiary of our presence .
the players we are sad and beautiful game , when the attempt - a mistake the next and the next generation of being in the interaction trillion per second creates a superhuman , artificiální intelligence .
twelve years is a relatively long period of time .
picking up his post as a continuous process , or are you just started from scratch ?
talking to herself , or better , the dialogue , which leads right and left half of the brain , sometimes floats and formed in the book .
as a period of peace are laced with sleeping quietly metastases wars , which is perhaps one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence , dressed in the words .
i felt my dumb an avalanche of life is growing in the brain , and if i can not do anything , so i quietly one day collapse .
it is a set of issues that shaped the brain and by the classes , which are stored in the dark `` beneath the surface of consciousness &apos; &apos; .
neocortex , gray matter , says older evolutionary services , goes to the ancient tree ring of the brain .
talking to the furry creatures , says the snakes , looking for the answer in the flight of birds , raise their eyes to the clouds in the sky .
yes , the moral law within me and starry sky above me .
finally , the brain wonders of the world .
the relatively often express the egos of metaphorically - could you define biologically ?
the brain stores in their billion communications and electrochemical links all the memories , the experience and the experience that the man in question had lived .
this forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees information , registers of memory , brain uses in its recognition , cognitive , process , being exposed to the constantly changing presence , in constant efforts to try to identify and understand their surroundings and decode important communication .
sometimes there are problems of congestion .
by analogy - like a `` hit &apos; &apos; pc , from the speech emulator and translator from foreign languages you messed up first in the operating environment , such as windows , and after a few failed restart ended up in dark green fluorescent screen bios , in the basic system , which manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard , cpu and memory , etc .
for those who have not yet understood what he was talking about - i am talking about psychospirituální crisis .
you speak of her often - why do not you just this type of recourse regularly interested ?
because it &apos; s the pit .
so far , the functional mechanisms in our thinking , feeling and behaviour - there is a gap .
there &apos; s a good quote nietzsche : `` so long staring into the abyss , when he looked into the abyss . &apos; &apos;
genuine feeling - that is , if you lost all hope disappears , mentally `` die &apos; &apos; and new quality .
and why it interests me personally ?
i will answer parable .
once one fell into the water and drowning , ran for days , months and years , he still drowning and reading , and the books have taught him to swim - live .
he became `` underwater &apos; &apos; .
perhaps someone will help me a written sentence , as once helped hrabal texts me .
to what extent do you think the readers , to a man who will read your text ?
the one you can not tell anything meaningful , one call it knowing more ego , but it seems to me the best characterized the arthur rimbaud in a letter to a friend :
`` i was somebody else - that the reader directly engaged in the process of the formulation of words and phrases . &apos; &apos;
from an early age he had read books old czech fairy tales , sailed in the submarine captain nemo , running after stínadla in dark alleys .
eventually , all branches of authors and their message is clear : `` the sun worlds other karla hynek macha . &apos; &apos;
and when the book is out there ?
you care to the reader &apos; s opinion ?
on the rebound that to you over the people who read the book , get it ?
of course , it depends on the opinion of the people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text .
and even then , i need to , after years on the street randomly contact and thank me , that i had a book to help in some of their heavy environmental decision .
the books are in fact `` lives &apos; &apos; or `` worlds &apos; &apos; .
the characters are coded letters , the experience , the history of the regions of the language .
whenever we can wake to life when we leave their sentences flow to the brain .
it is , in fact , in its way , something forbidden to swap shifts the god - waking up more and more of the stories , little universes and temporary planet .
it is a fact , whose dna is stored in lines , according to the old démonologických books make witchcraft .
after the books you - as it often is - is a chain of copyright reading .
i remember once you like to read .
you throw yourself into it again with pleasure , or that you feel after years of otherwise ?
now i &apos; d rather just tell .
and what i found out ?
everywhere they live good intelligent people .
their essential character - they are discreet , too , to make a friendly emitted , do you feel with them alone .
i will give you an example - in the small town of red kostel lived was ( and i hope he &apos; s still alive , curly - haired one ) bookseller ( his name is conveniently cervenka ) , a friend and a good girl &apos; s bull .
when one group gropes anyway introduced me to individual articles chain posted my book the scrum .
i looked them in the eye , and then i was shown ragged , well - used copy of my book .
i am embarrassed put just reading sausages and briefly male wept .
we all stood there , weaving and drunkenly with tears of emotion .
then the young blond half - breed and jumped over the head with a roar from the window into the snow .
it was on the ground floor .
we ran into the night and what a happy rabies citlivců , pain and longing krajánků patriots - howled and bobbed as werewolves until morning .
each of your book is formally and content other than the others .
it is also on the text of the wind , dark presence ?
it is a narrative .
it is a tale of one country for nine nine rivers and mountains .
ivan bunin , in its revised suchodol , czech republic inserted into the mouth of the people &apos; s healer words from an old russian myth : at sea , in the ocean , on the island of bujanu .
psice lies on her gray boxes .
the horror , the horror of secrets .
it never happened , but they know you .
perhaps we once were devils in hell and lots of - what role in this country we will play .
are you going to write , or leave it again on the free flow of inspiration ?
the answers are forever - otokar brezina .
writing is a wonderful way of dialogue .
something huge and nameless , similar to the movement of the continent on the planet , it affects our sensibility of such depth and breadth of such that is quite beyond our horizon - and as a matter of course we do in terms of your programmed award .
we are paid by the influx of dopamine , a mixture of endorphins and other substances .
we are biological machines .
we want to mate , we are dying in defence and the acquisition of new personal territories .
sometimes the failure of compassion and glow .
only then do we have the right to call the people .
this is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders , sits on the pacific coast of ignorant and into the holes in their sails made from the dirty handkerchief grips the tides of warm wind .
i have to write , to be a man .
schools should focus more on math , spelling and grammar
in the hours of english literature to be read at least one of shakespeare &apos; s play , the novel of the 19 th century romantic poetry and contemporary british fiction since 1914 .
the test will also include a `` hidden text &apos; &apos; , to encourage a deeper reading ;
the combined courses of english literature and language will be cancelled .
from 2015 will require from students to have graduated from the language , and will be encouraged to choose the english literature as optional subject .
the department of education should tomorrow to issue the new curriculum for english and math - the first objects that have to go through radical change .
other significant items , changes are waiting for the next year .
in a separate move the ofqual , which oversees the graduation , reveals changes in the structure of graduation , and this , together with a new system of grading and smaller volume of projects for students .
in his speech in the summer of education minister michael gove said that `` there is a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our system of rehearsal , to regain the trust of the company &apos; &apos; , and that there is a need to insist that the senior test was `` more demanding , more ambitious and more stringent &apos; &apos; .
the study shows that the english schools spend less time mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries .
for comparison schools in australia spend an average of mathematics 143 hours a year and in singapore about 138 .
although there is no formal requirement to spend more time on math , coalition sources indicated that a final exams in math - together with greater emphasis on this subject in the rankings - the results are likely to encourage schools to provide extra lessons .
the curriculum will focus more on `` the problems of the real world , &apos; &apos; including financial mathematics .
mayor of cancer in ostrava kajnar democrats i am :
before the elections , the full unveiled long - simmering dispute between the two wings of the fighting for influence in ostrava .
it culminated in the mayor of ostrava petr kajnar turned to court because of the democratic candidates .
players case it nevertheless they did not speak to the party before the election even more damage .
they are now but electoral votes numbered .
the leadership of the ostrava democrats in monday night called the mayor of ostrava , stepped out of the party , and is likely to push for it to come to his office .
peter kajnar but wants to fight on .
what in disputes is and who is on whose side , described in an exclusive interview in the journal .
how do you see the outcome of the election ?
democrats certainly count with a much better result .
damage to her with us that before the election to address in the media disputes within the party ?
i imagine that social democracy might have a better outcome .
but on the other side of the state , in what is now the democrats .
this is a party that has its own internal problems , is internally and sick people perceive it , that &apos; s all right .
in the election that made it clear .
what are the internal illness democrats ?
the decline for some time to me through the ods and things like that , unfortunately , is now taking place in the social democracy .
so it is that lobbyists , influential people who previously expected their spoils find ods , moved to the people in the cssd and have influence over them .
it has to do with the fact that after the offices of the ostrava oslo police goes and collects computers .
it shows that democrats is composed of people who would like to the good of all the other , but many of them think primarily for the good of his own .
democrats are divided into two opposing camps in prague , as can be seen in the current struggle for power between haškovci and sobotkovci .
but even that is already preparing for a long time .
what occurred before the election in ostrava , was just a taste of what is happening now in prague .
hašek &apos; s wing was gradually filled positions , then after the election could cause a situation that will weaken sobotkovo wing .
a man is in politics , in a situation where sometimes must compromise .
but everyone has some internal border , when you do not have to compromise , and that is my case .
initially , i did not want to run for the house , but when i saw the whole thing inside the party , so i agreed with luboš zaorálek , to try to get to the regional candidate as mayor of ostrava strengthened just sobotkovo wing .
hašek &apos; s wing but it could stop .
why are on the side of bohuslav sobotka , and no michael jaroslav hašek ?
slávek sobotka , to me , is a man who always talk about the democrats , and to some extent of visions for the party and for the country .
i confess that , from the other side , i have heard of anything like that .
michael hašek just fighting for power .
i do not see how the bureau , which is lower than the authority of the central executive committee , to start just invoke president parties .
it is a struggle for power regardless of all the articles of association and against the party .
according to me what now michael hašek demonstrated in prague , ended his political career .
how did you feel that you are eyeing the leadership of the social democratic candidate to endorse .
political parties are based on competition , who are both from their members placed .
the competition should be largely based on programming visions and capacity of the people you meet the vision .
of course , in this competition reports and people who do not have much ability or vision , but political party is for them to lift the money elsewhere .
the problem is , when these people begin to get to the forefront by unscrupulous violate rules violate the statutes of the party .
their practices are in the political parties and the mafia to me that violate the laws of the czech republic .
to draw attention to the problem is more important to me than to consider if it has any kajnar a political future .
it is important that the parties began to respect the constitution .
therefore , you are handed a proposal before the elections to the court on the interim measures against any form of the democrats in the moravian - silesian region ?
the current district executive committee democrats in ostrava consolidates his power by the organisation , which he does not , he can cancel of establishing the new organization , gradually thrashes uncomfortable party members .
an example is even wanted to exclude richard bednařík from members of the club , but he appealed the and they then resolution on his exclusion rather canceled .
it shows that demand respect for the party through the courts is the last option , but at a time when the other ways and control authorities within the democrats have ceased to work , it is the only option .
management tool eyeing the democrats in the lead with mr adam rykalou is to call you out of the position of the mayor .
it is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post poruby lumír palyza .
as it is , and adam rykala lumír palyza tries to do everything to make me could appeal .
people are promising positions , acquire voices and for those voices then cemented his power in the party .
when i get back into the past , so everything that happened to be around the football club miner ostrava and purchase stadium bazala , was just a pretext to me could attack .
it was artificially staged , that i might be described as a man who gives money where it does not belong .
the city bought the property , which has for him a great strategic value .
so how do you see on your remaining as mayor of ?
the district committee was me and more people on monday urged to consider his staying in .
but i think it &apos; s like when a thief screams : thief !
if you look at the results of my work for the last eleven years , so i do not see anyone in ostrava social democracy , who initiated the push , and sometimes even against members of the party , the emergence of so many developing things , like industrial zones or expansion of science and technology park .
despite everything , i become a nuisance .
i do not read it differently than the way others to get through to the place , after which he covets .
you will still have to fight against these efforts ?
because if this republic of good work , you must work well , and political parties .
i can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state , if he can not even drive itself .
now , i think , therefore , that left the democrats , because i think that whoever causes cancer this side , i am not , but these people who are trying to drive me .
we want to show that pilsen still can win , promises rajtoral
it is a bit of a paradox .
while his team is primarily through profit or loss in the last time can not come , defender or reliever pilsen františek rajtoral victoria has form , which earned him a year after returning to the team .
he is also , full of fire activity , after surgery on him was in the game in teplice ordered the penalty kick .
the balloon was in the last two rounds against slavia and in france after the victory , but at the end of the two duel took a point .
frantisek rajtoral believes that his team in the game with a series of unpleasant jablonec breaks .
we want to show that we can win .
`` i believe that jablonec home defeat , &apos; &apos; says františek rajtoral .
the team is on a difficult struggle with severočechy who play offensive football , carefully prepared .
everything points to a game with jablonec , coach us well prepared , as always , we draw a lot of games videorozboru rivals .
`` i believe that friday night will be a great game , &apos; &apos; the czech player on the platform attracts fans doosan arena .
pilsen last matches went awry , as they wish , but the word crisis defender victoria refuses .
so it goes in football , sometimes you are in good form and sometimes worse .
but the crisis would in any case .
`` i believe that we will win on friday and again it will be good , &apos; &apos; says defender západočechů .
the victoria will again rely on the support of the fans .
`` it is played on a friday night and i wanted our fans , who are great , invite . &apos; &apos;
`` i believe that we win , &apos; &apos; adds rajtoral .
defend academic freedom , it applies to squire and ods .
i have repeatedly in recent months , called on the open letter , students , teachers and the leadership of the middle and high schools in several counties to defend academic freedom before the election campaign , which carried out the president milos zeman at schools .
i met with more or less success .
the president of the masaryk university in brno , who refused to lecture honorary president spoz zemanovci - in the pre - election period , it even got revenge in the form of the invitation to celebrate the national holiday , the czech republic .
here is a list of schools , who already were brave and visit milos zeman allow : technical university in brno , the grammar school hladnov in ostrava , high school of business in ostrava , college of business in cologne , j. e. purkyne university in usti nad labem .
now in pardubice meet with continuing pursuit of policies to universities .
the newly elected mep for the ods , dean of the school of electrical engineering and computer science , university of pardubice , simeon karamazov , refuses to resign from his academic function , and it seems normal .
professor , this really is not the same as if you had stayed in , for example , the mayor of a small city .
do you want to add to the generals democrats who exercised at the same time as members and the governor and as they degrade the profession ?
the people say that can handle both of these functions .
i know we have the example of michael jaroslav hašek , which handles even a few dozen functions .
but it probably is not just an example of the person that you should follow .
i find the opposite and a positive example of m. d. stepanka fraňková , which she had left the post , that could be devoted to the leadership of the city of pardubice .
the main reason for my recommendation to leave as dean , however , is that the combination of features you break apolitičnost academic soil pardubice university .
leadership pardubice ods sees your current action on both positions as a benefit for the university .
`` their &apos; &apos; school , however , you will be able to help , even without that , you will stay the dean .
i think that , as i have a similar view and rector of miroslav ludwig , have your students .
consider that even his resignation and keep his face .
otherwise , you may be that the voters in the next election count .
and it does not have to be long .
john kerry said : spying had gone too far .
the united states have gone in spying sometimes `` too far , &apos; &apos; he said , according to the afp agency chief of american diplomacy , john kerry during the videoconference between washington and london .
the collection of information but the minister served to prevent terrorist attacks .
`` the first admission from washington &apos; &apos; , according to the afp came in the middle of a controversy on both sides of the atlantic because of scandalous revelations about the massive data monitoring america &apos; s national security agency ( nsa ) , which became the target of american allies .
`` in some cases , i admit , as did the president ( barack obama ) , some of these actions have gone too far and that it will not happen in the future , &apos; &apos; said kerry .
in an interview , but he defended the practice .
the collection of information to be necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations , as were the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , in the us , the bombings in madrid in march 2004 or in london in july 2005 .
`` we have prevented the aircraft fell , the building exploded , and people were slaughtered , because we were able to be informed in time of plot , &apos; &apos; said kerry .
however , once again , admitted that the collection of information `` in some cases went disproportionately far &apos; &apos; .
the drama around the us intelligence , which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of telephone calls in europe began this month .
among other things , it appeared that the americans were also watching the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel .
european leaders were openly indignation and some of them have called on the european union to try to reach an agreement with the united states that would monitor the forbidden or significantly reduced .
a royal commission learned that before the actions against jonathan lord were indicted two employees of the christian association of young men ( ymca )
the royal commission for the sexual abuse of children to learn that , before the charges against child tutors jonathan lord of the city caringbah in 2011 , two employees of the christian association of young men ( ymca ) in new south wales were the indictment of the sexual abuse of children .
but before the commission said that , in his opening statement for the commission this association stated that , in their organisation never tackled case of sexual abuse of a child .
executive director phillip hare was asked about the case , which was one of the staff associations ymca accused of offences relating to child pornography , and on the other , the physical in caringbah associations of the ymca in 1991 , he was convicted of a sexual harassment of children in their care .
mr hare said gaili furnessové , adviser to the commission that he knew about the case , but not the second .
he admitted that the initial statements ymca associations were also inaccurate , as stated in the organisation of the ymca to carry out external audits , priced by the organisation as a leading advocate of the rights of children .
the evidence presented by the commission says that the organisation ymca was informed that the audit of the department of education and the company of august this year received the second lowest of four possible evaluation .
mr hare , which began with the association of ymca work when he was 21 , he admitted that the leadership from him down failed when mr lord adopted without assurances , whether he is aware of the staff of the obligation to notify security breaches of children .
earlier this year lord was convicted of a sexual advances 12 boys committed during the two years when he worked at the ymca associations .
he was jailed for at least six years .

faa : air passengers can now in aircraft use technological gains ( but not call from their mobile phones )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices , `` from gate to gate &apos; &apos;- in addition to the call from their mobile phones - to reading , playing games , watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated new rules on thursday issued a federal aviation administration ( faa ) .
passengers but do not expect changes occur immediately .
how quickly will change introduced will vary according to the individual airlines , said the faa administrator michael huerta , at the press conference .
airlines will have to manage the faa demonstrate the extent to which their aircraft correspond to the new rules , and that the updated training manual for cabin crew and storage facilities , to comply with the new rules .
the faa said that since some airlines received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .
between companies , which already plans are transmitted , delta and jetblue .
`` depending on the existence of such a plan , we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly , &apos; &apos; the faa said in its statement .
currently , from passengers required to switch off their smart phones , tablets and other devices , as soon as the door closed aircraft .
they can not be turned on until it reaches the height of 3 miles and captain of the issue .
from passengers are expected to their plants to shut down again when the plane down to land , and on them until the plane was on the ground .
under the new rules , airlines , whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference , to allow its customers to use their devices during take - off , landing and taxiing , the faa said .
from most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft , which had been arranged so that passengers can use the wifi at higher altitudes , is expected to meet these criteria .
laura gladingová , president of the association of professional stewards , welcomed the changes .
`` as soon as the new rules introduced safely - and we will be working closely with airlines - , it will be a success , &apos; &apos; she said in her statement gladingová .
we frankly tired of that look like `` guards &apos; &apos; .
but the surfing the internet , e - mail and sms or downloading data to remain below 3 miles altitude of the disabled , the agency said .
passengers will be notified that their smart phones , tablets and other devices switched into the air .
and still no words with friends , online game of scrabble , played by actor alec baldwin on his smart phone in 2011 , when he was , as is well known , fired from aircraft american airlines , because he refused to shut down their equipment when the plane was parked at the gate .
and heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that someone could get hurt if flying around the cabin .
calls from mobile phones will be on board remains banned .
the rules for the use of mobile phones to designate the faa , but the us federal committee for telecommunications .
the faa may in some electronic equipment during take - off and landing lift the ban .
last month , mark rosenker from the national committee for safety in transport , an expert on national security in transport at cbs news , he said that mobile phones are still considered a risk .
`` mobile phones are really the problem , not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation equipment , but data from the fcc also know that in the air can cause interference of broadcasting tower , &apos; &apos; said rosenker .
the trade advisory committee created by the administration of the faa , therefore , to examine the problem , last month suggested that the government allowed the wider use of electronic devices .
the faa in recent years has been pressured to ease restrictions on their use .
critics like senator claire mccaskillová , democrat of missouri , argues that there is no valid safety reason for the ban .
restrictions are also becoming difficult to enforce , because of the use of such devices is ubiquitous .
some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers and forgets to turn off their devices or ignored .
the faa began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment , when passengers began to carry the fm radio , technical achievement of that time .
new airlines are much more reliant on the electrical systems of the aircraft than previous generations , but they are also designed and approved by the faa management that they are immune to electronic jamming .
airlines have for several years , offered to passengers use wi - fi in travel altitudes .
plans for the wi - fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
most of the big airlines under the new rules should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices , said huertová .
the current electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio broadcast , than it was to the facilities of previous generations .
for example , the electronic reader issued in turning the page only minimum broadcasting .
but television is stronger when devices downloading or uploading data .
among those who are pushing for it to be free of restrictions on the use of such devices by passengers , is amazon . com .
in 2011 by representatives of the company &apos; s transport plane loaded with its electronic reader kindle and carried out the test flight , but no problem emerged .
the members of the advisory committee of the faa expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose a risk .
douglas kidd from the national association of airline passengers said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots , designed to promote the fact that such devices may cause interference air systems , and most of these reports is very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa pilots allowed ordered the passengers off the device during the instrument flying in low visibility .
the travel industry welcomed the changes and the terms under a sensible approach for the travelling public , which technology used in profusion .
`` we are pleased that the faa acknowledged that pleasant travel experience is not in breach of security , &apos; &apos; said roger dow , the executive director of the u. s. travel association .
in an unprecedented admission john kerry said that american espionage `` gone too far &apos; &apos;

mr. kerry , however , insisted that the nsa seeks good and that its surveillance operation had saved many lives .
he added : `` we have been dealing with the new world , in which people are willing to blow themselves . &apos; &apos;

more revelations cited documents `` snowden , that the nsa watched the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel and other world leaders to 34 .

`` while we are adjusting their monitoring programmes , in order to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also recognize the fact that we are not the only ones who conducts espionage , &apos; &apos; murphy said .

lived in them to 80,000 people , and especially the roma .
the adults in ghettos were without a job , the families were dependent on benefits , the children seen in `` special &apos; &apos; schools .
about usury .
according to experts , meanwhile , about a hundred more problematic sites .
relations between their people and the other is to increase .
in a few places , held anti - roma marches .

this mechanism is successfully for several years already injected in slovakia , where the problem is the socially excluded locations far higher than in the czech republic .
`` there are the so - called roma settlements , &apos; &apos; said the authors of the report .
how many specialists should be in the czech republic , is not yet clear .
the answer is to give the analysis to determine where it was specific to the policeman .
it will also depend on how much money to these members will be able to police after the end of the project made available each year .
under the proposal for the project first selected officers receive training in slovakia .
the following year training should go through five decades of members .
result from them the most suitable candidates .
it should also be special training for police officers , who will be in ghettos .
according to the authors would help to improve the situation of mainly social housing .

`` at first it was a shock , but the view from the fourth floor of a large park and the dam of me on the other side of the inspirational , &apos; &apos; says ivan on first impression .
at first i thought that it would be a stopgap for three years .
`` today we lived here for more than 13 years , and not only because of the reconstruction would change , &apos; &apos; says the owner .
mother and daughter had migrated from stodvacetimetrového apartment into a smaller area with 62 m 2 and almost all the equipment out .
the action was not simple , things were stored for friends and gradual arranging it took almost a year .
the new apartment was in pretty good shape , but to pass the necessary adjustments , such as painting the exchange of doors or windows .
the previous owner of the core , but the owner crashed the most uncomfortable and impractical to unnecessarily large hall , and a small bathroom .
combining two rooms a multifunctional living space .
architects used to define each zone and the breakdown of the drywall , which enabled the new position of lights .
the first shot , after a few years , was the removal of the rungs in the living room .
the apartment had changed available for free , but the room has acquired the airiness and opened with a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery .
the next step in improving standards was compensation for laminate floors of pvc .
with a bathroom , ivan did not know of the council .
years ago i drew the magazines on housing and looking for inspiration .
in one of them , i recently discovered an interesting implementation .
the recommendations so i spoke to young decorator kamila douděrovou .
`` in fact , it was the most important step , &apos; &apos; says ivan .
thanks to the rebuilding of the bathroom was done at the same time , to make available the hall .
architect of the linked space toilet and bathroom and two doors with otvíravými wings replaced one sliding , thus sparing the place .
the bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently accessible .
high - quality imitate sandstone tiling , in the shower is more comfortable seat in the toilet bidetová shower .
a successful cooperation with camilla douděrovou continued .
in the order of how to build a dream was fast , but the fundamental change in the living room , which was also the architect martin Čeněk .
in space , which was created two smaller rooms , we had to get three functions , dining , living and sleeping , without the help of classic principles of optical division , for example , or japanese polopříčkami walls .
`` that would result in a breach of openness and uniformity of space , &apos; &apos; explains an architect .
originally managed to separate sleeping and living part .
enough to turn his back two sofas and between them to build a custom cabinet linens .
dining nook define the shades of the floor and paint .
on the floor in the kitchen and dining area used the architect of the high - quality marmoleum , sliding door animated wallpaper with model .
kitchen where necessary to obscure sliding panels wallpaper .
the new floor of properties marmolea has compared to previous fiberglass from a number of advantages : the softer slippery surface seamless and better sound insulation .
the system of niches and ceilings of sheetrock highlighted color is an example of how you can work in the suburbs with space .
colors i left on architects , i wanted it to be joyful .
`` i like the same shade of orange , i had in the previous quarters , &apos; &apos; says ivan .
a poultice of grafoskla themed blooming magnolia is practical and creates significant aesthetic element .
the vigorous warm tone architects chosen white , which highlighted the modern functional style .
in a small apartment managed to save the books , among other things , into space under the window sills .
everything is within reach , lamps are comfortably controlled remotely .
in contrast the new interior converted it works well with older , for example , with dozens of years old crystal chandelier , with high - quality artwork ivana collects all his life .
the last came on a number of the kitchen .
the cabinets were previously deployed on both sides and the owner had seemed a bit like in the tunnel .
an architect on their number and rearranged the deployment .
the furniture in a simple design is made to order , the white surface softened slightly pearly surface .
in a small space to accommodate thanks to inventive solution to the washing machine , dryer , dishwasher .
the appearance of a small kitchen revived the all - glass lining the walls above the desk .
unique grafosklo digitally printed with the motive is attractive , moreover , are well maintained .
ivana chose magnolia blossoms , which reminded her favorite neighborhood , where she lived for years .
now , it seems , is happy here .
the bathroom was small tub and a sink , the new owner has chosen a neutral shade of the mural .
a large shower stall a glass door ronal .
the task was to create from the environment , a clear simple space in which functions and the device will be in harmony .
the interior of the bodies of color and we are united and try for his elegant , cozy , not too crowded appearance .
`` another condition was a barrier - free solution with the fewest obstacles and opportunities of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of things , &apos; &apos; says kamila douděrová .

jana péťová : step back .
so i decided to take a step back , but when i think of it , it is not actually a step , but a big jump , jump on a few years back , and that in the memories in my childhood .
it is the memory of what it was to have no trouble and only come from school and wash the dishes , vacuum and do your homework .
although these `` obligations &apos; &apos; , it was mostly just a theory , the wishes of parents .
the practice was completely different - run from school , drop the bag into a corner and run out .
play with the other children ball games , hopscotch .
then in the series , helen and her boys to embroider chain stitch a tablecloth for grandmother for her birthday .
and then after the subsequent warnings that finally wash dishes , vacuum , in the winter of fetching wood in the earthenware stoves and tasks to do after dusk under a lamp ( or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write love poetry to school love ) .
morning breakfast domestic strawberry jam ( from a real fruit , no such jams what you are selling now , whose contents beside strawberries or lying ) and drink the tea of dried herbs , which we are so pleased with my mom .
i remember those magical nights when there was dead silence in the room when the sister of recording songs on the radio on the tapes , which were centered in the old marquee after mom .
and then we pencil on the tapes - and kept the same song , one of our favorite and to drink the trap .
we talked on the phone or over the table for using cans , which were tied to string - and while we are on the phone to hear better , it was to be thoroughly cleaned his ears , then uchošťour + wadding was a match .
the minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now , and my parents from it could live so that nothing was amiss .
we did not need any of those iphones , ipady even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes .
the clothes are handed down from generation to generation , and the best `` work of art &apos; &apos; into the closet was tie - dyed t - shirt of domestic production for using the sava .
from electronics to us , to the satisfaction of the mother &apos; s tape recorder , and so the walkman , which we shared with his sister , which by the way we use only in the train on a school trip .
we thought it was interesting to play with his aunt pov hop or candyland or , as i have said , `` just go out . &apos; &apos;
when i was a little older than we got under the christmas tree vcr , sure to parents saving for a long time , but unfortunately for us for a long time .
my younger sister to narwhal strudel , supposedly so beautifully eat those tapes , so she tried , if i eat pie .
unfortunately , eat , but it was his last bite .
well , and this incident is still , poor thing , on a plate from dad still .
he says that when she was little , lenka narwhal pie in the video and thought that it plays a recipe and played , because it still does not know how to cook .
i remember , we were all able to communicate , communicate without a cell phone , computer .
together with her sister was on vacation with his grandmother who agreed with the neighbor &apos; s granddaughter , when we meet again in the summer of next year for grandmothers - and that was it , that was true .
we met .
promise to have someone that you will see in a year ? !
i also remember for the winter , when we were running out , with the whole village built snowmen , went on the snowy hill at the church on sacks stuffed with straw .
then we had dinner together with the family , and we talked about the previous day .
we are , of course , the nurse told before each dinner the notorious phrase : `` go wash your hands ! &apos; &apos;
yes , it is true today , but definitely not in the bathroom to tap přivázáné soap netted from lemons .
after dinner , when my dad in the garage `` worked &apos; &apos; in beer with jarda from the village , lay down to my mother on the floor , his feet propped on the tiled stove , opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackle of wood from the stove .
we were closer - really - we did not count how many we have friends on the social network , we knew how many friends , the real !
they communicated , we - we - we wrote daily messages across various hut , sms .
nothing of the sort , and yet we knew far more .
and so i could go on for a long time .
it &apos; s nice to remember , especially if these memories will add that , for the tour of the album , which are neatly plastered black horns from black - and - white photos .
and if i did not know how old i was then , from behind the photos is always written in the year of the picture .
i watch that , although we did not really suit haircuts in pots , and we should pants after your cousin of two larger numbers , no one is laughing at us before , so it was not a normal ( in ) .
and i would rather back on the step forward - to reality .
by 2013 , and wait for the modern period up to be one for my children .
what i do know is that these my memories are now for the young generation of adolescents so at least somewhere `` age of yesteryear , &apos; &apos; and i think a lot coming , that this `` předopičí &apos; &apos; period .
i would not have wanted it !

palmer &apos; s united party can control in the senate to four voices , which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities .
but mr palmer said that in a conflict of interest may be only ministers and added that abbott &apos; s daughters were in a position where they could be from the policy of personal benefit .

the new civil code is preparing six out of ten firms&apos;
the effectiveness of the new civil code and the law on commercial corporations from 1 january 2014 is intensively preparing six out of ten firms .
only eight percent of respondents representatives of companies argued that the issues associated with the two key codes in their company at all .
it is clear from the survey firm ambruz &amp; amp ; dark deloitte legal , which examined the views of 108 czech companies .
in connection with the deadline approaches , the effectiveness of the two key codes now at the last minute , many managers beginning to realize what can have a significant impact on the business of their companies .
the biggest change in private law in the last 50 years , in our view , the touch of all citizens and businesses in the czech republic .
because of the manoeuvre politicians lived long business sector in the revolutionary changes happen eventually , or not .
`` now , however , they have only a few weeks to transition to the new law passed for their firms without complications , &apos; &apos; commented on the results of the partner ambruz &amp; amp ; dark deloitte legal spáčil jan .
from 61 percent of companies heavily engaged in new code 26 percent said that their firms already take all necessary measures to be ready in time .
furthermore , 35 percent of the companies in this number is going to take the necessary measures in time .
against that every fifth firm rekodifikacemi not yet addressed , yet it has a clear idea of how to prepare .
a total of 11 percent does not view and can not assess .
only eight percent of companies , admits that the rekodifikacemi has not yet been addressed .
the most important legal issue related to the new civil code is for the largest number of firms questioned new contracts ( 21 percent ) , followed by the solutions business conditions ( 16 percent ) and the changes in the real estate and liability ( 10 percent ) .
the contracts will be one of the most important news for rekodifikace , consolidating adjustments contracts only in the context of the new civil code .
the current adjustment in the parallel civil and commercial code is extinguished , resulting in the right for citizens and businesses should become clearer .
`` in the case of entrepreneurs the new legislation will offer many news with an emphasis on greater freedom of relationships , &apos; &apos; said lawyer ambruz &amp; amp ; dark deloitte legal lukáš subject .
in connection with the commercial corporations deemed most important topic of almost a quarter of companies issue of increasing responsibility statutory bodies .
the following topics related to changes in convening and the general meeting ( 15 percent ) and the representation of the company ( 14 percent ) .
the new legislation means tightening obligations and the possible implications for statutory bodies , especially in a situation when the company is at risk of bankruptcy or get into it .
`` in practice , this means that if members of the board of directors and agents firms not to negotiate with proper management and avert imminent bankruptcy , the company may lose the benefit for their duties for the last two years , &apos; &apos; said spáčil .
the revelation of the nsa increases social paranoia monitoring by the state
a peaceful day by the end of august , the german police helicopter buzzed over an american consular office in frankfurt , the main town of the german economy .
according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the german domestic intelligence agency , the purpose of the mission was a photograph of the roof of the american outposts , which is situated less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
the german media claims that the bfv hoping she will be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas , and this action began in berlin exchange of views between the american and german foreign minister .
james clapper , the us director of national intelligence , in september again insisted that the united states used its foreign intelligence capabilities , `` to stealing commercial secrets of foreign companies in favour of us companies and strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit . &apos; &apos;
but since edward snowden , who became an informant collaborator , began to reveal their valuable collection of spying on the united states , european governments and business leaders i do not know if they have the words of the trust .
after the news that the us national security agency reconnaissance in the brazilian oil company , gained access to the data , with whom they have american cloudoví providers , including google and yahoo , reached the general paranoia about the monitoring of the new dimensions .
the last straw came with the revelation that the phone of chancellor angela merkel was maybe ten years bugged .
if it can be the most powerful person in europe , then they are certainly potential targets and business leaders .
snowden made transparent intensive cooperation between the u. s. intelligence agencies and companies .
i would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit .
`` germany needs to wake up , &apos; &apos; said oliver grüne bitmi , the president of the company , which represents small and medium - sized companies it in germany .
according to the survey , issued in july advisory service ey german companies are convinced that , in terms of industrial espionage and theft of data , the us now represents as great a risk as china .
throughout the dossier exposed mr snowden , but so far there is no evidence that the united states transmit the commercial secrets of foreign companies in their own companies .
politicians have expressed concerns that the eu lacks a certain abilities in the area of it and the internet , and said that it should be trying to reduce its dependence on the us :
business leaders are skeptical about that .
of the german parliament , the voices that we should make the german google .
i just i can close my eyes and is slowly open ...
that is not the way , says tiasso plattner , the president of the german software company sap .
if someone wanted a strong european it industry , had it 20 years ago , and left to die .
everything in germany subsidises , from coal to cars and farmers .
everything except the it industry .
the scope and the technical maturity of american spy agencies found snowden is for some companies who have considered that the biggest threat of monitoring is china , still shocking .
there is a large turnover in cloudové computing , where european leaders on a wider scale , realised that the data stored in the us fall under its jurisdiction , and are therefore potentially challenged .
according to a survey carried out by the business community cloud security alliance of approximately 10 percent of american members after the discovery of the us prism on data mining canceled plans to use cloudového provider based in the us .
snabe them , one of the heads of sap , says : `` we have a new question for customers who have not been here a year ago - where are my data is stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction will remain physically ? &apos; &apos;
many german senior officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected .
that implementing economic espionage , is not a surprise .
it has always happened .
`` it is a crucial issue for many years and has not changed significantly during the current debate , &apos; &apos; says kurt bock , director - general of the agrochemical companies basf .
the americans on us by spying on commercial and industrial level , as we are spying on them , because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate leaders are generally very much want to boast of counter - measures , which have made to the attacker may provide an advantage .
in the case of large companies have long recalls that take on fair free memory usb disk or have unprotected notebook in the hotel room is at least unwise .
ulrich hackenberg , a member of the board of the automakers - audi , says that for many years , it is common practice to gather before the meeting of the board of directors of the mobile phones , that they can not be used as a listening device .
the german bfv managers advised to consider whether or not to use on foreign trips , simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk that the smart phones can be safeguarded .
prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out .
however , there is concern that small and medium - sized businesses will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market .
`` small and medium - sized enterprises often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access , &apos; &apos; warns in its report the bfv .
the us company warns of economic espionage from other countries .
according to the washington post &apos; s american documents national intelligence estimate in february france next to russia and israel in the second row of offenders who are involved in hacking activities for economic correspondent , and it now in china .
a member of the council in german risk - free society concluded that , in terms of economic espionage , `` the french are the worst . &apos; &apos;
bernard squarcini , the former head of the dcri , the french domestic intelligence agency this month in one of the talks , said : `` the services fully aware that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , carry out spying on its allies . &apos; &apos;
the new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking &apos;
scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine , which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes .
a single dose of vaccine could for life to protect the mouse in front of addiction to nicotine .
before the trials on people &apos; s need to carry out further tests , which will take several years , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college in new york , says that the first signs are good .
`` we certainly hope that this type of vaccine strategy may finally help millions of smokers who try to stop and have exhausted all methods available today in the market , but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches to overcome , &apos; &apos; said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which was designed to carry the genetic information to create antinikotinových antibodies .
the virus infects the liver cells selectively , then start to create a continuous stream of these antibodies .
the antibodies are all nicotine molecules in the blood stream and neutralise them before they get into the brain , thereby preventing the smoker got nicotine hit .
in vaccinated mice , which was subsequently delivered nicotine , continued their normal activities .
but the mice , which have not been vaccinated , `` calmed &apos; &apos; , said the researchers , which is a sign that nicotine to get into the brain .
experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies .
the injections had to be given so often , in order to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies , so have proved expensive and impractical .
the costs of the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert the liver cells at the plant for the production of antibodies .
professor crystal said that if the future of vaccine for people are completely safe , they could bring children before they will be tempted to try a cigarette , and this would avoid the nicotine addiction .
more likely it would use smokers to quit .
`` they will know that if they start smoking again , because of the nicotine vaccine of no benefit , and it will help them with this habit to break , &apos; &apos; he said .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but cautioned that more research is needed .
a desperate cry of obama &apos; s voters
obama was elected twice - i hope for a possible change
he says that obama &apos; s sincere efforts to derail the obstruction of the republican party
obstructive policy can not excuse the woes of web pages of obama &apos; s health care or drone aircraft attacks
memoirs of the obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could happen
nathaniel p. morris of the second year of a medical student at harvard .
these days i read very sad book .
on this book , i thought of me during the dark days of my second year at medical school will encourage and restore in me a glimmer of hope .
it &apos; s called `` the audacity to win &apos; &apos; ( the audacity to victory ) , and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when the evening finish reports of patients , and i am going to bed , the book me back to a time when policy has inspired millions of people and the speeches you breathless .
the elections were overwhelming and television news force us to think about the historical value of this moment .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents were hiding , the newspaper found .
the white house team headed young visionaries and the nation was ready for a change .
during the inauguration in 2008 , obama should support 82 percent .
and here i am closing the book .
go to today &apos; s rough awakening , like waking up from a dream .
it &apos; s hard to remember these optimistic days - seem to be distant memories , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years after i threw his first election ballot , really has to change .
it was not what i had imagined .
i acknowledge that obama has achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law on the care available over the withdrawal of our troops from iraq and an end to the policy of `` not to ask questions , to say nothing &apos; &apos; after the killing of osama bin laden .
in addition , i am convinced that the partisan obstruction reverse many efforts to move our nation forward : among the other &apos; s immigration reform , the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in guantánámu .
but after many situations where i am in front of colleagues and friends said the obama administration , i am on the explanation , which can provide , came to the absolute limit .
i was in a place of political desperation .
obstruction of the republicans can not explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders , even with the raids drones , which are killing innocent children overseas .
they can not explain it , that the national security agency collects data about the private lives of americans , or even that haunts the misconduct of government reveals .
they can not be held responsible for the execution of anwar al - awlakího , an american citizen , without proper court for reducing public contributions and spending during the presidential campaign .
they can not justify the findings of the report , which says that the white house &apos; s efforts to muzzle the media are `` aggressive ... from the nixon administration . &apos; &apos;
and most recently , can not excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on the care available simple web pages .
i do not know whether something like this could be expected .
whether i had in the 18 years that the government may be in breach of political campaigns that preceded it .
an elected office apparently does not have a predictable pattern and our public conversations will shape the opposition political party and the random events like a massacre in newton .
but all of the examples i mentioned above , is largely the result of his own seem to be the administration &apos; s decision .
and that &apos; s what worries me the most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was thrilled with his candidacy .
mitt romney was confused and honed alternative and seemed unable to consolidate its policy or position .
i had the feeling that a second term for obama , free from the pressure of the next election , filled with hope , which we had heard .
still , it is a return to 2008 - with the aid of obama this week dropped below 45 % - through this book is increasingly difficult .
it forces me to remember that many of the promises that were lost .
this week i read a chapter in the book about how obama during the primaries in pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with clinton .
for additional meeting during the campaign , he told his staff to get back into the groove and remain faithful to their mission .
`` i want to get back to our magic , &apos; &apos; he said .
we must not forget who we are .
five years have passed , mr. president , i agree with you completely .

syria destroyed vital equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas , said thursday the global supervision of chemical weapons , while the violent conflicts in the north of the country , near one of the places where they are expected to toxic substances .
on thursday , a syrian activist group , said that since the beginning of the civil war in almost three years ago was killed more than 120 000 inhabitants .
the notice of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons came the day before , november 1 .
the term , which the organization , based in the hague , set for damascus destruction or blocking traffic all the equipment for the production of chemical weapons and equipment for mixing the chemicals in order to create a poisonous gas and the performance of the munitions .
the completion of this principle in the initial stages of the destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable , which aims to destroy until mid - 2014 all chemical weapons to damascus .
the destruction of equipment means that syria will be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and supplies .
it is expected that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and nerve sarin gas .
the announcement came at a moment when the fighting raged on thursday in the town of safira , which experts as the headquarters of the plant for the production of chemical weapons and stores , said the syrian vantage points for human rights , based in britain .
a group of activists who , through a network of activists in syria to monitor the total number of victims , on thursday announced that killed 120 296 people .
it has to be 61 067 6 365 civilians , including children .

among those killed was also 2 202 government defectors and approximately 5 375 opposition fighters , many of whom are foreigners .
on 25 july , the united nations estimated that since march 2011 , 100,000 people died in the conflict .
since then , the number has not been updated .
the conflict forced about 2 million people , to have left the country .
assad &apos; s troops had fought in safiře against the insurgents , many of whom are associated with al qaeda , for weeks .
post on thursday indicated that the losses were on both sides , but did not have a specific number .
the fighting underlined the danger facing the inspectors for chemical weapons , who are in their mission , when they are in the middle of the ongoing civil war in syria of chemical arsenal , must deal with tight deadlines .
in a statement from the office of the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , was told that his team is now a `` satisfied that verified - and watched the destruction of the syrian - declared major equipment for the manufacture and blending / performance &apos; &apos; .
he added that `` currently there are no further control activities . &apos; &apos;
earlier this week , the inspectors said it completed the first round of verification work when visited 21 out of 23 seats declared damascus .
the inspectors said that because of safety concerns were not able to visit two places .
on thursday , the opcw said that the two were in syria `` abandoned and ... the agenda of chemical weapons , which included , have been moved to two other seats declared , which has been checked . &apos; &apos;
was not immediately clear whether the device in safiře was one of those places that the opcw inspectors could visit .
syria agreed to the plan of total destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the executive committee of the office of the opcw next month .
`` i salute the courage and bravery , you have shown in fulfilling this mission , demanding that the organisation should be , &apos; &apos; said director of observers ahmet uzumcu in his notes issued by the office of the opcw .
now in its third year , is standing against him in the civil war of the mainly sunni muslim rebels and assad &apos; s government with its security forces , which are full of members of the alevi sect of shi &apos; ite islam , offshoots .
as for further development , the head of the observatory ramí abdul rahman said that on wednesday , there was a massive explosion inside the air defense installations in the syrian coastal province of lázikíja .
he said that the cause of the explosion was not known .
alexei miller , the gazprom says that the pipeline in bulgaria launches new gas era
launching the construction of the south stream gas pipeline in bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest european energy projects , said the director of gazprom .
`` today we are witnessing a milestone : began construction on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , &apos; &apos; the president said gazprom alexei miller in a statement .
this project is a key element of the energy security of the entire european continent .
the south stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of russian exports across europe .
the dispute between gazprom and its partners in ukraine , which brings the majority of russian gas to europe , adds to the risk of conventional routes , officials say .
miller says that direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are `` forever &apos; &apos; removed .
once the project begins in 2015 its operation , the bulgarian consumers will get gas from the south stream gas pipeline for subsidized price .
gazprom says that the building is in other countries in the direction of the flow to start at the end of this year .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
early puberty advanced earlier :
research has shown that - selected african - american women and hispánky reaching puberty earlier than their caucasian contours .
the physical changes mean that approaching puberty
there is no evidence for this are hormones or other chemicals
experts say that one of the triggers of the earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity .
the trend is not so evident earlier puberty for boys .
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children &apos; s health and family problems .
the mother of a shock , when her daughter to grow breasts and pubic hair at the groin in 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of paediatric doctors this week in orlando , florida , explained the paediatric endocrinologist dr paul kaplowitz , that these physical changes between american girls are fairly common , and represent a new standard .
`` a lot of the time i spent my parents said that it is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty , &apos; &apos; said kaplowitz
visible signs of development , as is the growth of chest hair at the groin and under his arm and body odor , the girls there earlier .
in the last 40 years , however , he was just a small shift in age at the time of the first period .
in the united states , is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to age 12,75 years in 1970 .
`` when you start to develop breasts , expire at least two to three years before the first period , &apos; &apos; said kaplowitz , who is also the author of the book `` early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem &apos; &apos; ( early puberty in girls : essential guide to manage this problem of frequent )
the most reliable test of how she will continue , it &apos; s time .
it is discussed what activates the real beginning puberty , but if it is accompanied by the growth of breast growth spurt before 8 years of age , she is considered `` prematurely mature . &apos; &apos;
in most cases , the process slows or stops - which may pediatricians closely monitored .
faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist carried out tests in order to avoid serious problems , such as a tumor or cyst .
there are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences : premature aging bones , which can ultimately lead to stop the growth and dwarfism in adulthood .
recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment depends on the age of the child , the speed of development , the speed of growth and emotional maturity .
also important are the psycho - sociological aspects .
when it comes to medication , is careful kaplowitz , but acknowledges that `` the suppression of puberty may reduce the problems with the behaviour of the girl and her emotions that are different from their peers . &apos; &apos;
understandable is another big problem : parents simply do not want their very young daughters periods .
`` they are worried that it may become pregnant , or how it would handle the hygiene , &apos; &apos; said kaplowitz .
`` it was a shock , &apos; &apos; says one woman , whose daughter began to have periods in 10 years .
although there were indications of menstruation and we spoke , she was not prepared emotionally .
she came home from school frightened and angry , she is of her friends first .
there are many well - known theories about the causes of premature puberty .
still , there is no consistent evidence that they are to blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
the boys - like girls are reaching puberty earlier .
kaplowitz promotes the presumption that the biggest reason is an epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 , he helped to carry out the study on girls aged 6 to 9 years , which combines the body fat to the timing of puberty .
other findings to this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country have - selected african - american women and hispánky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .
explanations are different .
from a global perspective , it seems that the patterns of early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions across the climate to genes .
another puzzle : although the boys at a young age appears hair in her face and groin , the trend towards full flowering early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls .
the other doctors participating in the conference of the american association of paediatricians ( aap ) added to this subject more complexity .
acne , or her pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers .
`` we have to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty , &apos; &apos; said lawrence silverman , paediatric endocrinologist from goryebské children &apos; s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to get from your child &apos; s doctor instructions on how to talk to their children .
`` it may mean the need to talk with the child sooner than you expected , &apos; &apos; said kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , your child will likely respond well .
the girls that are developing earlier , they need reassurance that , although it is early , this process is a normal part of life .
hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters into syria .
there is a decisive battle .
lebanon &apos; s hezbollah deployed 15,000 of his fighters north of damascus , in preparation for a decisive battle on the mountain area kalamún .
according to reports in israel still advanced wednesday raids on two sites in western syria destroyed the rocket intended hezbollah .
the lebanese shia organisation fighting in syria on the side of the army .
its programme is also the fight against israel , which is not involved in the syrian conflict , but clearly said that prevents the transfer of weapons to hezbollah in lebanon .
reports on wednesday of the israeli air raids on arms caches in western syria remains to be clarified .
israel did not comment on the attack , but he confirmed the us sources .
according to the syrian websites dampress . com hit by rockets fired from the mediterranean sea syrian missile base snúbar džabla south of latákíje .
the news station al - arabíja claims that have been hit by two warehouses in which missiles are ready to transfer to lebanon .
according to its resources on russian rockets sa - 8 .
israel refused to comment on the report , but the military analyst ron ben yishai said that syria is constantly trying to supply hezbollah rockets and the syrian air force teaches members of hezbollah &apos; s armed section with rockets .
sa - 8 are outdated rockets , which has the syrian army since the 1980 s .
they are placed on the chassis .
even though they are relatively primitive , thanks to mobility and small size is possible , it is easy to hide .
they are equipped with radar , but after firing missiles off , so it &apos; s hard to focus .
latákíja lies in western syria , in an area inhabited by reigning alávity .
the well - guarded area and hezbollah in the past was involved in the fighting in western syria .
claims that helps protect the syrian shiite community , which belongs to the alawite .
it is now reportedly 15,000 of his fighters ready to help conquer the army back kalamún .
together with hezbollah there strengthens its troops also syrian army .
kalamún lies between damascus and the third largest city homs country .
the battle is to be as sources of al - arabíji in retaliation for the recent attack on the headquarters of the opposition syrian shia brigade fadla abu abbas in shi &apos; ite parts of damascus .
hezbollah helped this year the syrian military win back the city kusajr in the lebanese border .
many of the insurgents from kusajru went into kalamúnu .
who says that maliki has a large share of the resurgence of sectarian violence in iraq , which is also partly the work of the fighting in neighbouring syria .
for democrats negotiates sobotka .
social democracy is crumbling , the pp and babišovci talking and common procedure .
if the social democrats into several weeks of tough , sit around a table with a perfect partners , who put on the table a list of requirements , including the ministerial posts .
the envoys democrats then either swallow sour grapes , nodded to the coalition or nothing short of a minority government .
bohuslav sobotka after four days , when he carried on a wave of sympathy for the first time .
yesterday he could not control the political body , and especially to force a convicted liar , to resign .
a negotiator for the party , he is the only other team members will leave to after a key meeting of the central executive committee ( dvv ) .
i apologized to the members of the panel , and now the citizens .
he does not have to lie in your personal life , not in public .
`` it was a mistake , &apos; &apos; he said after meeting the social democracy michal hašek .
he added that the post of first vice - president of allegiance .
`` his decision to give 10 november at dvv hašek , &apos; &apos; he said .
similarly , as vice - president of democrats zdenek Škromach and chief of the club jerome tejc .
but , he pointed out that he was elected just two days ago .
both members then declared that they will do all it can to 50 - strong club democrats was one voice .
the absurd theater put crown michal hašek sentence : `` i am a member of the social democratic fifteen years , i have always been loyal to its brand and i respected the decision of the party bodies . &apos; &apos;
so another lie in direct transmission .
or , perhaps , in a call for his resignation and sobotkově exclusion from the negotiating team , i forgot that august dvv with 57 percent held that the bohuslav sobotka is the candidate for prime minister ?
the democrats , however , summoning dvv until next sunday , the army made powerful enemies .
his opponents have ten days to flood the e - mails 192 members of this body , and the media a variety of gossip and rumor , possibly commemorated the real error sobotkovy political career .
will vigorously fight dirty laundry , there are signs the alliance between coal and zdenek bakala sobotkovým wing .
he will discuss the friendly relationship bohuslav sobotka and an influential advocate radek humble .
the crazy comes bubbling disputes in the south moravia or moravian - silesian organisation .
the words are the ostrava mayor and sobotkova ally peter kajnar : `` i signed charter 77 , therefore , that the country ruled with idiots . &apos; &apos;
if dvv met this weekend , liar , would probably be forced into a ritual sacrifice their functions .
traitors to sprinkle the head of ash and stay .
and now the boss of triumphing democrats then end up with the nickname bohuslav pyrrha .
the un is celebrating the new goals to fight poverty
the united nations immediately begin work on a new set of targets , which will replace the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which were introduced 12 years ago in order to deal with the global poverty .
before the un summit on sustainable development , which began overnight in rio de janeiro , australian diplomats played a key role in promoting `` sustainable development goals &apos; &apos; to replace the mdgs , which expire in 2015 .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be approved by world leaders , including ms gillardové , during the summit .
un secretary general ban ki - moon overnight at the summit said that now is the time to `` rise above national interests . &apos; &apos;
`` i am pleased that the member states agreed to start and takeover process , which is to introduce a general objectives of sustainable development - sdg , &apos; &apos; he said .
sdg will build on the progress that has been achieved in the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) and will be an integral part of the development program after 2015 .
i will make every effort to fulfill the mandate given to me by member states and implement our vision of sustainable development objectives , which builds on the success of the mdgs .
babiš : the government just sobotka .
andrei babiš is beginning to accept that his movement did not have time to learn the art of political opposition and that will have to be straight to governments to any occurred .
the president so it admitted in an interview for the law , which comes out tomorrow .
putin promised organic olympics , his secret plan by a giant landfill
winter sports fans have already cut feet into the opening of the olympic games in sochi , others on their training viewed with increasing fear .
the russian olympics , albeit starts up in february , is facing another scandal .
the russians seem to fail to fulfil the promise that the training and the organisation of the games in the least impede nature in the krasnodar krai in the foothills of the caucasus , where four months in the heads of thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors .
indeed , after the olympics in vancouver the russians had built the bar very high , the canadian games are etched in the history of the olympics as the most environmentally friendly .
however , it seems that the commitment of russian president vladimir putin &apos; s hold games with `` zero waste &apos; &apos; , took a long time ago .
associated press reporters last week discovered a giant landfill building material in the village of achštyr near sochi .
so the landfill full building material , tyres , jerry cans and insulation foam found in august , which environmentalists immediately reported .
the russian authorities all the landfill and disappeared .
but only for a moment .
last week , reporters looked to dump the size of three football fields .
is not the only one in the field of such places there were several , described the british newspaper the times .
work on the site of the russian railways , the state monopoly , which builds around šedesátikilometrovou route between the airport in sochi , and sports resort .
the company , which had already swallowed 280 billion rubles , led one of vladimir putin &apos; s close associates jakunin .
in august , the railways that prevented the landfill founded one of the subcontractors .
local people but they are desperate .
according to population achštyru around the village had three months to the day and night driving trucks full of waste material .
according to experts , there is a risk that the waste contaminates local river mzymtu , other streams and , eventually , the black sea .
`` the water from contaminating sočské water sources for the next 10 to 15 years , &apos; &apos; he told the british newspaper vladimir kimajev of environmental ngos ewnc .
illegal landfills are not the only problem the organising committee and the russian government .
the most expensive olympics in history , according to the opposition are one big tunnel .
for comparison , the games in sochi , will cost $ 51 billion , while the summer olympics in beijing 2008 came to 43 billion .
last year &apos; s game in london were only 19 billion and the vancouver nine billion .
in addition to the corruption scandals , project delays and fears , if in the end will be enough snow , reports emerged that at work in the exhibition venues and infrastructure to respect human rights .
last month , one of the workers sewed her mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months .
many are also worried about how the russian organisers during games more with the new law , which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality .
some visitors to the russian gay support at the olympics .
the rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in force for now in australia .
australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones during the start and landing and without regard to changes in the us for the relaxation of the rules on these devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) has space for american companies to change their practices , so that passengers will be able to on its facilities to read electronic books , watch video or play games during critical phases of flight when the device will remain in the `` air &apos; &apos; scheme .
passengers already this can do during most of the flight , but many people , that they can not have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing .
australian carriers to investigate this decision from u. s. carriers , which requires a great deal of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they are not in the plan to change their procedures .
the civil aviation safety authority ( casa ) also said that this notification to investigate , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in australia are still in force .
`` casa currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in the plane , &apos; &apos; he said .
this question is covered by the regulations , which require from aircraft operators to ensure that , for the entire period will be maintained and that the safety of the passengers are acting in accordance with the safety guidelines , which will acquire from members of the crew .
virgin , which has already with casa talked about extending the use of its on - board entertainment system wi - fi , was in favour of change , but announced that are subject to the decision of the regulatory authority .
`` we would welcome it if the casa has analyzed the permission to use electronic devices , because i really think it now , when we have the in - flight entertainment ( wireless ) , improved customer experiences , &apos; &apos; the spokesman said .
qantas announced that he would stick to the current legislation .
`` our current policy is such that electronic devices should not be used during take - off and landing , and we are not going to change that in the short term , &apos; &apos; he said .
faa rules apply to american airlines .
but she was still interested in the regulatory developments in the area , which can be useful for our passengers , and they will carefully study the faa decision and the reasons behind it are .
in the case of air carriers in the us , the impact of the legislation , the company will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet .
carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can not tolerate radio interference of mobile phones , and also to revise the manual training material , programs for hand luggage and information for passengers .
`` as soon as the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , passengers can afford to use portable and easy electronic devices , such as tablets and smart phones , electronic reader at any altitude , &apos; &apos; the faa said .
in rare cases , low visibility crew ordered passengers to during the landing gear off .
the group also recommended that was heavier equipment during take - off and the descent safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above his head .
nonsense in the film are gravity , but the show is a beautiful , say experts
a fantastic movie from the universe of gravity for some time after the premiere in the czech republic is not a movie .
in october saw him under the union film distributors nearly 150 thousand spectators and earned over 26 million crowns .
most of the reviews evaluated positively slide .
other in it , however , is a discrepancy .
the server lidovky . com asked experts from the astronomers and astrophysics at how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense , which appeared in the film .
george dusek ( director of the observatory and planetarium brno ) : i like science - fiction films , which i think is a modern , dreamlike fairy tales .
the film gravity included , even when they face a `` real physical performance . &apos; &apos;
it is not , but that does not mean that it was bad .
i enjoyed it very much .
you can see the need to sandra bullock &apos; s hair , which is kind of raises no in microgravity .
hubbův space telescope and the international space station are moving on significantly different orbits , and therefore can not be seen in one frame .
some of the spectators film complain unrealistically active effect and the behavior of fire in weightlessness .
the suits they also did not hold such wounds .
heroes in the film gravity often come into conflict with various objects and clothing without much trouble all hold .
the criticism was not spared the plotline .
so extensive tragedy to orbit the earth is , according to some people unrealistic .
in addition , wonders why dr was sent into space to repair technique .
people on the forums and arguing about the `` real &apos; &apos; behaviour of the ropes .
the supposed , as it was intended for bungee jumping .
marcel grüne ( director of the observatory and planetarium hl. m . ) : i saw him only on a broad canvas , but what i can say , i was charmed .
i am glad that it was not a film documentary , but science - fiction .
and in this story is the author of the law ( almost ) to keep the consistently reality .
`` more than you referred to irregularities me touching it , as is shown three times the space station with degrades the level of technology ( the last chinese ) . &apos; &apos;
`` china will indeed , until the end of the decade , and probably will look better than it is in the movie . &apos; &apos;
vladimir karas ( director of the astronomical institute of the academy of sciences of the czech republic ) : in the computer - generated scenes , the authors of the very successfully to disobey the laws of physics , and so přírodovědně oriented audience will appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and a quite rightly maintains momentum , said the dictionary of physics , also look at earth from space is very realistic , including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurora borealis flickering on the polar regions .
irregularities in a more detailed examination will be found .
additionally , for example , while reading the comments , he discovered that the preferred direction circulation of different space junk in orbit in some scenes appears to be reversed , than it should in fact be ( from west to east ) .
george stephen ( employee astronomical institute of the academy of sciences of the czech republic ) : some things makers adapt to their needs , but no substantive and blatant offense against the logic or the laws of nature in the movie and i noticed in comparison with other films like the focus is to see that the makers had credibility depicted events .
of those that do not make sense is worth it to appoint the fact that the hubble space telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than the iss .
the result is considerably different relative velocity and rescue operation would not in fact could take place , as depicted in the film .

the company &apos; s profit bombardier collapsed as a result of the decline in supply and orders
the canadian aircraft manufacturer bombardier and trains on thursday reported a 15 percent drop in net profit , which is caused by a smaller number of orders and deliveries of the aircraft in the third quarter and the problems in the unit .
bombardier , which is based in montreal also disclosed no data on air test for its new cseries aircraft type , or offering up - to - date information regarding whether this plane will comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next september .
after the opening test flight for about a month and a half ago , the aircraft was only three times and this raised the question of whether the test phase is progressing well .
the results have fallen short of forecasts and the shares on the stock exchange in toronto have decreased by 8 percent .
state bank analyst cameron doerksen declined thursday rating from `` higher returns &apos; &apos; to `` exercise &apos; &apos; sector with the expectation that the stock market will be during the next quarter or two with limited growth .
`` while the smaller aircraft deliveries are largely expected profit margin in the field of transport us very disappointed , &apos; &apos; said doerksen , in a report to clients .
with the way the test program will continue , we believe that the bombardier cseries aircraft gets new orders .
if , however , will not be in the coming months , reported no new orders , we assume that the market will increase scepticism towards this programme .
bombardier , hopes to fight their cseries aircraft type at the bottom of the market , which is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test plane was revealed in march , after months of delays in september , held the first years .
number of mandatory cseries aircraft orders , however , is modest 177 , because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to check the company &apos; s claim on the low consumption and savings on the cost of this transport aircraft .
currently , a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators .
executive director pierre beaudoin expected that , when the first aircraft to the commercial use of bombardier reaches its target of 300 orders mandatory .
the executives also on thursday assured analysts and the media that the programme is proceeding according to plan .
`` the plane was on the ground longer than expected , &apos; &apos; he said in the conference call beaudoin and noted that the examination on the ground and software updates are planned during the shutdown of the aircraft .
every manufacturer is planning to otherwise .
we decided to take the first flight and then go on to update and we did that .
it will happen during the entire flight programme .
according to bombardier , the second of five test aircraft to take off in the coming weeks and the other not long after .
analysts are still skeptical of that first customer could start to operate the cseries aircraft 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier says that his plan to evaluate the aircraft in service and in the coming months will provide updated information .
`` the slow pace of flight test - even though it is in accordance with internal plan bombardier - seemed to reinforce our view that the operation would be postponed for the first quarter of the year 2015 , &apos; &apos; said doerksen .
from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , in the previous year in the third quarter ending september 30 fell through the net profit of bombardier to 147 million , or 8 cents per share .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents .
turnover fell marginally from 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .

net orders fell from 83 aircraft at 26 .
outstanding contracts in the air division formed to 30 september 32.9 billion , which is unchanged at 31 december .
`` the results in aviation were in line with our forecasts , but low income orders and the overall state of the market failed us , &apos; &apos; said beaudoin .
revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the biggest producer of trains in the world , said that the proceeds in this division increased by almost 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
outstanding contracts in transport formed to 30 september 32.6 billion , compared to 31 december marginal growth .
the profit margin in the transport division has been affected by the problems with the implementation of several contracts .
the executives said that in the fourth quarter will be provided by the new projections .
