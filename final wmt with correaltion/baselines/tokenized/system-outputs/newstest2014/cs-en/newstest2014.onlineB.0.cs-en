mursi passed a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , the place that gave birth to the revolution that ended last year , mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule , and solemnly promised again that grasps the presidential powers taken from his office military council , which took over from the ousted leader .
but agrees with the composition of the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament , as is customary , surrendered to the will of the army , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .

frontier airlines is going to charge for carry-on luggage
frontier airlines plans during their flights to charge an amount equal to 100 usd for storing hand luggage on board .
frontier airlines plans to introduce a fee up to $ 100 per hand luggage and 2 usd for a coffee or a soda , although in its announcement on wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can .
the new fee for carry-on luggage involves baggage in the upper storage compartment , so little baggage under the seat will still be free .
frontier says it will charge 25 usd , if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 if passengers will be paying to wait until the coming of the gate .
a company spokesman frontier kate o &apos;malley said that hundred-dollar fee is to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance .
&quot; we do not want this fee chose , &quot; she said .
airlines have started to charge for first and second checked baggage in 2008 .
passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in the storage space , as much as she could , so in this area often lacked space .
fees are one way to teach passengers to get on board took less things .
o &apos;malley said that the purpose of this new fee really does not get more money .
the point is that the most loyal customers of frontier have clearly expressed that they find a place in the top storage compartment is increasingly difficult .
passengers who purchase flights on the company &apos;s website , do not pay .
this means that a passenger in line at the gate of the frontier can bring baggage that does not pay for anything , while the other passengers in the queue for the same bag will pay 100 usd .
o &apos;malley said that the website and clearance procedures shall be designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival at the gate .
new frontier fee for carry-on luggage is not yet in force before the summer , but the date has not been determined yet .
passengers often on fees for baggage and other fees complaining , but airlines love them .
he argues that the baggage handling cost money , and passengers who require this service , it would have had to pay .
many on wall street perceive additional fee for baggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses .
most but fees for carry-on baggage did not reach .
spirit airlines was the first monetization hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost airline allegiant air later followed her example .
the only company that has also such fees , the hungarian wizz air , says advisor in aviation jay sorensen , who closely monitors additional charges .
in its report of december 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage , spirit will bring $ 50 million annually .
sorensen , former chief executive of midwest airlines , recently flew with spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when traveling met with an unusual fees to spirit for carry-on luggage .
&quot; getting on the plane was the smoothest i have ever in my flying career saw , &quot; he said .
i was expecting the gate to see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and the advent took place in an instant . &quot;
frontier also modeled after the company &apos;s spirit apply charges for coffee , tea , soda and juice .
frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice , you can keep the whole jar and free coffee will be replenished .
water will continue to be served free of charge .
u.s. airways in 2008 , briefly tried to introduce charges for drinks , but after complaints from passengers that seven months later subsided and no other major airline nenapodobila it .
last frontier move to charge for carry-on luggage if the passenger does not purchase the flight directly from the airline , its latest attempt to direct customers directly to your website .
airlines pay internet travel sellers such as orbitz , 10 to 25 usd per each ticket sold .
this gave impetus to all airlines that have led passengers to purchase directly from them , rather than do it through online travel agencies .
frontier , in this field has gone away .
in september started giving customers who purchased through an internet travel agency , only half miles in a loyalty program .
on wednesday , crop it a reward for miles flown on 25 percent of the miles of paths .
so the way with 1,000 miles long frontier purchased through online travel agency means a reward of 250 million
the company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through the company website frontier .
frontier has in his hometown of denver loyal customer base , but its business is starting to shrink and lose money .
according to the financial results mentioned in the middle of the corporate partner of republic airways holdings revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity in the first quarter decreased by almost 13 percent
the company is selling this republic airlines just trying to solve the financial problems of society frontier .

one-fifth of the shopping center is struggling with low attendance
according to data from real estate consultancy cushman &amp; wakefield and jones lang lasalle .
in prague bohnice opens for the public trade centre krakow , will be the 19th prague shopping center .
there are presently a total of 90 major business centers .
unsatisfactory performance covers about 20 percent of medium and large centers .
the main problems are inappropriately large area to area and poor layouts , ie too many floors or complicated and confusing arrangement of passages , or dead space center , &quot; said michal soták of cushman &amp; wakefield .
also , according to head of retail agency at jones lang lasalle sylvie samadi is about a fifth of shopping centers struggling with low attendance .
the main reasons include , among others , poor accessibility , low income category of local residents or saturation of the market at a given location .
some projects opened almost fully occupied , but the results were mostly disappointing initially .
nowadays , customers are somewhat conservative and reluctant to change their buying habits .
new shopping centers must do more to &apos; lure &apos; their customers to new brands in the market , entertainment , service and marketing , &quot; said samadi .
availability of shopping centers , according to soták generally stable , even at some centers is rising because landlords were willing to compromise on the crisis in rent and dopronajmout some units .
&quot; it is true that recently opened some projects that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average availability ( eg breda &amp; weinstein opava , Šantovka in olomouc ) , &quot; he added soták .
business centers opened in the past two years the market promoted by sylvie samadi very slowly .
the market place for new projects but it exists .
number of sites suitable for construction of a successful project is very limited .
for example , in prague , we see room for construction of the project , which would serve the residents of prague 6
the market is definitely room for the construction of smaller local projects , the so-called &apos; convinience centers &apos; aimed at daily shopping and service needs of the population living in the neighborhood , &quot; said samadi .
also by sotak exists in the domestic market place for another shopping center .
and as for the little &apos; handler &apos; center and large projects in prague , medium or large projects or expansion in regional cities .
&quot; cities like kladno , czech budejovice , brno and plzeň have room for further growth , &quot; he added soták .
in prague , sees room for upcoming business center at victory square , as well as according to him , have a clear potential příkopě street and wenceslas square .
&quot; intensively developing expansion of retail parks , which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller cities for reasonable rent and operating costs , space is also still some areas for smaller local housing estate or shopping center , or their reconstruction such as the renovation of commercial buildings prior which benefits from a good location , &quot; said dita kubánková of dtz .
the czech republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area .
a quarter of these shopping centers are located in prague .
among the 20 largest shopping centers , according to the number of tenants , nine of them in prague , it is clear from the data incoma gfk .
the number of retail parks cr is below the eu average , compared with those of britain and france , czech lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants .

report : obama campaign considered to replace biden for hillary clinton
the closest adviser to president barack obama , according to the new york times considered secret ballot to replace the 2012 vice president joe biden for hillary clinton .
this revelation is the most eagerly awaited books sensation campaign 2012 by mark halperin and john heilemann &quot; double down : game change , 2012 . &quot;
magazine times acquired a copy incoming books and announced on thursday evening that the president held senior associates at the end of 2011 , an intensive group meetings and surveys to estimate whether the deprivation biden would help revive obama &apos;s fading hopes of re-election .
according to the national-political correspondent for the times magazine , jonathan martin , the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the white house , namely the former head of the white house of bill daley , to measure the impact on the elections should move former secretary of state clinton to post vice president .
the potential change was a closely guarded secret within the chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the oval office .
only a few of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including daley , the former head of the obama campaign , jim messina and former chief advisers in the white house , david axelrod and david plouffeho - known to be considering this change .
the book &quot; double down &quot; claims that daley was the leader of efforts to replace biden , despite their close personal relationship , until they finally decide not to make this move , when data showed that adding clinton to the candidate by &quot; obama &apos;s chances considerably increase &quot; .
in an interview with martin daley confirmed that the administration really considered replacing biden clinton .
&quot; i have intensively studied a variety of things and this was one of them , &quot; said daley for the list .
do not forget that at the time was president of the awful prospect , so we thought , &quot; christ , what shall we do ? &quot;
while daley described the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; martin told anderson cooper of cnn that the campaign for re-election has made considerable investments to determine whether this move pay off in the elections .
&quot; when campaigns to interpret that kind of money on elections and qualitative research , if something really serious does not consider , &quot; said martin on ac360 .
it is unclear whether obama knew that his team is considering this exchange .
martin told cnn that daley asked whether his former boss knew about this potential shuffling cards .
while daley said he does not think that the president of a potential change &quot; be aware &quot; , the former office manager admitted it was &quot; possible &quot; that obama knew about it .
martin added that the book &quot; double down &quot; definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe was given to obama on the table .
cooper asked martin if he really thought that obama did not know about the research on the removal of biden candidates .
&quot; maybe , &quot; said martin .
so no , mr. haske .
we have a unique opportunity to tell the politicians that follows not .
it is necessary to develop such pressure to martin hašek was deprived of all political office and left the parliamentary mandate .
any other solution will reduce the level of political culture , which is already very low .
martin hašek under the auspices of the promises he made , but each and policies need to be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise of a very consider what can promise .
trust is the only capital that has policies ( mr. babis has the material , but the question is whether the policy ) .
even the best program promoted a liar is not trusted .
in politics no excuse , politics is stepping down .
mr. hasko , if you mean well with this country ( and your frequent declarations that affirm me , so if you just lied - here you can see how difficult it is lying ) , leave politics alone , like a man .
people then take your apology as an expression of a man who made ​ ​ a mistake and bears its responsibility for it .
otherwise , you will be perceived as spineless wimp whose words or actions can not be trusted .
either you want to be proud , even erring man or life skete .
you may feel that it is unfair that i address only you , but you are the leader and they just misguided sheep .
a leader you are and have always wanted to be .
i understand that you &apos;re trying for a while folded ears , regroup , hatch the shame and then attack again , but so behave guerrillas or podrazáci .
you are , again , in their eyes , the leader , the alpha male , and so behave .
accept responsibility and walk away from politics .
the black box in your car ?
while american road planners are scrambling to find the money to repair crumbling highways , many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that fits easily into the dashboard of your car .
devices that monitor every mile that a motorist travels , and which transmit this information to the authorities , are at the core of the controversial efforts of washington and the office of state planning to renovate outdated system of funding of u.s. highways .
usually drab designing highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations .
libertarians met with groups and environmentalists lobbied for the government to be able to use these little boxes that record the mileage and maybe even where you go - and then would have used the information to build the tax base .
tea party is horrified .
the american civil liberties union is deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with privacy .
and while congress can not agree on whether to continue , some states are not waiting for anything .
figuring out how the next decade may move to a system in which the driver pays per kilometer road , which we follow .
thousands of motorists have black boxes , some of which are tracked by gps , take the test .
this is true for our nation need .
&quot; this is not a matter where we can collect much , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the state administration in southern california , for which the state plans to begin tracking mileage for every californian motorists in 2025 .
this changes the way we pay these taxes .
used to this technology .
the incentive is the fact that road trust fund financed by taxes that americans pay at the pump is at the bottom .
americans are not buying as much gasoline as before .
cars will drive more miles per gallon .
the actual federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon for the past 20 years has not increased .
due to the current high price of gasoline , politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by even a single cent .
&quot; the tax on gasoline is simply not sustainable , &quot; said lee munnich , an expert on transportation policy at the university of minnesota .
the state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test this system of payment per kilometer .
&quot; in the long term it seems like the most logical alternative , &quot; he said .
experts call it a user fee by the number of kilometers traveled .
it is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals , because taxes can be used to change the behavior patterns of drivers , for example , which can help reduce congestion and generation of greenhouse gases .
californian designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the ambitious targets set out in the law on global warming .
but rep. bill shuster ( representative of pennsylvania ) , chairman of the committee on transport , said it also sees as most functional long-term alternative .
representatives from the organization of the free market reason foundation are also open to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage .
&quot; it &apos;s not a tax , which disappears into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president of strategy in the organization reason .
people pay directly for what you get .
the initiative is also supported by two former secretaries of transport , who in 2011 urged congress to set out towards paying per mile .
the u.s. senate last year approved a pilot project for 90 million usd , which was to include about 10,000 vehicles .
the management of the house of representatives , however , rejected the proposal , and did so because of concerns rural legislators representing the components of population whose daily life is often offend many miles out of town for work .
several states and cities but still moving forward on their own .
ardent oregon is that the largest experiment in the country included 5,000 drivers .
these drivers will soon begin to pay state tax on mileage instead of gasoline taxes .
nevada has completed a pilot project .
new york just project explores .
illinois led the way to a limited extent , for freight wagons .
a coalition of i-95 , which includes 17 state ministries of transport , together with the coastal states in the east ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) studying how to implement this change .
this concept does not just advocate .
in nevada , which has recently been fitted with a device for about 50 cars , volunteers , drivers were concerned that the government is able to track their every move .
&quot; concerns about watching big brother type and similar issues were a major problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , who leads management strategy and operations at the nevada dot .
it was not something people wanted .
as a pilot project continued , the american civil liberties union in nevada on its website warned : &quot; it would be very easy to turn this device into a fully fledged tracking device . &quot;
there is no need to build a huge cumbersome technology infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the records of daily departures and arrivals individuals .
nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an available technology that would enable the state to keep track of how many miles the car moves , but not exactly when and where .
if you can , said khan , the public will be quieter .
hon on such technology has led some state agencies to small businesses in california called true mileage ( actual distance traveled ) .
the company initially into action to help the government taxing drivers not involved .
she wanted to break into an emerging market with liability insurance cover , where drivers would pay based on how many will drive .
but this device , which is trying to attract the attention of designers road network because not using gps and adds only a limited amount of information that is regularly uploaded through modem .
&quot; people will be more willing to go for it , if you do not watch their speed and their position , &quot; says ryan morrison , executive director of true mileage .
in some of these pilot programs , there were many big mistakes .
they are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it .
in oregon designers are experimenting with the fact that they give drivers a choice .
they can choose devices with gps or without gps .
or you may not take any device and instead opt to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of the country &apos;s population .
in other places they hope that prudent public on this concept accede if the device will be able to more , not less .
in new york with transportation officials are trying to develop tax device that was fitted so that in addition to paying fees for parking meters to provide insurance by mileage and to collect data on the speed of other drivers , so motorists can avoid traffic jam .
&quot; motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of benefits offered to them , &quot; says design document of the city .
some transportation planners would like to know , however , whether all the talk about pay per mile is not just a giant placeholder problem .
officials from the metropolitan transport committee in the san francisco bay area say that congress could issue bankrupt the road trust fund very easily solved by increasing taxes on gasoline .
one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid and other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel , so they will pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgery , when is enough to take aspirin , &quot; said randy rentschler , director of the committee on law and public affairs .
doing so , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things .
the billionaire who calls you next year ?
kellner , owner of ppf group , wants to buy the operator o2 .
both companies confirmed the meeting and according to various sources from agencies and backstage is said to have a hand in his sleeve .
notification of transactions should still come in november , probably before the auction of frequencies for lte networks , ie before 11 november .
kellner competitor karel komarek own conglomerate .
this is brand sazka telecommunications began to auction frequencies for lte networks .
and to everyone &apos;s surprise , until the flavors to penetrate the telecommunications companies talked about .
but sazka now leads a highly experienced telecommunications trouper robert chvatal .
he began as a marketing chief radiomobil ( now t-mobile ) , and later became the director of slovak t-mobile recently headed the austrian branch of the same operator .
betting play several cards at once .
he joined the auction and now admitted that he wants to run virtual vodafone .
and it makes sense .
if the auction is successful , so do their networks will be able to move existing customers on its own virtual operator .
it would probably normally not like vodafone , but according to the information hn daily , it can be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies .
vodafone currently suffering agreement with competing operators o2 and t-mobile , who will share their networks completely .
vodafone and partner needs .
and that may be the bet .
if that succeeds in the tender for lte networks ( as a novice may bid specially designed range ) and vodafone on the auction may not run at all , or he will not mind a limited spectrum auction ( not enough frequencies for all ) .
vodafone is the bets on the network share .
vodafone releases a stake into its 2g / 3g network ( or newly built lte network at a frequency of 900 mhz ) , allowing quick start enterprise networks .
sazka between starts to build expensive lte network , which will also use vodafone .
can be satisfied both companies .
money saved by vodafone could then spend a provider of solid internet or cable television .
the kellner ?
he would buy czech and slovak o2 ( slovak czech branch is the daughter ) got immediately a full-fledged operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services .
but on the other hand , it is a great juggernaut that will wait restructuring .
the auction by lte networks have gained kellner for o2 and very probably in conjunction with t-mobile .
both the company has already declared that the network will be shared .
auctions could then finally a success , but probably not enough high amounts , which enjoys state budget .
and from next year , so customers in the czech republic could choose between calling vodafone , t-mobile , kellner or komarek .
or two titans of czech business against global giants .
greenpeace activists detained in russia transported to st. petersburg
environmental activists detained since september in russia due to protest against the planned oil production in the arctic were airlifted from murmansk to st. petersburg .
informed today afp , referring to the international environmental organization greenpeace .
she also claims that the original accusations of piracy of its activists have not yet been downloaded .
&quot; greenpeace international has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in russia for non-violent action against the oil rig in the arctic , was transported from the detention center in murmansk in prison in st. petersburg , &quot; said the organization in a statement .

the authorities initially accused environmentalists of piracy , which for them in the event of conviction faced up to 15 years in prison .
last week but announced that it will replace the more moderate hooliganism charges for which the risk of a reduced sentence of a maximum of seven years imprisonment .
greenpeace but in today &apos;s statement pointed out that the charges of piracy authorities have so far not withdraw , as promised .
this apparently means that detainees are now accused of two offenses .
powerful committee of investigation announced last week that the charges of piracy replace charges of disorderly conduct .
but when thirty prisoners appeared before the committee this week , accused of piracy was withdrawn .
instead , everyone was against the new allegations , &quot; afp quoted a statement from greenpeace .
russians detained in oil rig company gazprom in mid-september , three dozen members of greenpeace coming from 18 countries .
environmentalists were on the ship arctic sunrise , which was sailing under the dutch flag .
since then , all being held in custody , against which filed an appeal , but the court rejected them all .
the conditions of detention of the environmentalists complain .
greenpeace executive director kumi naidoo by afp said today that the move to st. petersburg facilitate meetings with the families of detainees with consular staff .
however , there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in murmansk .
&quot; in fact , they may be worse , &quot; he said .
for assistance asked the dutch king willem-alexander , one of the detained activists faiza oulahsenová .
in a handwritten letter released today by the algemeen dagblad list , monarch invited to talk about their situation at the planned meeting with russian president vladimir putin .
lawyer addicted to cocaine , which warned of the mafia before the police investigation is in jail
bashar ditta ( 42 ) should forward information to the king of the underworld neil scarbrough .
the lawyer feared that his addiction comes to light .
liverpool crown court sentenced him to three years in prison .
top defense attorney , who informed the drug mafia a large police investigation because he feared that his drug addiction comes to light , was sentenced to three years in prison .
bashar ditta ( 42 ) had after he became suspicious of cocaine underworld boss neil scarbrough transmitting sensitive information about the investigation into his activities related to drug trafficking .
the lawyer , whose nickname was &quot; bash &quot; ( party ) and that criminals were hailed as the best legal representative , after police monitoring scarborough , which in earlier proceedings relating to narcotics represented , in 2011 , was arrested at his home .
officers saw sarborougha ( 32 ) as allowed in the lawyer &apos;s house in blackburn , lancashire , who was just out to dinner with colleagues from the law society , three bags of cocaine .
on the basis of tests in which they found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and his credit card , the investigation revealed that ditta was a regular drug user class a .
during a period of eight months , from january to august 2011 , trying to surreptitiously obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of scarborough and his companion .
all four suspects were at the time observed in the major investigations of trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the areas of lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
once during a series of raids police seized heroin and cocaine worth about £ 1.5 million , together with 200 000 gbp in cash , in prison with them resulted in a further 32 people .
ditta ( 42 ) passing information to criminals fear that comes to his addiction to cocaine .
today ditta , who works at the law firm forbes solicitors based in blackburn , has experienced before liverpool crown court shameful moment when , after a three-week trial found guilty of that in the two cases impede the course of justice .
during an earlier hearing pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine .
lawyer &apos;s fall occurred after at scarborough police investigation found that he was in february 2011 in regular telephone contact with the child .
two detectives suspect watched , recorded his arrival in dittova house and saw him put drugs with a purity of 60 percent of the lawyer &apos;s basket in black golf glove .
subsequently , scarborough with ditto , who was having dinner at a football stadium blackburn rovers at ewood park , a regular telephone interview .
lawyer returned home where drugs found , and between the two parties was nine interviews .
in court it was said that it found traces of class a drugs in his hair , his wallet and credit cards and that ditta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of cocaine .
ditta was later arrested , but denied use of cocaine , and said he spoke with the suspected dealer because it was his client , and argued that their conversation falls into a &quot; confidential communication &quot; .
during his arrest ditta took his wallet and tried to remove her from several credit cards , but they were all arrested and had his hair samples .
during police questioning he said that ran the office as your home address , workplace , and that it clients due to work issues attended at home .
the court heard , however , that the key arrests contacted the major players in the drug supply chain , some of which had represented , to tell them what detectives know about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : &quot; who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than attorneys in criminal cases . &quot;
mr ditta is accused of abuse of his position of legal representative , and the fact that he was in very close contact with a particular client .
relationship , we &apos;re talking about here , is not just a drug dealer , but the drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer drugs .
some of the interviews were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was his lawyer .
but it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship .
police investigations thwarted as most could enable them to continue their criminal activities .
mr ditta their profession &apos;s reputation brought , might dishonor .
with certain their clients are too close to , especially with scarborough , and allowed to be compromised its independence .
ditta offense refused and said : &quot; if i were a corrupt lawyer , which i &apos;m not , and i would like mr. scarborough submit information , i would expect 15 hours , but i would do it immediately . &quot;
after the hearing , however , the police inspector lee halstead from lancashire said : &quot; mr ditta of attorney in the criminal justice field itself became a criminal when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction made ​ ​ him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime , which gave him the task to collect valuable information about the police investigation .
legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and to inspire confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on .
mr ditta this trust betrayed and tried to hide behind the cloak of their profession .
unit for serious and organized crime in lancashire led the investigation against mr. ditto , on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice , which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the hand of the law .
we will find you and stand before our courts .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
another thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were arrested a total of 153 years for drug offenses .
on its website ditta about yourself organized online interview in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients on death row in america , as a guest at a dinner he wished mohammed ali as a motivation for the work stated inequality .
obama is backing away from health care
after a wave of criticism of president obama yesterday backed away from his ambitious and often-repeated promise that &quot; if you like your health program , you can have it . &quot;
with reference to the announcement , hundreds of thousands of testimonies from providers republicans in recent days accusing the president of misleading the american public .
yesterday obama from his original promise flinched .
&quot; the vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
with regard to what he called a &quot; media fuss &quot; about the statements , obama called on americans who have received this notification , the search of new business in the market .
most people will be able to have a better , more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even cheaper than expected .
&quot; you get a better deal , &quot; he said .
his administration says it would not be surprising that 5 percent of the population that have purchased insurance for themselves , may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the law of available care .
&quot; i say to those americans face it : you deserve something better , &quot; said sebeliusová in his testimony before the committee on energy and commerce in washington .
sebeliusová , which oversees the implementation of the law on available care , said the launch of the internet market in october was &quot; miserable &quot; .
&quot; i am disappointed and upset as everyone else , &quot; she said .
i &apos;ll try to get back your confidence .
irritated sebeliusová this sentence , which captured the microphone is switched on , she spoke yesterday towards advisors who sat behind her at yesterday &apos;s meeting of the committee , held after a stormy exchange with republican billy long , a representative from missouri , which related to whether she must involved in the obama care program .
more than three-hour hearing on sebeliusovou repeatedly pestered the question of why the &quot; architect &quot; of the law of available care voluntarily give up the government-sponsored insurance , and have not purchased the program through healthcare.gov , which now imposes millions of americans .

number infected with hiv has exceeded a thousand in prague
in the czech republic the number of infected is growing every year .
for example , in 2002 , tests confirmed infection in 50 people , five years later , there were 121 and in 2010 there were already 180
last year there were 212 infected and it was a record number .
&quot; the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 , has , in my opinion there is no doubt , &quot; said the expert on aids miroslav hlavaty , who for years led the lighthouse in prague for patients .
according to him , last year , from january to september were added in the country of 165 patients with hiv , this year over the same period there were 176
since the beginning of the study until the end of september this year confirmed hiv tests at 1,710 men and 353 women , with most infected were in prague .
their number reached in september 1005 .
in the central region had 206 infected residence .
diagnosis and listened to 156 people from the southern region , 130 or 116 of the moravian of the usti .
at least infected comes from the highlands , there were 19
in total 88 percent of patients infected during sex .
fourteen people in the past have been infected through blood transfusion .
such a case , however , since the beginning of testing , ie for more than a quarter century in the czech republic appeared .
the hiv virus is also born six children , transferred to them from the mother .
children should learn the myths and legends as &quot; a model for the way of life , &quot; says the author .
stories about thor can show that &quot; brute force is not equal clever cunning &quot; , while the arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream .
a large part of the myth &quot; to teach at the school was too wild , too scandalous , and in some cases too obscene , &quot; said crossley-holland , which advocates a careful selection of works appropriate age .
&quot; i think it &apos;s great that myths and folk art are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i defended the plan for twenty years .
he added that &quot; openly pontificating &quot; authors and teachers are at engaging story with a &quot; subliminal &quot; message to children as &quot; switch &quot; .
crossley-holland , which translated from the anglo-saxon epic beowulf and who also writes the norwegian myths ( penguin book ) and the british national fable says : &quot; you may have good intentions , but you are better off having them for myself . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes adult and adult author who writes for children need some sense of hope .
not that everything needs to be simplified or end up happy ending , but there must be a natural sense of good and evil .
and it must be subconscious ; revealed through the story , not openly set .
the old truth that it is better to show than to describe .

&quot; she and her husband have just bought a house and gave out all their money , &quot; says ms. amirthalingaová .
although each month as administrator receives $ 2,400 ( 3000 sgd ) and her husband also works , family monthly income is insufficient , he says .
demand across regions in southeast asia - where increasing household debt - is indeed such that the company valuemax where a woman carries out its transactions , this week became the stock exchange of singapore pawnshop third on the ladder .
stop the jewelry is not only quick way to cash rent - 1300 sgd in the case of mrs. amirthalingaové - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
pawns in singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent , just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by the bank , united overseas bank , a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center .
pawn however , have the advantage of not requiring verification of the person ( payment history ) or proof of income , and can provide a loan faster than banks .
and so with the way families are feeling the strain due to the increasing cost of living and growing household debt and consumer debt , millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers .
after five years of vigorous growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap loans supported by loose monetary policy in advanced economies families with low and middle-income countries are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation .

malaysia is on the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of gdp , up from 60 percent in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in thailand , which this week only just got out of technical recession .
on thursday , data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand .
&quot; it is essential that the rising cost of people from middle to low &#91; income scale &#93; will try to supplement their income , wherever they can , &quot; said song seng wun , economist at malaysian bank cimb .

people say the price of gold looks good stop her grandmother &apos;s gold necklace and get it back next month .
the largest operator of pawnshops in thailand , easymoney , recorded in recent months to a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using his pawn .
growth in the pawnshop industry is so large that valuemax , the operator of a branch in the city and 15 bendemeer similar in singapore , plans to expand not only in neighboring malaysia - which has four branches - but also outside asia , says executive director valuemax yeah lee ching .
the company will finance it using 60 percent of 66 million sgd , which this week won the singapore stock exchange .
while some discount lenders found themselves under fire because of high interest , ms. yeah says arrest not only offer lower rates than other lenders , but also directly increase the debt .
&quot; customers stop objects that already own a realization of the personal property does not increase household debt , &quot; he says .
the company has pledged assets is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure the short-term , secure funding .
among those who use pawnshops , moreover , are not the only people in financial distress .
wealthy people from singapore also use branch valuemax when stop bars or rolex watch , and they can not reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
our customers are from all backgrounds .

he said the newspaper notw used three methods to investigate stories : hacking into the phone , watching a confrontation .
editor is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows about the other , watching , he must know .
and what about the first ?
he knows about hacking into the phone ?
he says no , we say : &quot; of course he does . &quot;

ben greenman : the tenth anniversary of the new york comedy festival : new yorker
it could be argued that the city of new york is a place where born in america solo comic performances : a hundred years ago entertainer frank fray , who served as chairman of the ceremonies in the palace theatre on broadway , crowds began to tell jokes by interview .
fay innovation has expanded over the years , most recently through the new york comedy festival .
festival founded and managed by caroline hirsch , founder of the institution solo carolines comedy , celebrates its tenth anniversary - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs or large theaters .
&quot; most of these titles appeared in the carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played in the club , &quot; said hirsch .
this festival , we have created a way to continue to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes performances by wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher , as well as &quot; stand up for heroes &quot; ( stand up for heroes ) , the annual benefit musically comedic performance at madison square garden , which will , among other bruce springsteen , jon stewart , roger waters and bill cosby .
like this festival has spread , has expanded the world of comedy .
several comedians participating in the festival this year came from non-traditional channels such as show in smaller radio or television companies , such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll swung his sitcom ( happily spicy &quot; league &quot; in fantastic football-theme of the fxx ) and now has its own comedy show on comedy central station .
jenny slateová was a member of both the program &quot; saturday night live &quot; and &quot; parks and recreation &quot; , but the most famous fast-moving series of videos &quot; marcel the shell with shoes on &quot; ( marcel mussels in boots ) .
how kroll and slateová , as well as other young comedians with a clearly recognizable voices ( surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , acerbic , racialized w. kamau bell ) , are the product of the decentralized world of american comedy .
one of the biggest draw of the festival is the interview : david steinberg will talk with larry david .
steinberg began as a standup comedian , but became a successful television and film director , as well as the unofficial historian of comedy .
from 2005 to 2007 , held at the station tv land show called &quot; sit down comedy with david steinberg . &quot;
the meeting was held at the town hall in midtown manhattan .
&quot; this city is definitely in the comedy larry entire dna work , &quot; said steinberg .
he told me that he &apos;s here , sometimes going through the alley between the two buildings and you think , man , if i lose all the money i might live here .
many things moved , and otherwise .
maybe pečinka commentator spoke so that it could agree with that , but the chairman Štěch fanned discord .
governor chovanec i was suspicious as soon as he was elected to the board and confirmed this .
chairman sobotka always been a symbol of the poverty cssd continue .
other gentlemen performed mainly for their weaknesses .
senator dienstbier &apos;s consistent and readable and unusable , vice zaorálek is impossible for most television interview .
on that basis , i see no better option than to propose for the social democrats senate vice prime minister gajdůšková , the only handicap would not start and i think it did a standard of performance .
this is such a good deal that barely anyone from management support .
i would add that this solution is the only way to forget what you did , and continue without tearing the party .
alena gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with just a blessing from the president of the babis and without the christian democrats , but lidoveckým health minister hovorka , which is actually a faithful social democrat .
the government should minimenšinová great stability , as advocated by the proper law on referendum and so committed to promoting the chairman of the dawn okamura .
chairman babiš would eventually reconciled with the progression of taxes , because he is smart and sees that it does not go without it .
the christian democrats would have never presented problems because hovorka is the bearer of the best of what they have , and the government would otherwise have been .
the same is true of yes , there could be found a valuable minister , but he wisely do not want to enter into risky government participation , but provide support , also good .
let &apos;s add the courage to alena gajdůšková !

concerns about the safety of mozambique are increasing due to a conflict of strong personalities
below the statue of samora machel , the mozambican president of the founder , in the heart of maputo gathered thousands of people to the rare public demonstration chanted peace password .
&quot; we want to back peace , we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , executive director of the investment company .
out of fear for the future of their country exchanged business clothes for t-shirt decorated with the words &quot; require safety &quot; in portuguese and joined the crowd on thursday at the independence square in the capital .
after two weeks came almost daily reports of conflict between government forces and the party renamo , one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once notorious rebel movements , originally supported by the white man &apos;s government in rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in south africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of that country .
after the peace agreement in 1992 became the opposition party .
analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the country again broke out into open conflict , but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and local .
at stake is a rapidly growing economy , since the discovery of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest can over the next few years bring for companies such as rio tinto and brazil &apos;s vale , the italian eni and the american anadarko , investments worth more than $ 50 billion .
the ruling frelimo party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and renamo blame each other from the resulting voltage .
renamo party says the government provoked the latest conflict by 17th september launched an attack on their members in the province of sofala , the traditional stronghold pages renamo .
violent attacks on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the base side of renamo and tried to kill afonso dhlakamu , the group &apos;s leader , told the financial times renamo spokesman fernando mazang .
the government blames for the start of conflict renamo , because apparently attacked the soldiers .
president armando guebuza tried to alleviate fears of instability .
mr guebuza for the french news agency afp said wednesday that mr. dhlakama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remained of his forces in an attempt to prove that the government can order their own decisions . &quot;
how frelimo and renamo claims that they want to avoid war .
but concerns grew when it was quoted words of mazang that renamo party withdraws from the peace agreement of 1992 .
list ft said that he meant that frelimo party has not respect the agreement .
&quot; our goal is to return to negotiations , but with seriousness , &quot; said mr. mazang .
previous talks between the parties have made to alleviate the tension between the parties , fomenting a series of skirmishes this year , just a little .
it &apos;s a dogfight between two great personalities ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , said a lecturer at the open university and an expert on mozambique joseph hanlon .
neither of them is not a good negotiator , and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
renamo party that sought to change the election , have indicated that they boycotted the municipal elections scheduled for november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted as an attempt to force the moribund movement to get government benefits and financial recovery .
electoral share renamo party since 1992 decreases , while the newer party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( dhm ) , which was founded by a former member of the party renamo , as expected , its position in the elections will improve .
pan mazang says that mr. guebuza - which ends next year second term - he wants to destroy democracy in this country .
&quot; he does not want a democratic multi-party system does not want transparent elections , does not want peace because they will not let the presidency , &quot; said mazang .
it is unclear what options renamo party has , but carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between the north and south .
most skirmishes occurred in the province of sofala , which is to say , several hundred kilometers away from the capital city of maputo , but where is the city of beira harbor , which rely on mining companies including rio tinto and vale at its coal exports .
in june , rio suspended for about a week , rail use , when the party renamo threatened that this line of attack .
pan mazang not want to rule on whether renamo repeated his threat .
renamo wanted to &quot; warn the international community that the situation in mozambique is not good , &quot; said mazang .
instability increased frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of an independent media company mediacoop , and many people also worried about the corruption , the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings .
&quot; people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is borne entirely by the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to problems , &quot; he says .
a protester omar sultuane says people just want stability .
&quot; nobody cares nor renamo or frelimo , just turn people want peace , they want to have free access to the road , &quot; he says .

aircraft manufacturers dispute the width of the seats at stake are large contract
among the leading aircraft manufacturer with the controversy erupted about the width of the seats in the second class for long haul flights , which this month gave rise bitter exchange of views at an air show in dubai .
the dispute is over the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class - not just the one you would normally preceded by airlines , but for which the allocated space is the key to the demands of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by airbus sas and boeing .
airbus this week called for industry standards , which would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class , but the main u.s. rival boeing says about how to choose the airline .
controversy arose when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the biggest selling version of its twin-engine aircraft with a potential remote record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 november .
this is how the back of the plane layout - especially if the adjacent 9 or 10 seats - is the basis of economic performance demands on proposals for new aircraft &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; .
boeing says that the improved model &quot; 777x &quot; transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spaced 10 in each row .
airbus says that the competitive version of the model a350 delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic spaced seats after 9
the giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media .
airbus now before the air show in dubai , which is expected to 777x gain an advantage with more than 100 orders , appeals directly to the public .
recently preliminarily showed what could be the start of a new advertising war , when financiers showed an image showing three people in a crowded restaurant with the caption &quot; they let you enjoy it ? &quot;
&quot; boeing promotes long-haul flights in the seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft , &quot; said sales manager airbus john leahy .
how is the food ark shells , people are more , but seats on planes radically changed .
since the beginning of the 70th years , the boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-distance air transport , the turn of the century , according to the ministry of health usa the average weight of americans aged 40-49 years increased by 10 percent .
according to u.s. health statistics , the average american in the 21st century at the waist 100 cm .
airbus claims its rival , the concept holds seats in the 50 years , the average width of the newly baptized seat aircraft was lower .
airbus says it has carried out research which suggests that extending the seats of 2.5 cm improve sleep quality by 53 percent .
boeing dimensions seat airbus refuses and says he is not under the jurisdiction of aircraft manufacturers decide on how airlines exports fees and equipment .
the company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat .
&quot; really it comes down to give airlines flexibility and allow them to do things that they believe that they must do to be successful , &quot; said the expert cab space kent craver .
they do not want to let them dictate what brings them profit .
they know their business better than anyone .
for passengers more space is essential for the elbow , but the vendor is a growing problem that can affect yields .
in this dispute , the plant in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $ 700 billion at list prices , enough to tip the scales swung american and european exports .
as stated in july , reuters , the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft .
as airbus and boeing argues that achieved by its recent proposals twin-engine long-haul aircraft by 20 percent better efficiency than the leader of the market in this segment model boeing 777-300er with 365 seats .
the performance requirements of boeing depends in part on a comparison of the design model 777x with 10 seats in a row and the concept 777 with 9 seats in a row .
profit in unit costs compared 10sedadlovému concept weakened .
&quot; the reason why boeing is doing is so crammed more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared to our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , leading to passenger comfort in the company of airbus for europe .
on the other hand , analysts say the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers is denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees .
&quot; forty-five centimeters wide seat passengers would be great , but the reality is that the business case for airbus proposal is motivated by the threat model 777 , &quot; said an expert on interior cabins mary kirby , founder and editor of the portal runway girl network .
airbus and boeing are not supplied seats , but offer airlines catalogue of suppliers , so that they can choose .
scestovalí dealers aircraft even with me wearing a measuring tape to check the competitive arrangement .
while boasting comfort , all manufacturers also offers aircraft with highly dense arrangement for low-cost airlines and regional travelers .
airbus a350 offers a model with 10 seats in a row , but says it still did not sell .
until recently , airbus emphasized the need for greater editing booths so that it offered some of their aircraft with wider seats in the aisles .
experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft call for new industrial standards will remain unheard , but may deter from wool sales 777x .
cme will target the television business .
pass almost a quarter of the people .
media group cme will leak .
by the end of the year wants to slim down a thousand people .
plans to scale back all side activities and wants to focus only on their core business , television .
the group , which owns the czech tv nova and also operates in the slovak republic , bulgaria , romania , croatia and slovenia , employs about 4,500 people .
the work comes as almost a quarter of the people .
the group operates a television in the czech republic , the slovak republic , bulgaria , romania , croatia and slovenia .
cme is part of cet 21 , which holds the license to broadcast television stations nova , nova cinema , nova sport , flip , smíchov , heavy and czech version of mtv .
how much savings czech affect where the group employs about 650 people , and what it will mean for domestic television leader tv nova , is not yet clear .
&quot; it is premature and we really can not comment , &quot; said communications director josef novy koukolíček .
according to the mf dnes with significant layoffs czech republic definitely avoided , but by far the greatest impact it would have on staffing level cme branches in romania and other countries .
the two new bosses novy christoph mainusch and michael del nin , who took over from longtime director adrian sarbuovi during wednesday &apos;s conference call with analysts talked about how they want to limit any activity that is not directly related to the television business .
it is therefore quite likely that significantly reduce the cost of production especially own programs , film and production activities .

george kerevan : divided europe gives the scots a choice
another day , another creepy story about independence .
this time it appears warning that a condition for membership of an independent scotland in the eu would be his entry into the schengen area .
this gave rise to stories about passport checks in berwick and barbed wire along hadrian &apos;s wall .
the truth is that newspapers strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of europe , but - as expected - it did not translate into newspaper headlines .
no one also mentioned that the eu member states spend a lot of time by adapting their official acts unless it suits them .
given that scotland is now in schengen , offer continuing non-compliance would be to brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the scots really want .
so it &apos;s a pretty weak story .
and so old that it had become obsolete . canard that &quot; independence means passport control , &quot; i heard at least 40 years ago .
yet in this tale bearded hides an interesting idea .
why should not be expected that an independent scotland will listen to europe ?
why replace the collar for the london brussels , especially now ?
this is a true european story : great postwar plan to unify europe finally failed .
the crisis of the euro is the so-called project europe officially dead .
across europe gain influence party insiders resistance to the eu or cancellation of the euro as a common currency .
even in germany eurosceptic party alternativa for germany - started this year - came out of nowhere and had a federal election in september seized nearly five million votes , making the bundestag essentially &quot; swept &quot; free democrats ( the equivalent of the british liberal democrats ) .
the home has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , has become a defining moment .
the economy dictated by germany and the european central bank , together with the straightjacket inserted on the national economy through adherence to a common currency have led many people to think that the project europe has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with high budget deficit - this was true only in the case of greece .
rather , it is a system of the euro , which blocks its members on exchange rates favorable for german exporters - and a german politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency has southern europe in the field of domestic production compared to germany disadvantage .
the only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure - which encourages germany .
in the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of the languid performance .
as a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policy supported by brussels - code for the support of the french and german companies at the expense of consumers - the european industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the united states .
this is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost , as we have seen in the case of grangemouth .
not all frozen salaries in the world by stomping reversing the european petrochemical industry inexpensive slate oil usa .
the result is a simmering insurgency , especially in france , once enthusiastic supporters of the eu .
after the war , the political elite in france saw the eu as a tool that will keep germany in check and allow paris to stand up in the world of the washington level .
berlin but had paris as the id card does not need political legitimacy and enforced in europe its own economic policy and worn french economy left to its fate .
result : right wing marine le pen , anti-european national front , has just won a major additional options and postponed the ruling socialists in third place .
the queue is now 24 % of the vote the most popular party in france - an early warning to the british labour party that they can not conclude that splitting the right is automatically reflected positively on the left .
as le pen handled his newfound popularity among working-class white man ?
european elections next year would like to use to cross the european parliament created the anti-european bloc directed against the common currency .
if you are anti-european parties in these elections will lead well , which is likely , such a block for the first time in the history of the european parliament dominate .
me at that idea , that in the foreseeable future , a growing anti-european feeling and stance against the common currency euro together and destroy him .
eu will not disappear , but rather to transform into something freer in the sense of &quot; europe ( sovereign ) nations &quot; who prefer to general de gaulle .
germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro , but france and southern europe restores its own currency .
i expect that the uk from this project will dissociate and latches on to the united states .
however , increased interest in washington for the pacific suggests that britain will be left cold atlantic .
and where will scotland ?
we can choose to be an area ( in principle ) little england .
or we can defend its own economic interests - in the fall and the opportunity to make berlin and brussels , where we have to let go .
i assume that scotland would in a relaxed configuration of europe did well , provided that it retains its own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should take an example from norway and retain their economic independence .
snp government in scotland is - surprisingly - the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in europe that won a large majority in 2011 because of opposition stance against cuts planned ( and implemented ) labour chancellor alistair darling and subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats .
it would be ridiculous if scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures dictated by berlin and brussels .
the parents of intersex children can choose &quot; indeterminate gender &quot;
germany became the first european nation to recognize third gender in children born with ambiguous genital tract .
newborn children will no longer be ordered only either male or female gender .
the new law does not require parents to allow for such children reported any gender , and allows them to bring their birth certificates sex as &quot; indeterminate &quot; or &quot; unspecified &quot; .
the act aims to stop pushing on parents to contact their child &apos;s hastily decided on surgery to determine the sex , and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexed .
one intersex person by the bbc for many years , said : &quot; i am neither male nor female . &quot;
i will remain a patchwork created by physicians , bruised and scarred .
it is estimated that each year from 2000 children born to one that is neither boy nor girl .
they are intersexed , part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testes ) or abnormally developed genitalia .
intersex can be wallis simpson .
determining the sex is not yet fully understood , but most experts in the united states says that you can not determine the sex , it &apos;s better to use the best available information and determine them , instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until it is done before operations , if at all .
new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in problems with the determination of sex , said the new german law &quot; seems like a good thing . &quot;
intersex children pose an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery , but most children it is not , &quot; he said .
sex determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait and see how identity develops .
knowledge of how a child develops gender , is not very accurate .
nobody can answer the question of why this is happening .
it &apos;s a mystery why some people are gay .
report submitted to the european committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender but on their biological structure that is not exclusively or male or female , but typically consists of two and can not be clearly defined as either one of them .
these features may occur in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , hair growth , breast and body , in primary sexual characteristics , such as the reproductive organs and genitals , or structure of chromosomes and hormones .

boys not conforming to gender now have a special camp .
australia and nepal already allow adults to mark the official documents of male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; .
norrie may-welby , 52letá australian who in june became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; sexless &quot; person when she won judicial appeal , that you can keep for life status &quot; indeterminate &quot; sex .
according to the ministry of the interior will have german passports in addition to m ( male ) and f ( female ) and the third sign , x , and for intersex people .
in neighboring france , according to news reports on france 24 issue of gender is still controversial .
in 2011 , dozens of french lawmakers from the strongly catholic country signed a petition demanding that the school textbooks were removed &quot; theory of gender &quot; .
american catholic website online is against german law also define and wrote : &quot; with the way the world is dragged to a new situation , where sex is a matter of choice , but not sexual activity , they turn upside down the other two pillars of civilization . &quot;
one mother of a newborn maryland also told the baby zone that would rather see that children assigned sex at birth .
&quot; parenting is stressful itself , without other limitations , especially if you do not know the sex of their child , &quot; expressed for websites related to parental care .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites , according to a handsome greek who had a double sex .
a dozen years earlier , the medical community believed that sex is something like a board that can erase and redraw again .
but now many question the ethical basis of operations that sexual identity is a complex matter and doctors sometimes choose incorrectly , because they do not know how to respect their sex , children will feel when they grow up .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century it was called the psychiatric emergency room , &quot; said drescher .
when these children were born , did you call a psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
persisting theories about how to deal with children with ambiguous sex , was presented by dr. john money at johns hopkins university , who argued that gender is malleable .
created a new concept of &apos; sexual competence &quot; and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment - how parents raise their child - were the children &apos;s genes and hormones and shape the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman .
but in one case from 1966 , known as &quot; john / joan &quot; , his theory became controversial .
the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision recommended that your child is left completely neutered , removed his testicles and raised him as a girl .
&quot; the media presented this case as a successful case of conversion , but the reality was different , &quot; said drescher .
when the boy was 15 years old , got přeoperovat back at the boy and married to a woman .
in 38 years , committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors &quot; this model using &quot; today .
but in the 90th years , with the advent of the internet , the survivors of these operations appeared &quot; unhappy with the results . &quot;
it was the case with jim bruce , 36letého writer from montana , who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous genital tract .
doctors were not sure whether a large clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that such a man could never live a &quot; life satisfaction &quot; .
and so shortly after his birth in 1976 were bruce surgically removed by external bodies and testes and was raised as a girl .
in 12 years , got female hormones .
&quot; i knew that i was not a girl , &quot; he told abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was very difficult to ask .
at 18 he was sent on a plastic sheath .
but because he was depressed and knew something was wrong , he asked for medical records .
what they found was horrifying .
after the birth i was sterilized and nobody ever said anything .
bruce was born with a disorder of sex development ( dsd ) , which prevent the body to produce enough testosterone to make the right to develop his genitals .
after he learned the truth , turned back to the man , took doses of testosterone and had to remove the bust ,
the operation caused the infertility .
today represents another in an organization called project interface and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexed .
but anne tamar-mattisová , director of the legal group advocates for informed choice ( supporters informed choice ) based in california , is worried that the german act &quot; calls for calibration and stigmatům &quot; .
&quot; many activists are concerned that german law ensures that encourages parents to do a quick decision and choice for baby , vague , &apos; &quot; she said .
we are afraid that it prompts for intervention .
we believe that it is better to assign male or female , and then wait .
but we do not know how the law eventually confesses so all we can do is speculate .
tamar-mattisová said her organization supports australian law because it &quot; allows adults to choose to be included into the third sex &quot; .
&quot; adults should be able to make a legally valid decision of their own sex , &quot; she said .
german law is going to assign it at birth .
this is a battle we would at this point not to seduce a young child .
when they grow up , they may by your own body to make its own decisions .
but dr. arlene baratzová , radioložka chest of pittsburgh , who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group , said the german law , &quot; grant powers &quot; both parents and children .
baratzové daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but the dsd called androgen insensitivity syndrome .
because the androgen receptors are defective , we developed katie feminine features .
my vagina , but not the uterus and ovaries .
now the 29 year old katie married in studies at the university of pennsylvania , working as an intern at a children &apos;s psychiatric ward .
although barren , hopes to become parents through adoption or surrogacy .
&quot; the law gives parents a space to make its decision in no hurry , &quot; said baratzová .
it gives them time to make some tests and change your mind and gives them time to write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female &quot; .
in this respect , everything is fine - you raise your child and you love it .
you have a wonderful child and rejoice in it .
you do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible .
&quot; it brings the opportunity to participate in decision-making and child and takes away the anxiety that binds parents , because they are not sure they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
finally , the child decide with which sex is more endorses - and this is a great thing .
it gives children the power to make their own decisions .

karel drabek : uhlířský hill - one of the youngest volcanoes .
uhlířský hill is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of bruntálu .
along with several others is evidence of volcanic activity in the low jeseníku at a time ( in geological terms ) recently .
the last eruption here was still at the beginning of the quaternary .
when viewed from a distance is at the top of the hill uhlířského striking whitewashed baroque pilgrimage church of our lady of succour , built between 1755 - , 1765 .
it replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel .
the inn , which stood next to the church is preserved .
shortly after the completion of the church was planted avenue of four rows of lime trees , about 1 km long .
way of the cross on the hill uhlířský is the third version of the original stood here after 1916 , the second from 2001 lasted only until 2004 .
fifteen stops are wooden sculptures , made by local woodcarver františek nedomlel .
he used different kinds of trees from an area of ​ ​ low jeseníku .
similarly , the base of the rocks from the local areas are interesting geological exposition .
at each stop is given the name of the sponsor .
uhlířský top of the rest of the young volcano .
although the data from radiometric age measurements differ somewhat , the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago .
it is therefore younger than the great roudný ( age 3.3 million years ) and older than venus volcano ( age 0.8 million years ) .
the volcano was born explosion .
when it vomited large amounts of volcanic ash along with rock debris on the ground that burning a red-brown color .
at the end of this phase spilled on the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters thick .
the second eruption ejected red , reddish brown and sometimes almost black tuffs .
their coat is mighty to 50 meters and the area is accessible in the wall of the quarry .
in the tuffs are striking volcanic bombs as large as 1 meter . i second eruption ended with an outpouring of lava .
at the conclusion of the activity of the volcano spilled lava , which now accounts for up to 50 m thick layer of slag basalt .
volcanoes , which alternates with volcanic ash spew lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes .
because they are actually composed of layers was named stratovolcano .
original volcanic cone subject to gradual erosion .
however , the danger to the mining of rocks in a quarry on the south side .
the most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962 .
tuffs were added to the concrete , which was then lighter and have better thermal insulation properties .
the mining is managed under the pressure of professionals and the public to stop and thereby preserve this unique place .
the problem , however , is the lack of consistency and porosity of rocks that quickly erode , disintegrate and sesouvají down the slope .
lom and relatively fast disappearing .
to make matters even more complicated is warm , south-facing slopes ideal for some rare species of plants and animals .
the correction is therefore problematic , but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a distinctive geological profile .
it &apos;s nothing new , similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites .
on top uhlířský you get the green trail from bruntálu , or from the silesian kočová .
motorists may use the free parking at the beginning of the linden alley where it starts and short nature trail .
the drunk poured gasoline throughout the house : he threatened to set fire to it with his own family !

anger over judgment rendered over osnovatel bali blast
survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb attack on bali in 2002 , reacted angrily to the verdict against the last of the plotters , who were brought to justice , and said that umar patek should be executed .
patek , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in southeast asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for that assembled the explosive device that was used in the bombing .
for 15 years he could be paroled .
this 45letý man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of ​ ​ kuta , after which the remaining 202 people dead , including 88 australians , and many wounded .
he was also found guilty on several other counts related to terrorism , including a series of bomb attacks on churches in indonesia on christmas eve 2000 .
the prosecution demanded a life sentence , although they might insist that the man nicknamed &quot; demolition man &quot; ( demolition ) due to its reputation as a specialist in the manufacture of explosives given the death penalty .
this decision again revived painful memories of june corteenové , mother of perth , that the devastating attack is launched on friday and the other plotters almost ten years ago lost their 39letá twins jane and jenny .
with tears in his eyes said that friday should be sentenced to death .
i really think that he should follow in the footsteps of others .
the agency aap mrs. corteenová said : &quot; he should be executed by a firing squad . &quot;
every day i have to live with the fact that you see the other grandchildren and his daughters .
sari club was razed to the ground , he was the 12th october 2002 shortly after 23 hour detonated a powerful bomb placed in a parked van outside .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only about 20 seconds before a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives .
as a result of the explosion fell into a coma for a month , and while he was being kept alive , three doctors &quot; died &quot; .
mr. hughes said that friday should suffer the same fate as the other three members of the ji terrorist cells responsible for the massacre - amroziho , muchlase and imam samudra - who were executed four years ago .
this guy should get the death penalty as one .
keeping him alive ... no reason to keep him alive , just not there .
get 20 years for the 202 people killed and hundreds more injured , not so much .
patek stood before the court as the last of the bali bombers .
arrest avoided almost ten years , but eventually was captured in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where the less than four months later , u.s. forces killed former al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
during the trial , fbi agent said in his testimony that the reports of the intelligence services revealed that patek was in pakistan to meet with bin laden in an effort to re-establish a connection between terrorist groups in southeast asia and al-qaeda .
&quot; he did not give voluntarily , &quot; said mrs. corteenová .
until now felt remorse for how much grief caused to others .
the verdict comes before 10 anniversary of the attack , which will be later this year which will include a ceremony in bali and australia .
&quot; this year we will see a lot of tears , &quot; said mrs. corteenová .
patek still may appeal against the judgment .
francis pope appoints first cardinals in february
the vatican announced thursday that pope francis 22nd february first appointed new cardinals of the catholic church .
the cardinals are in the clergy of the catholic church &apos;s highest position next to the pope and those who elect the pope , so františek appoints its first group of men who ultimately help choose his successor .
it is now 201 cardinals .
however , once the cardinal reached the age of 80 years , who can not participate in the election of the pope - the group is reduced to 120 and opting for the cardinals .
in a statement announcing the report , father federico lombardi , vatican spokesman , said that before the promotion ceremony of the new cardinals will be held assemblies current cardinals known as konzistorium .
&quot; pope francis decided to communicate its decision to convene february konzistorium advance to facilitate planning other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world , &quot; said lombardi .
jack valero of catholic voices sheet said that the number of voters cardinals to february is likely to fall .
he said that the pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary , to the number of electors rose again to 120 , and many cardinals over age 80 years , how much he wants .
konzistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after francis was in march this year elected , valero said .
at this moment shows a certain focus on europe , europe and especially italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new cardinals pope nominates the rest of the world to restore balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of roman catholics in south america , but they have only a small number of cardinals .
it will also be the first choice of the cardinals since francis appointed as the council of cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who had the task of finding ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope decided everything for himself .
&quot; now francis chose these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that the cardinals pope asks for advice .
in this situation , but we were not before - it is absolutely new .
valero said that the popes traditionally lifted up to the position of cardinal bishops of the big points , but frank is &quot; full of surprises - so we do not know who to designate . &quot;

although in august this year celebrated its eightieth birthday , shorter is still full of energy , as evidenced by the fact that prague concert at strings of autumn starts his world tour .
wayne shorter entered the world of music for more than sixty years ago .
the list of artists he has worked with , ranging from miles davis through herbie hancock , joni mitchell to carlos santana .

secret war : syria , libya and iran .
training for obama as the bombing of syria .
u.s. commandos in libya .
top gun in the persian gulf .
israelis showed exactly how to look bombing syria .
without undue hype , threats and millions statement sent planes , you hit the target and returned .
without leaving lulled official elimination of chemical weapons in syria .
the whole event will refuse to acknowledge it and to not express it .
the exact opposite is confused and grandiloquent , actions unsupported obama &apos;s syria policy .
a most satisfactory throughout the attack was what the israelis bombed .
do not be fooled by the media claims that the bombing &quot; syrian base &quot; or &quot; supplies to hezbollah . &quot;
recently , i wrote here that while u.s. aid to the secular insurgents remain in the country only on the rhetorical level , so merrily on russia supplies arms to syria .
a very fresh supply russian rockets landed in the port latákija become the target of the israeli raid .
clear message .
a notice of israel again bombed the assad regime , not the rebels , although it &apos;s popular internet theory should be the opposite .
the u.s. government has distinguished two members spaciálních units , probably delta force .
he did not know until now that distinguished themselves during the attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi .
it is known heroic death of two former members of the seals , who defended the cia campus in the city , i think they were members of a secret cia squads , which is made up of former soldiers .
it has long been speculated they did seals from the consulate or even residence located elsewhere in the cia .
now it &apos;s clearer .
anyway , the information that the cia has its offices in libya protected machine-gun nests ( just one that both members of the seals killed after being hit mortar ) is quite surprising .
but even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes .
they were part of the u.s. commandos in tripoli , and soon received word of the attack in benghazi volunteered to intervention and , together with five private contractors a way into the cia campus in benghazi .
obama administration disgrace the fact that during that attack , it was not officially squad deployed a whole , and that is simply reluctant to do .
commander commando and apparently without orders release these volunteers .
anyway , that operates in a country not once , but constantly american commandos , cia agents and private contractors is quite interesting information .
and due to the fact that until recently no such thing officially denied it even now talks about some sort of counseling nato mission in libya .
but it is good that the usa even if half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in libya .
although the national situation to resolve it wanted to help much more .
the last secret place a permanent conflict , which today i want to write the coast of iran .
not so long ago , the media almost spoke of the iranian air force for prosecution of u.s. drones .
little is known , however , how the americans effectively protect their drones .
of course , if you happen to manage to discover its drone airspace , not to do anything with it .
however , if the iranians discovered drone in the international area , the situation is quite different .
and so it was that the iranian aircraft f-4 phantom chased american drone in international space above the sea , which was perhaps the first deployment of american super sharp fighter f-22 raptor in history .
the phantom podletěl to visually verify the equipment without being registered on the radar phantom or you just noticed and then he suddenly appeared to him and urged iranian pilot to return home , he obeyed without a murmur .
no wonder , when the airplane phantom of american manufacturing , but remember the war in vietnam .
the raptor can compare .
the court blocked the regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching people police department in ny
a federal appeals court on thursday blocked a court order requiring changes in the stopping and searching of persons to the police department in new york and the judge dismissed the case .
the other u.s. federal appeal court said that the decision of judge shira scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on the appeal filed by the city .
the judge decided in august that the city violated the constitution so that their program stopping and questioning people .
city its conclusions and its provision of thought , including the decision to allocate supervision , which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training program with them .
the court of appeal heard arguments on tuesday for the requested postponement .
the court of appeal said that the judge must be off the case because he came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges , and that a judge did not act as required to avoid the appearance of bias , partly due to a series of interviews with the media and public declaration , which openly responded to criticism of the court .
the judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly focused on blacks and hispanics as part of its program to stop and search people .
appointed independent supervision to oversee major reforms , including changes in procedures , training and supervision , and ordered to launch a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in certain areas where there is the most frequent stopping people .
in august , the city of new york approved the termination of the storage method names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after police scan .
oral grounds for appeal , the city is scheduled sometime after 14 march 2014 .
tactics stopping and searching of persons criticized a number of defenders of civil rights .
have some form of stop and search people for about for decades , but recorded examinations administered by an independent mayor michael bloomberg has dramatically increased to a record 684,330 in 2011 , in most cases , were blacks and hispanics .
in 2004 , wrote four men , who all belong to the minority action , which is still the case a class action .
proponents of changes to the program stopping and searching of persons by police departments in ny is that changes terminates unfair practices will enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures use different police departments .
opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police , but no crime , and that it wasted money , but it will not solve the larger problem is that a police force under pressure after the last decade to reduce its numbers by several thousand people .
the judge noted that ended the practice of stopping and searching of persons , which is constitutional , but has reformed the way the police department tours in ny introduced .
center cdc issued a directive to schools regarding allergies in children
on wednesday , the center for disease control ( cdc ) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of children &apos;s food allergies at school .
this is the first set of such directives issued by the u.s. government , due to the fact that the number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies on the rise .
one of 20 children in the united states has a food allergy .
center cdc found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 percent .
the guidelines include information for schools on how faculty and staff informed about children &apos;s food allergies and how an allergic reaction , if it occurs , to respond .
it also encourages schools to have adrenalin - the most commonly used brand epipen auto injector - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity .
state legislators recently updated their rules to allow schools to store adrenalin easily .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction .
the child may say , &quot; it &apos;s like someone poking your tongue , &quot; &quot; i feel that i have hair on my tongue &quot; or &quot; language itches me . &quot;
tipsport how ( not ) deleted personal information .
over a year ago , i registered the site tipsport.cz .
then i followed but did not finish because it was sitting on a branch someone from the internet registration could not be completed .
and because i did not want to go to another branch registration failed , then i moved and because i changed address and identity card number .
when i wanted to complete the registration later , i was told that it is impossible because i have another op number , address , and it just is not complete and that i should ask for the deletion of data and re-registration .
so i did , and october 24 , 2013 , i wrote to tech support to ask for the deletion of their personal data from the database according to the law on protection of personal data .
on that day she wrote me a rainbow technical support that i have to complete the registration at any branch .
thus began a marathon e-mail technical support , where finally the fourth urganci 25.10. wrote that personal information deleted at my request .
one could therefore say that could make one new registration and here again the problems began soon i wrote that my username is already taken ( i understand it was not deleted - it is not personal information , but in the end i knocked this ) .
so i used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal information already stored , to finish the registration at the branch ( as may have saved something claiming to erase ? ) , so i contacted tech support again .
my question is how can i write back to that personal data is actually deleted 25.10. and i sent an e-mail with that error .
that &apos;s what i did ( yesterday around the 15th hour ) and write back to me today that i have registered the same day ( 31 october 2013 ) at 13.22 , and that therefore it is impossible because i used the same name and date of birth .
what does it matter that i contact technical support for a week already and i deal with them , it still does not work .
and what about the fact that if it were true assertions ( as is ) could not register one with the same name or same date of birth if this is already registered .
just by the way , those 13.22 i actually registered to the same name and date of birth , but i used a fictional e-mail and telephone number and lo and behold , there was my page that my e-mail was sent a link to complete registration .
but how is this possible when you can not register the same name and date of birth ?
probably because tipsport binds to the registration e-mail and phone number and data simply has not surrendered as he claims .
so i again told the technical support that simply lying ( either intentionally or not know what to write ) , because what they write is not true .
substantiate some screenshots i think the problem with the registration had been before 31.10. so &quot; fake &quot; registration for this is simply not relevant .
on it i wrote tipsport curt sentence - i &apos;m sorry , but that you &apos;ve re-registered , we can investigate your claim .
a communication ended .
or repeats the same phrase over and over , that binds to the registration name and date of birth .
they can not accept the fact that registration has not been completed , click on that link in the e-mail and so not really taken place .
to sum up , tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims , but even lying when he says the opposite .
o &apos;s worse is that it can easily prove to lie and try to make it appear that the error is on the client side .
anyway , after putting the issue on my personal blog to give things a bit in motion and technical support e-mail came that the matter be transmitted to verification and will be informed ( after a week of haggling and reminders and warnings to make the same mistake ) .
killing us sorry , but we are innocent , defends the leaders of the khmer rouge
nuon chea was number two in the hierarchy of the khmer rouge leaders khieu samphan and the former head of state .

the fact is that i did not have any power , &quot; he added .
nuon chea said that never ordered khmer rouge cadres to &quot; the people mistreated or killed to denying them food or commit genocide . &quot;
but admitted &quot; moral responsibility &quot; for the dead .
&quot; i would like to sincerely apologize to the public , victims , their families , all the cambodian people , &quot; he said .
fifties bin sivle that for the khmer rouge came about eleven relatives , afp said she could not excuse nuon chea accept . &quot;
&quot; you lied to us . &quot;
&quot; i just wanted to be acquitted . &quot;
&quot; he does not care about others , &quot; she said .
&quot; if they did not issue orders to his subordinates would not kill , &quot; he said , adding that the leaders of the khmer rouge are &quot; worse than monsters . &quot;
before the court should face also &quot; foreign minister &quot; of the khmer rouge regime ieng sary , who died in march this year .
his wife , ieng thirith , former minister of social affairs , in september 2012 the court found incompetent due to dementia process .

british businessman made ​ ​ the first ice cream that glows in the dark - using jellyfish .
charlie francis used the fluorescence properties of marine animal and developed a fluorescent treat .
the idea came when he read scientific essay on jellyfish , and convinced scientists in china to chemically produced a protein that causes fluorescence .
this ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer - increases the ph level in the protein and subsequently causes the radiation .
chris says that ice is lit when it reacts with the heat of your mouth , so the more the league , the more of september .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; ( lick me , taste great ) , says : &quot; it &apos;s an amazing substance , but in terms of production , we are at the beginning , so for 200 gbp will get about 2 g of the substance . &quot;
the protein , which we use in ice cream , reacts with your tongue at neutral ph .
so how hot your mouth protein , increases the ph level and the ice begins to shine .
we tested it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for a halloween celebration , because it causes this fantastic glowing effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i &apos;ve ever made ​ ​ , because jellyfish fluorescence is four times more expensive than gold .
so me each scoop is about 140 gbp .
but it tastes great .
charlie experimental company based in bristol is known for its innovative flavors beer , cheese , beef and leaves of gold .
his next product to be but still ambitious .
he says : &quot; i really wanted to make an invisible ice cream . &quot;
in essence , it is impossible due to refraction of light caused by ice crystals that form ice , but i reckon with the fact that for some way to do it , find it .
ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish , artificially produced by chinese scientists .

martin doktor of the problems with the olympics in sochi : communication with the russians is a challenging
the corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile and then took a deep sigh : &quot; it &apos;s challenging . &quot;
cooperation with the organizing team of the olympics in sochi 2014 &apos;s by dr. martina little more complicated .
on what was the last olympics , we forget .
&quot; nothing works as well , &quot; says the head of czech olympic mission .
what exactly is happening ?
many things work more slowly and less accurately .
it &apos;s kind of confusing .
in terms of the invoices are relatively fast , in terms of supplying information on the essential things already that much .
maybe one for three months paci , to provide us with as they will officially designated individual villages to whichever could do all sorts of things .
we &apos;re still waiting and they still say that the thing they communicate .
in many ways , still communicate .
it had at least completed the olympic village ?
but it &apos;s not catastrophic condition .
a month ago we went through the empty rooms .
houses fortunately stands .
what does that are empty ?
they need the finished floor ?
just a basic concrete , thus such was the state of a month ago .
but they still have time .
although there is a danger that up there on the 26th january vanguard arrive , there will still smell the glue .
and if he could not keep up , will you ?
president putin would think there herded army ?
that &apos;s how it goes about .
just that it was not the olympic village = potemkin village .
rather threatens to miss the adjustment of routes for example , nedodělají details .
maybe they will have a path in such a state that we have to take with you boots from the london games .
but i believe it had something to give the cluster .
how many czech athletes could go to sochi ?
now , there are about 78 , although depending on the nomination criteria is that the number varies .
maybe skaters probably will go in the trio , who went for a drive .
about rychlobruslařce martin sáblíková also one need not doubt , but otherwise it is in development .
still waiting for you journey to sochi ?
no , unless nothing happens , i should go there to 26 january .
how will they look like houses in the olympic village , we know .
even we ourselves have some things measured the subway , we could not believe just sketches .
we are also preparing a number of other things , including transport .
and what does the head of the mission one hundred days before the olympics ?
preparing the annual evaluation of individual olympic sports plus doing routine work in terms of communication with the organizing committee in sochi .
place tenderloin election election goulash
october elections rather than winner brought a bunch of losers .
it &apos;s not just the parties engaged in the chamber of deputies or not received ( eg spoz ) , but also the previous government parties ( ods , top 09 ) and finally the social democrats because of their internal schism .
politicians us instead of beef served a festive weekend election stew .
jumper of elections became the movement andrej babis , who promised voters to change the existing political style of governance .
fragmentation of the election results , and the split in the winning side of the political records ( z ) the will of president milos zeman , regardless of the wishes of voters which party they zeman president publicly supported or not chosen in the house of commons .
while the president has lost because of unpleasant events strategic edge over other policies , but left him a few more ways to get it back - for example , selecting a future prime minister .
while the social democrats , the chances of getting the prime minister in my eyes recede , entrepreneur andrej babis closer to the contrary .
post-election developments , although still far removed from the smooth and speedy formation of a stable government , but compared to the pre-election scenario leftist social democrats supported the communist government is the development of business in the czech republic and thus the economy was better news .
due to vocal opposition yes to get together with ods and top 09 is still the most likely alternative coalition social democrats , yes and kdu-csl ( a total of 111 deputies ) .
due to the split in the social democrats , who thus became unreadable and weak parterre at negotiations may be the result of coalition negotiations daunting enough for the party .
the minority government consisting of the social democrats &apos; nezemanovců &quot; at the castle probably will not pass .
in addition , any government , to which the cssd will participate , will be compromised unmet ambitions of many social democrats , which may lead sooner or later to a further split in the party .
i ask myself , &quot; nespějeme gravity to other early elections ? &quot;
another option would have been rather a referendum on the strength of voter mandate yes movement .
cssd plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes , a stronger increase in income taxes or state bank building fell under the table hopefully .
pages cssd , yes , kdu-csl and the dawn on the other hand the same example to support entrepreneurship , moderate fiscal policy ( government deficit below 3 % of gdp ) to promote employment for disadvantaged people , reduce the lower rate of vat on selected goods .
friction surfaces are most frequently found in the perspective of social policy and the size of the state .
yes has the upper hand now , but so far the most likely coalition program yes , cssd , kdu-csl would be leaning more to the right .
which in my view is ultimately better than left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving .
until recently it seemed that the majority of citizens in the czech republic wished to early elections .
the reasons were cited corruption , squandering money on overpriced purchases and government contracts , tax increases and , last but not least , government scandals .
according to the election results it can be concluded that a majority of the state meet .
that they actually did not mind and the condition that there was ( theft of a debt of the state ) , were actually satisfied .
otherwise i can not explain that 3,413,497 voters failed to vote , 596,357 voters voted top 09,384,174 ods voters elected a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original ruling coalition , which represents 52.16 % of the rightful voters .
which is a majority .
when the above parties i add 1,016,829 voters cssd , then the old order ( because all these parties participated in the &quot; looting &quot; a debt of the state ) , then this condition actually agreed rightful 64.23 % of voters .
this fact , the majority of voters made ​ ​ it clear that they are not to punish the guilty looting and over-indebtedness of the state .
or maybe you think that the members of the social democrats , who was involved planting of appropriate laws ?
we even help ?

scientists more light on how the tail movements related to the dog &apos;s mood
earlier research has shown that joyful dogs wagging tail to the right ( from the perspective of the dog ) , while nervous dogs tail waving mostly to the left .
but now scientists say that other dogs can detect these subtle differences in the movement of the tail to record a response .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neurobiologist at the university of trento , said : &quot; with men it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different binding to the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions . &quot;
the same thing we tried to be observed in other species .
he added that , as is the case in humans and dogs the right side of the brain responsible for the left-hand movements and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions .
in order to get more information about how dogs respond to asymmetrical tail wagging of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals watched movies about other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior .
probably will not be long before you understand why sometimes goes their tail to one side , and sometimes on the other .
professor vallortigara said , &quot; we projected dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version , or in the form of silhouettes - to get rid of any confounding stimuli , and we are also able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate it more to the right or left . &quot;
when the animals saw otherwise lackluster dog move his tail to the right ( from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail ) remained completely calm .
but when he saw the shooting tail largely left ( again from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail ) , their heart rate increased and the animals she was unsure .
professor vallortigara said he does not think that dogs through these movements consciously communicate with each other .
rather , it believes that the dogs have learned from experience , that the movement must and you need not to pay attention .
he said : &quot; if you meet several dogs and move their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior , you respond to this experience . &quot;
researchers say the findings may dog owners , veterinarians and cvičitelům help better understand the emotions of their animals .
an expert on dog behavior john bradshaw , a high school teacher veterinary medicine at the university of bristol , said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side for dogs is important .
last year a team from the university of lincoln found that dogs turned away his head to the left when watching an aggressive dog , and right when looking at the cheerful dog .
a specialist in another paper by the university of victoria in canada said : &quot; the dog robot dogs are more likely to be acquainted when the tail wagging the left than the right , which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite compared to the italian study . &quot;
the difference may be due to him that the dogs in the different studies animals in movies or dog robots landings quite like dogs .
he explained that it could help the study of how dogs react to real dogs .
&quot; although in the case of many different mammals , there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
but given how easy it is to record their behavior , probably will not be long before you understand why sometimes their tail goes one way and sometimes the other .
rbs suspended two traders in foreign currency
according to two people familiar with the situation suspended royal bank of scotland ( rbs ) two businessmen in their division with a foreign currency , which is another indication that global investigation enforcement authorities regarding shady currency market is becoming more common .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs confirmed that cooperate with the competent authorities in the investigation of the largest financial market in the world where every day changing hands 5.3 trillion usd .
the two traders were the first by rbs employees suspended in the context of an expanding investigation , which is a response to the scandal of manipulating libor ( london interbank rate ) .
the bank refused to comment on the suspension , but confirmed that this month received from the authorities of the request for information .
&quot; our relentless quest in this matter continues and we fully co-operate with the fca and our other authorities , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , people who are close to the event , said that rbs gave the british the financial behavior records e-mails and instant messages sent from accounts and the accounts of a former trader .
the businessman richard usher , left rbs in 2010 and assumed that he was released from his current position of the president of the european foreign exchange trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , president of the european trading for cash at citi , took vacation this week , while matt gardiner , a former head of currency trades in barclays and ubs , was suspended this week by standard chartered .
neither of these dealers were charged with any offense .
the group mr. usher instant messaging were bankers from barclays and citigroup , said people dedication to this event .
the bank ubs this week stated that after the swiss supervisory authority finma announced that it was investigating suspicious machinations of the market with foreign currency in several swiss banks , has taken action against any of its employees .
worldwide , at least six agencies - the european commission , finma , the swiss antitrust authority weko , fca , ministry of justice and the u.s. monetary authorities in hong kong - examines the claim that these bankers conspired to moving around a lot with the currency market .
people familiar with the situation said that hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse has launched an internal investigation , or from the competent authority has received a request for information .
banks are combing years old instant messaging and e-mails to find it in case of violations .
investigation reports alarmed traders in the region , which was one of the biggest engine for making profits in the investment bank closings in recent years , but that was disrupted by a small volatility of currencies limited the opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they claimed that the large and highly liquid market for foreign currency is virtually impossible to manipulate , but senior marketers say that this is not necessarily true .
a senior trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign exchange trading dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing use their own internal platforms means that &quot; you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices . &quot;
the news came on the same day the company credit suisse announced the release this week of his department for equities trader who late last year caused a loss of nearly 6 million usd .
the bank immediately drew the attention of the relevant authorities and cooperating with the regulatory authorities .
&quot; we believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved , &quot; the company said credit suisse .
negotiated by the government with klaus and spidla .
now csl jan kasal sent to babis .
the christian democrats won a fourteen mps , therefore , only a third of the social democrats or representatives yes .
in the negotiations on the government but enter at least one advantage .
the team , which already began to argue outlines possible coalition to jan kasal - the man who tuned people &apos;s party government participation conditions in the years 1992 , 1996 , 2002 and 2006 .
social democrats and andrej babis like a matador on their side do not .
it &apos;s probably time to commemorate the first negotiations in 1992 , when ods was also a completely new page .
&quot; the experience had been minimal , &quot; estimates kasal , how will this year &apos;s talks develop .

prospal : i want a contract in the nhl .
condition , lust and passion still have
pro asleep was always the first family , because she wants in his 38 years of full submission .
either he gets a job overseas and still get extended career or playing hockey finally over .
&quot; i want to play the role of dad and husband . &quot;
&quot; i look forward to it , &quot; says hockey player who still vainly waiting for an offer .
despite the fact that it is a renowned workhorse who never neosid .
despite being on the ice every heart and can let it tear down and teammates .
and despite the fact that last season was the most productive player in columbus .
&quot; but the desire to show everyone he &apos;s still in me , &quot; reports the determination .
maybe we will see , it is supposedly the new york rangers , who failed to enter into the season and they have injured two pillars - the attackers rick nash and ryan callahan .
how did you came to the rangers look like ?
it &apos;s just speculation .
until i have something on paper , so it is not worth to deal with .
i know that there was an article in the new york post , that i should sign , but that &apos;s all .
it was never delivered , that this really happened .
unfortunately , myself , would like to announce that i have a contract , but it just is not so .
do not you heard nothing from the club ?
such communication takes place every day in the nhl .
there goes about getting into a situation where the contract really matter .
when a player to be injured or to someone not a mančaft struggling .
there are many different factors that must meet together to get the contract .
but in new york , just like circumstances occur , right ?
injury is rick nash and ryan callahan and the team came out entry into the season , so there is some chance , do not you think ?
of course , the chance is always .
the second thing is that we always need two sides .
i would today take a lot of offers , but so far i did not get one .
this is unfortunately the reality in which we live .
on friday i &apos;m off to america , you &apos;re in the expectation that something can all work out after all ?
i have the expectation from the 5th july , when the market opened in nhl free agency , and still nothing .
going to new york to be reminded ?
certainly not , i &apos;m going to tampa for the kids and wife .
i look forward to the sun and on until we meet again .
do you have any pending your program ?
this is due to the fact that i &apos;m a father and husband , and from that everything unfolds .
there are currently no hockey player - i do not have a contract and do not play matches .
so i &apos;ll play the role of dad and husband and i are very much looking forward to it .
already on sunday has vašík two hockey games , it &apos;s for me and my whole family holiday when we go to support our children in what they want to do .
thinking that you could do this in quotes full-time ?
sure , one can think about a lot of things .
and this can occur .
i &apos;ve tried it three years ago when i missed 50 matches due to knee surgery .
a really , really liked me .
once it gets to such a stage that all the goals , wins and passes you replace what you have at home .
as the family and children , it is the meaning of life .
whether you work , what you want .
i had a job that was the most beautiful thing to me except my family could meet .
you had plenty of offers from europe : you have it , you want to play nhl just because it &apos;s nhl or is it because of the family you want to be in america ?
since i &apos;m a hockey player , so the first place - in addition to the family - includes sporting success .
nhl is the best competition in the world .
and since it also affects family life .
my children , then pardon our children - mine and my wife &apos;s - grew up in the states , there began to go to school and so on .
and we would be very happy if in this trend continued .
because what do we delude ourselves in america are opportunities somewhere else .
such a chance would they have to offer .
so you are planning to stay in america permanently ?
we do as we practice now .
this means that in the summer we will be in bohemia deep and around czech budejovice .
and in winter in tampa or wherever they lead our steps .
this is not ideal , are still warm .
i &apos;ve had great luck in life .
you could say that i went in front of him , it took a lot of strength and sacrifice and took me a lot of things that i missed .
but hockey gave me a lot of choices offered and this is one of them .
that she is a woman we can choose where we live .
there are a lot of people who yearn after this , so that they can choose what they do and how they live .
how long each will have at his age will work hard to train hard and wait for an offer ?
yeah , that &apos;s a question you can not answer .
today , i still got inside , the juice , the lust , the enthusiasm , the passion for the sport . the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the nhl , i &apos;m still better than anyone else .
but i can not tell you how long it will remain there still .
you can not plan .
so we can say that this season will wait how it work out and then decide what to do next ?
i &apos;m at the stage where i go every day .
distant planets , black and white movies or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are topics that should an american jazz saxophonist wayne shorter pitched carelessly .

true leadership to stand up for the editors .
the described cases , however , do not answer the question of where such affection of some journalists to zemanovcům takes - whether it is a response to a direct order , or not to use vulgarism , a typical manifestation of abusive empathic responsiveness .
and while we expect the general rottenness can not forgive the question of whether a change of circumstances on tv do not seek other , equally unscrupulous power interests , which have not yet had a chance .
the truth is those who say that in developed countries to okatým attempted intervention of politicians to not broadcast .
the truth , however , is also that it does not mean that there complaints about public media did not exist .
complainants do not question their independence .
on the contrary , mainly to criticize what they consider slant , which they own , which is the fruit of their subculture .
maybe we are just in the stage of civilization have not yet come , and this situation is not with us .
maybe but in a country that thinks himself the most corrupt in the world , black and white stories about evil politicians and journalists spend a good comfortable than complicated descriptions confusing situation in which collide behavior of many imperfect human beings .

in this letter , mr. snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could convince the u.s. government to withdraw criminal charges filed against him .
accusations by the ministry of justice of the united states include espionage and theft of state property .
hans-peter friedrich , germany &apos;s interior minister , told the magazine zeit online : &quot; if mr. snowden ready to talk with german officials find a way to make it possible . &quot;
tensions between the u.s. and germany began to rise , though there have been claims that the nsa wiretapped telephone chancellor angela merkel .

mr snowden said in his letter that he faced harsh and relentless campaign-related persecution , which forced him to leave home .

i hate to nezalknul
the writer václav kahuda after twelve years back to writing .
after many years , when read , lived , but did not write , gives vÁclav kahuda ( 1965 ) new novel wind , dark presence .
that will not be a slender volume , indicates the number of pages comparable to his best-known work thickets ( petrov , 2001 ) .
pro salon kahuda interviewed another significant czech writer today - emil hakl .
what moved where you &apos;re twelve years of silence , wrote a novel ?
i did it - i hate to nezalknul .
see around me always new and new clones of the human pettiness foolish , young people organisms blind selfish endeavor .
about us older not to mention , faces ruined helpless lust vekslácké soul and reverse polarity reversal ideologues who are trying to look young whore to sell their &quot; product &quot; .
at the beginning of the millennium , i bought a small digital camera and filmed his jurodivé friends , weirdos and hidden units .
i &apos;m getting over it .
sometimes i feel like my life on this planet is burning brain .
i prefer to go for a walk and then a night lamp for reading books .
you talk about frustration , hatred .
he was somewhere in the past a turning point that influenced you , or maybe just getting old , as we all ?
the turning point came a long time ago , in about ten years .
at that time it did not name .
well , after that i lived .
somewhere inside is surprised but still quiet boy .
i see another lone cvikýře , each in its tornado anxiety .
it saved me writing books .
i am participating in this gigantic , thousands of years of the movement of life on this planet - the birth of the future elusive .
that vast , breathtaking complexity of life , where every stone is the direct heir of the present .
we &apos;re players sad and beautiful games ever through trial-and-error arises more and more generations of beings that trillions of interactions per second creates a superhuman artificial intelligence .
twelve years is a relatively long time .
do you see your writing as an ongoing process , or did you start from scratch ?
monologue , or rather a dialogue that leads right and left half of the brain , sometimes putting to the surface and forms in the book .
as the era of peace interwoven quietly sleeping metastases wars that might wake up one day - so the book has twelve years of silence dressed in words .
i felt my silent avalanche life growing in the brain , and if you do nothing , so one day i quietly caving .
it &apos;s a set of questions formulated by the brain and is considered layers that are deposited in the dark &quot; below the surface of consciousness . &quot;
the neocortex , gray cortex , asks the older evolutionary units , it is an ancient grain in the brain tree .
he speaks to srstnatým beasts , snakes asks , looking for the answer in the flight of birds , raised his eyes to the clouds in the sky .
yes , the moral law within me , the starry sky above me .
finally , the brain asks world .
relatively often express it metaphorically to the ego - could you define it biologically ?
the brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all the memories , experiences and experiences that the person has lived .
this forest logically and emotionally exposed to a branching tree of information registers memory used by the brain in its recognition , cognitive , process , being exposed to ever-changing presence in the continuous effort in trying to identify and understand their surroundings and decode important messages .
sometimes faults occur from overload .
analogy - as if they &quot; fell &quot; pc , from the vocal emulator and interpreter of foreign languages ​ ​ would you initially entangled in the operating environment such as windows , and after several unsuccessful restarts finished with dark green flickering screen bios , the base system , which controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard between the cpu and ram , etc .
for those who still did not understand what they are talking - talking about spiritual crisis .
you refer to it often - why does not this type of regression regularly cares ?
because it is a pit .
in hitherto functional mechanisms of our thinking , feeling and behavior - appears gap .
here is a good quote from nietzsche : &quot; as long staring into the abyss , the abyss looked up to him . &quot;
pure feeling - that man is lost when all hope disappears , mentally &quot; dies &quot; and started a new quality .
and why do i care personally ?
answer with a parable .
once one fell into a pool and drowning , running days , months and years , he still drowning while reading , and the books had taught him to swim - that is to live .
he became a &quot; diver &quot; .
perhaps someone will help me a written sentence , as once helped me hrabal &apos;s texts .
to what extent do you think the reader to a specific person who will read your text ?
one of which is not to say anything meaningful , some call it consciousness , another super ego , but i believe it best to characterize arthur rimbaud in a letter to a friend :
&quot; i is someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences . &quot;
from an early age he read books of old czech fairy tales , sailed in a submarine of captain nemo , stínadlech running around in dark alleys .
just then , behind this branching authors and their message is : &quot; the sun clear of other worlds karel hynek macha . &quot;
and when the book is out there ?
it depends on the reader &apos;s opinion ?
the repercussions that to you through the people who read the book , get it ?
of course i care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns , and are willing to read five hundred pages of text .
and then me , even after years on the street randomly contacted and thank me that i had his book helped them in some difficult life decisions .
books are actually &quot; lives &quot; or rather &quot; worlds &quot; .
they are encoded in the character letters carry the experience , the history of the region that language .
whenever we wake up to a life sentence if we let them flow to the brain .
it is actually , in a way , something forbidden divine - waking up more and more stories of life , the universe and temporary small planet .
it &apos;s a fact whose dna is stored in lines - according to the old books démonologických to commit witchcraft .
after the publication of the book you - as usual - waiting chain readings .
i remember reading once that you like .
vrhneš into it again with joy , or do you feel after years otherwise ?
today , rather just tell .
and when i found out it ?
wherever they live good intelligent people .
their basic character - are stealthy , too does not purport to themselves , have a friendly radiation , do not feel lonely with them .
i &apos;ll give an example - in the town of red kostelec lived was ( and i hope he &apos;s still alive ) one curly bookseller ( called aptly robin ) , a cheerful companion and good girls bull .
when one pijatyce introduced me to different links in the chain of readers of my book thicket .
i looked them in the eye and then i was shown the ragged , octene copy of my book .
embarrassed , i just put the reading position sausage and shortly masculine wept .
silently , we all stood there , swaying drunkenly and wept with emotion .
then to the young blond mongrel did not last as the roar jumped headfirst out the window at the snow drifts .
it was on the ground floor .
we ran into the night landscape and jati happy rabies citlivců , aching and longing soul compatriot forgotten patriots - howling and braying as werewolves until dawn .
each book is yours formally and substantively different than the previous ones .
this also applies to text , wind , darkness , presence ?
it &apos;s a story .
it is the tale of one country for nine rivers and the nine mountains .
ivan bunin in her novel suchodol inserted into the mouth of folk healers words of an old russian fable : at sea , the ocean , the island bujāne .
female dog lies on her gray chest .
horror , horror , mystery .
it never happened , but all of it from somewhere .
maybe once upon a time we were devils in hell , and cast lots - role on this earth we play .
are you going to continue to write , or just let it again on the high tide of inspiration ?
responses are eternal - mark twain .
writing is a marvelous way dialogue .
something huge and nameless , like the movement of continents on the planet affects our volition of such depth and breadth such that it completely beyond our horizon - and as a matter of course we do exactly in line with its programmed task .
we are rewarded influx of dopamine , a mixture of endorphins and other substances .
we are biological machines .
we want to mate , and die in defense of the acquisition of new passenger territories .
sometimes failure and radiate compassion .
only when we have the right to call themselves human beings .
this is the answer to your question - biological robot is already filled with various disorders , stands on the shore of the ocean of the unconscious and leaky sails made ​ ​ from a dirty handkerchief catches tides vlahého wind .
i have to write , i could be a man .
schools should focus more on math , spelling and grammar
during hours of english literature will be necessary to study at least one shakespeare play , 19th amendment century romantic poetry and contemporary british fiction from 1914 onwards .
the test will also include &quot; hidden text &quot; in order to motivate a deeper reading ;
combined courses in english literature and language will be deleted .
since 2015 , the students are required to have a school-leaving examination in the language , and will be encouraged to choose english literature as optional subject .
the ministry of education should tomorrow release new curriculum for english and mathematics - the first objects to undergo radical change .
for other essential items , changes await next year .
in a separate step ofqual office , which oversees the school-leaving examination reveals changes in the structure of school-leaving examination , together with the new system of marking a smaller volume projects for students .
in his speech in the summer of education secretary michael gove said that there is &quot; broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our examination system in order to regain the trust of society , &quot; and that it is necessary to insist that the examination could be &quot; challenging more ambitious and stringent . &quot;
the study shows that english schools devote less time mathematics - 116 hours per year or three hours a week - than most other countries .
for comparison schools in australia dedicated to math average of 143 hours per year and about 138 in singapore
although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics , coalition sources said that comprehensive school-leaving exam in mathematics - along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results charts - likely to encourage schools to provide extra tuition .
the curriculum will focus more on &quot; the problems of the real world , &quot; including financial mathematics .
ostrava mayor kajnar cancer in the cssd is not me
before the election was fully ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the ostrava cssd .
all this culminated when the mayor of ostrava petr kajnar go to court because of the undemocratic assembly candidates .
actors cases to it still did not want to speak too , that the parties before the elections even more damage .
now they are the voices of voters numbered .
keeping in ostrava and the social democrats on monday evening called on the mayor of ostrava to secede from the side , and will probably push on it to come on their function .
petr kajnar but wants to keep fighting .
what goes in disputes and who is on whose side , described in an exclusive interview with the journal .
how do you feel about the outcome of elections ?
cssd certainly allowed for a much better result .
harm her with us to the address before the elections in the media disputes within the party ?
i imagine that social democracy could have a better election result .
but on the other hand , it corresponds to the state in which the cssd is now .
it is a party which has its own internal problems , is intrinsically ill and people perceive that it is not all right .
in the elections to make it clear .
what are the internal medicine cssd ?
decline for some time passes me by ods and things like that now , unfortunately taking place in social democracy .
is it that lobbyists influential people who previously had expected that their benefices find at ods , moved to the people in the cssd and have an impact .
it is related to the fact that the offices of the municipality of ostrava police come and collect your computer .
it shows that the cssd is not made up only of people who would like the benefit of others , but many of them are thinking of the good of his own .
cssd is divided into two irreconcilable camps and prague , as seen in the current power struggle between haskovec and sobotkovci .
i have to be prepared but long .
that &apos;s what happened before the elections in ostrava , was a harbinger of what is happening now in prague .
hašek wing gradually occupied a position to then after the election could cause a situation that weakens sobotka wing .
people in politics in a situation where sometimes have to compromise .
everyone has an inner boundary but when it compromises you do not go , and that &apos;s my case .
originally i did not want to stand in the house , but when i perceived the whole thing within the party , so i made ​ ​ a deal with lubos zaorálek i &apos;ll try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen as mayor of ostrava sobotka right wing .
hašek wing but it could stop .
why stand on the side of bohuslav sobotka , not michal hasek ?
mussels sobotka to me is a man who always speaks primarily about the cssd and to some extent for the vision for the party and for the country .
i admit that the other side heard anything like that .
michal hašek just fighting for power .
i do not understand how the bureau , which is lower than the central authority of the executive committee , just start undoing the party chairman .
it is a struggle for power no matter what , and against the statutes party .
i think what we now michal hašek performed in prague , he ended his political career .
how did you perceive that you ostrava cssd leadership to the candidate did not approve .
political parties are based on the competition , who are both members of their places .
the competition should be largely based on program vision and the ability of the people to fulfill the vision .
of course , however , this voice of the people who power or ability to have a vision , but the party is for them a lift to the money you would get elsewhere .
the problem is when these people start to the fore because unscrupulous infringers violate the statutes of the party .
their practices make the political parties and the mafia by me and also violate the laws of the czech republic .
alert on this issue is more important to me than to take account of whether a kajnar has a political future .
it is important that the parties began to respect the statutes .
therefore , you are then brought before the election proposal to the court for an injunction against the form of the ballot cssd in the moravian-silesian region ?
the current county executive committee cssd in ostrava consolidate his power by organizations that do not fit , he can cancel the new purpose-based organization , gradually throws party members uncomfortable .
example of this is the fact that they wanted to exclude richard bednarik of the club representatives , but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then resolution to exclude rather canceled .
this shows that claim adherence to the parties before the court , although the last option , but when the other methods and control bodies within the cssd stopped working , it &apos;s the only option .
the management of the ostrava social democrats , headed by deputy adam rykala is revoked you from the position of mayor .
it is an open secret that this post has a crush mayor poruby lumír palyza .
that &apos;s right , adam rykala and lumír palyza trying to do everything so that i could appeal .
they promise to rank people , get votes and then the voices strengthen their power in the party .
when you return to the past and everything that happened to be around the football club banik ostrava stadium and purchase bazaly was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me .
it was artificially staged to me could be described as a person who gives money where it does not belong .
in doing so , the city bought the property to him strategically a great value .
how do you see it move on with their remaining as mayor ?
the district committee had me and another on monday urged people to consider whether to remain in the cssd .
but i think that it &apos;s as if the thief shouting : to catch a thief !
looking at the results of my work for the last eleven years , so i do not see anyone in ostrava social democracy , who initiated and enforced , sometimes against party members , the emergence of so many developing things like industrial zones or expansion of scientific-technological park .
despite all this i become uncomfortable .
i do not read it differently than that you interfere with others , came to the place they desire .
we will therefore these efforts still somehow fight ?
since when has this republic to function well , it must work well on political parties .
i can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state , he can not drive or herself .
i do not speculate , therefore , that i now retired from the social democrats , because i think that whoever causes cancer this side , not me , but these people who are trying to vyštvat me .
we want to show that the city can still win , promises rajtoral
it &apos;s a bit of a paradox .
while his team is primarily profit lately fail , defender or midfielder viktoria plzen františek rajtoral the form that earned him after a return to the national team .
he &apos;s doing well shooting , and bursting with activity after surgery it was in the game in teplice ordered a penalty kick .
viktoria reached in the last two rounds against slavia prague and teplice to win , but at the end of the two duels took a single point .
františek rajtoral believes his team in the game against jablonec unpleasant series of breaks .
we want to show that we can win .
&quot; i believe that jablonec home defeat , &quot; promises františek rajtoral .
crew is difficult to match the severočechy who play attacking football , carefully prepared .
everything points to the game against jablonec coach prepared us well , as always , we draw a lot from videorozboru game opponent .
&quot; i believe that on friday evening will be a great match , &quot; czech representative attracts fans to the stands doosan arena .
pilsen last matches did not work out the way she wanted , but the word crisis defender victoria refuses .
so it goes in football , sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse .
but the crisis would in any case not speak .
&quot; i believe that we will win on friday and again it will be good , &quot; said defender západočechů .
victoria &apos;s team will again rely on the support of fans .
&quot; the game is played on a friday night and i would like our fans , who are great to invite . &quot;
&quot; i believe that they repay win , &quot; adds rajtoral .
defend academic freedom , this is true for zemana and ods .
i have repeatedly in recent months called an open letter to students , educators , and management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend the academic freedom of the electoral campaign , conducted by the school president miloš zeman .
i met with more or less success .
rector of masaryk university in brno , who refused to lecture honorary chairman spoz - zemanovci in the pre-election period , for even received retribution in the form of uninvited to celebrate the national day of the czech republic .
here is a list of school officials , who have been so brave and visit milos zeman to : university of technology , hladnov high school in ostrava , university of ostrava business , business academy in cologne , university of je purkyně in Ústí nad labem .
now in pardubice encounter with the continuation of the policy of universities .
the newly elected mp for ods , dean of the faculty of electrical engineering and computer science , university of pardubice , simeon karamazov , refuses to resign from his academic positions and , moreover , he seems normal .
sir , this really is not the same as if you stayed example , the mayor of a small city .
we want to be the captains of the social democrats , who vykovávají capacity as a deputy governor and as they degrade both professions ?
this is telling people that they can handle both of these features challenging left back .
i know we have an example of michal hašek , who even manages dozens of features at once .
but this probably is not the example of a person that you should follow .
we find the opposite and positive example md . Štěpánky frank , who prefer to leave the deputy &apos;s post to be able to fully concentrate on the management of pardubice .
the main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of dean , however , is that the dual functions violate apolitical campuses of the university of pardubice .
leadership in pardubice ods sees your current action at both positions as a benefit for the university .
&quot; their &quot; school , however , you will be able to help without even staying dean .
i think a similar view as mine and rector miroslav ludwig will have your students .
consider therefore still his resignation and keep your face .
otherwise , you may find that you to voters in the next election are counted .
and it does not take long .
john kerry admitted : spying gone too far !
the united states sent in spying sometimes &quot; too far &quot; , he admitted according to afp chief of american diplomacy john kerry during a video conference between washington and london .
collection of information by the minister but served to prevent terrorist attacks .
&quot; the first returns from washington , &quot; according to afp sounded in the middle of intense controversy on both sides of the atlantic because of scandalous revelations about mass data monitoring by the u.s. national security agency ( nsa ) , which has also become the target of u.s. allies .
&quot; in some cases , i admit , as did the president ( barack obama ) , some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that it does not happen in the future , &quot; said kerry .
in the interview , but also defended current practice .
the collection of information is necessary according to him , the fight against terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of 11 september 2001 in the usa , bombings in madrid in march 2004 and london in july 2005 .
&quot; we prevented the fact that the plane fell , the building exploded and people were murdered because we were able to be informed of lying in wait , &quot; said kerry .
however , again admitted that the collection of information &quot; in some cases went disproportionately far . &quot;
the scandal around u.s. intelligence , which reportedly watched by hundreds of millions of telephone calls , broke out in europe this month .
among other things , showed that americans watched and mobile phone to german chancellor angela merkel .
european leaders did not hide their indignation and some of them urged the european union to the united states to try to reach an agreement that would monitor zapovídala or significantly limited .
royal commission heard that before lawsuits against jonathan lord two employees were accused young men christian association ( ymca )
royal commission on the sexual abuse of children learned that before the accusations against the child educators jonathan lord from the city caringbah in 2011 , two employees of the young men christian association ( ymca ) in new south wales were accused of sexual abuse of children .
but before the commission was said that in his opening statement to the association stated that your organization has ever resolved the case of sexual abuse of a child .
executive director phillip hare was asked about the case when one of the employees of the ymca accused of offenses relating to child pornography , and on the other , the gym teacher at the ymca caringbah in 1991 was convicted of sexual abuse of children which he had in his care .
mr. hare said gail furness , advisor committee that he knew about the first case , but the second is not .
he admitted that the opening statement , the ymca was also inaccurate when announcing that the ymca is conducted external audits , which valued the organization as a leading advocate of children &apos;s rights .
evidence before the commission talks about the ymca was advised that the audit of the ministry of education and the office of august this year , received the second lowest of four possible ratings .
mr. hare , who began working with the association of ymca when he was 21 , he admitted that the leadership itself from him down failed when mr. lord has taken , without making sure that your staff is aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety .
earlier this year , the lord convicted for sexual harassment 12 boys committed during the two years when he worked at the ymca .
he was jailed for a minimum of six years .
mr. hare but rejected the claim that the ymca had a cultural problem that prevented staff to report security breaches children , mr. lord .
members of staff gave evidence that they were witnessing such breach , including that the lord was with the children alone , privately guarded them , let them sit with me on his lap , he said to them that he loves them , and let them play with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwellová , which was subordinate to the lord and asked for training children &apos;s safety because she worried about his behavior , testified that jacqui barn , head of services to children in the ymca in caringbah , which was lordovým supervisor was &quot; very intimidating and often was difficult to talk to him about something . &quot;
the director general said that the evidence does not accept the staff that make you feel uncomfortable if they had contacted his superiors and deeds report .
instead , he said that their friendship with lord clouded their judgment , and therefore did not report the problem .
mr. hare said that the board of the ymca in new south wales said its view that the lessons of the &quot; case of jonathan lord &quot; for the organization lies in the fact that the staff &quot; did not have a message , &quot; a council with him as agreed .
mr. hare said the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after an allegation made ​ ​ general manager for services to children in the ymca liam whitley .
he said that the aim was to avoid distortion of the evidence , but was &quot; overly zealous &quot; and poorly made .
an expert on sexual abuse of children , professor stephen smallbone of griffith university told the commission that the ymca in new south wales was not in the years 2009-2011 the organization that would be safe for children .
he said that there will be serious problems in recruiting , screening , implementation , training and management of personnel .
the hearing was adjourned until 20th december .
president of the association of building entrepreneurs of the czech republic vaclav matyas : new green economies should continue
czech construction industry since 2008 , struggling with a continuous decrease in the volume of orders and disregard the state to address the issue of capital construction .
the announcement of the new green savings was a positive sign for our building , especially for small and medium businesses in the regions .
it is a great opportunity for citizens to implementation measures will save a significant amount of heat , but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials .
each billions bring the state more than 2,700 jobs created .
in terms of fiscal policy of the state are significant leverage and multiplier effects , it is also one of the most pro-growth measures .
association of building entrepreneurs of the czech republic therefore fundamentally disagree with the government resolution and asks to take such steps that would allow the continuation of the program , to be announced within the next challenge .
faa : air passengers can now use in aircraft technology gains ( but not make calls from their mobile phones )
the passengers of the airlines will be able to use their electronic devices &quot; from gate to gate &quot; - except calls from their mobile phone - reading , playing games , watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules on thursday issued a federal aviation administration ( faa ) .
passengers but do not expect changes occur immediately .
how quickly will the change will be introduced by different airlines , said faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
airlines will be required to manage faa to demonstrate how their aircraft comply with the new rules and updated training manuals for cabin crew and guidelines for storage facilities in order to comply with the new rules .
faa stated that since some airlines received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
among the companies that have sent the plans are delta and jetblue .
&quot; depending on the condition of such a plan can improve widespread use of electronic devices very quickly , &quot; faa said in a statement .
at present , the passenger is required to turn off their smart phones , tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed .
they can not be turned on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 km and the captain issued the permit .
since passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane drops to land , and do not turn them until the aircraft is on the ground .
under the new rules , the airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference , allowing its passengers to use their devices during takeoff , landing and taxiing , said faa .
since most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers could use the wifi at higher altitudes , it is expected that meets these criteria .
laura gladingová , president of the association of professional stewards , welcomed the changes .
&quot; once the new rules introduced safely - and we stand with transport companies we work closely - it will be a success , &quot; she said in a statement gladingová .
have us frankly tired look as &quot; watchdogs &quot; .
however , surfing the internet , sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will remain below 3 km altitude prohibited , the agency said .
passengers will be advised that their smart phones , tablets and other devices switched to air mode .
so still no words with friends , online scrabble type game played by actor alec baldwin on his smart phone in 2011 , when he was , as is well known , fired from an american airlines plane for refusing to turn off your device when the aircraft was parked at the gate .
a heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that could hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin .
calls from mobile phones will remain on board prohibited .
rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify faa , but the u.s. federal bureau of telecommunications .
faa may in some electronic devices during takeoff and landing lift the ban .
last month mark rosenker of the national committee for transportation safety , an expert on national security in transport at cbs news , said that mobile phones continue to be a risk .
&quot; mobile phones are really a problem , not only because it can potentially create interference with navigation devices , but data from the fcc , we also know that the air can cause interference to broadcast towers , &quot; said rosenker .
a business advisory committee created by the administration of faa therefore , to examine this issue , last month suggested that the government allow wider use of electronic devices .
the faa has in recent years been pressured to ease the restrictions on their use .
critics like senator claire mccaskillová , democrat of missouri , said that there is no valid security reason for this ban .
restrictions have also become more difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous .
some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers may forget to turn off their devices duty or ignores it .
faa began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of the navigation and communication equipment , when passengers began to carry a fm radio , a technical achievement at that time .
new airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems of aircraft than previous generations , but are also designed and approved by the faa to be resistant to electronic jamming .
airlines for several years , offering passengers using wi-fi at cruise altitudes .
plans prepared for wi-fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of airlines would be under the new rules should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices , said huerta .
current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting , than it was for previous generations of devices .
for example , the electronic reader issue when turning pages only minimal transmission .
but broadcasting is stronger when the machine download or upload data .
among those pushing for it to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is amazon.com .
in 2011 , representatives of the company loaded airliner with its kindle electronic reader and perform a test flight , but no problem reappeared .
members of the advisory committee faa expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose a risk .
douglas kidd of the national association of airline passengers said he is confident that interference from these devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aircraft systems , and most of these reports is very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa allow pilots ordered the passengers off the device during instrument flying in low visibility .

the federal government insists that the bailout package worth $ 325 million for the ailing health in tasmania contained harsh conditions to ensure that the state government not to waste resources .
federal health minister tanya pliberseková announced that the commonwealth of australia is &quot; accelerated action &quot; to avert the crisis caused by the aging population of the island , a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders .
funding for four years after the government decided in consultation with an independent member of the tasmanian andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has come up with an emergency rescue package , which we believe will solve the specific problems that the state faces , &quot; said mrs. pliberseková today .
package of $ 325 million includes $ 31 million for operations at the request of the patient .
another 2,600 operations including orthopedic surgery and cataract surgery will help eliminate debt .
money is also open clinics in hobart and launceston , better postoperative care , training of health professionals , mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments respond to the ideas that i &apos;m leading clinicians said that the best way to help tasmánskému healthcare system , &quot; said mrs. pliberseková .
the minister stressed that the tasmanian government must require strict regime of reporting and record-keeping obligations .
the state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money cth , a monthly report on where they are incurred additional funding .
it appointed a three-member committee to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible .
mr wilkie said today that $ 325 million will be useless , &quot; unless followed by real reform in order to lay the basis for sustainable tasmanian public health system . &quot;
nevertheless , praised the government for its response to the request for urgent help , which first flew in negotiations with the prime minister in early may .
&quot; i believe that the federal auxiliary package can extricate national public health from critical condition , &quot; said mr wilkie .
according to the state government selected the following additional procedures significantly reverse the recent cuts .
a spokesman for the federal opposition in health peter dutton believes that today &apos;s statement is just a &quot; patch &quot; .
&quot; the reason i &apos;m here is that the labour government removed from our healthcare system $ 430 million , &quot; he told abc tv .
you can not have a state government that removes almost half a billion dollars , of australia , who pays $ 300 million , and pretend that this is good news .

would have spent up to half of your foot .
supervised by the order and solve problems .
with their knowledge of the environment should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and inhabitants of the area .
in its proposal to reduce security risks , as stipulated in the ministry of interior .
according to him , it would improve the situation in the country has helped especially &quot; the speedy provision of social housing . &quot;
the document discussed by the government .
according to the analysis , it was in the czech republic a few years ago around 300 slum houses and neighborhoods .
lived in them for 80,000 people , mostly roma .
adults in the ghettos were without work , families were dependent on benefits , ended with the children in &quot; special &quot; schools .
ran rampant usury .
according to experts problematic locations between about one hundred were added .
relations between the residents and others come to a head .
in several places were held anti-roma marches .
the extremists were joined by people from the area .
according to police , the interior is challenging in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order .
the essential condition is said to be &quot; consistent gender mainstreaming in law enforcement . &quot;
but they say that without detailed knowledge of the place and the people can not be achieved .
the specialist would attend to errands in the ghetto , where he spent half of its services , the rest would serve in his district .
in the troubled area to oversee the order .
he knew would also local , so he could better solve problems or violations .
&quot; with the establishment of trust specialists will be more easily able to prevent a wide range of infringements , &quot; said the interior .
specialists in ghettos would receive bonuses , and 500 to 1,000 per month .
implementation of special officers to problem areas to be covered by the norwegian funds .
the budget is about € 600,000 ( now about 15.5 million dollars ) .
czech pay 15 percent of the assets , funds 85 percent .
preparations began this year , now handles the detailed design .
the project is to last until 2016 .
the authors were inspired by their neighbors .
this mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in the slovak republic , where is the problem with socially excluded localities incomparably higher than the national average .
&quot; there are so-called roma settlements , &quot; the authors report .
how many specialists in the czech republic should be is not yet clear .
the answer is to give an analysis to determine the place where the policeman was a special need .
it will depend also on how much money these members will be able to police after the project annually released .
according to the project proposal selected first officers undergo internship in the slovak republic .
annually , this training would be to go through five dozen members .
result from them the most suitable candidates .
arise should have special training for police officers who will work in the ghettos .
according to the authors , has helped to improve the situation of mainly social housing .
it should be said to motivate and lead to integration .
according to the ideas of the interior would have three categories .
the minimum standard should meet hostels with well-defined rules , such as the number of persons per room .
central standard would be in smaller apartments .
a higher standard would be social housing , which would be comparable to conventional housing .
tenants would have to perform an integration plan that would have them put together social workers .
they would observe the accommodation order to take care of their health , to send their children to school , retrain and actively looking for work .
if the inclusion of trying , they went by in a higher standard of living .
the permeable housing should face the interior work at least 30 years until the next generation grows up &quot; in the pro-integration motivated environment . &quot;
model of social housing departments to prepare a local development work .

he told the media that bart stands for &quot; and in this case , &quot; but given that it is classified information , bartov can not confirm or deny the arrest .
some media speculated earlier that bart &apos;s arrest could be related to former police commissioner peter lessym .

the villa has moved into the apartment building .
ivana grew up and spent most of his life in apartment villa with garden and swimming pool in one of prague &apos;s most beautiful residential areas on ořechovce .
the original owners of the house but it got back in restitution and tenants had to move out with little severance .
ivana therefore quickly looked for alternative housing for themselves and their already an older mom .
from tip to get familiar apartment 3 + kk in the older block of flats on the opposite side of prague .
&quot; at first it was a shock , but the view from the fourth floor to a large park and dam on the other side of me excited , &quot; says ivana first impression .
at first i thought it would be provisional so for three years .
&quot; today , we live more than thirteen years , and not only because of the gradual reconstruction would not change , &quot; says the owner .
mother and daughter had moved from stodvacetimetrového apartment into a smaller flat 62 m2 , and almost all the facilities were handed out .
action was not easy , things were stored at a friend gradual arranging lasted almost a year .
the new apartment was in pretty good condition , but had done the necessary adjustments , such as painting a door or window replacement .
previous owner crashed kernel , but owner mattered most impractical solutions and unnecessarily large hall , small bathroom , and vice versa .
by combining the two rooms was multifunctional living space .
architects used to define the different zones and broken plaster room , which enabled the new location of the lights .
the first intervention , to which resolved after a few years , was to remove the walls in the living room .
this apartment have changed the layout for 2 + kk , but the room got the airy and open with panoramic views of the surrounding greenery .
the next step to improve the standard has been partially substitute for pvc flooring laminate .
with a bathroom ivana did not know .
for years i &apos;ve collects a magazine about living and looking for inspiration .
in one of them i recently discovered an interesting realization .
on the recommendation so i approached a young architect kamil douděrová .
&quot; it was actually the most important step in the future , &quot; says ivana .
with bathroom remodeling managed to simultaneously adjust the entrance hall .
architect teamed space toilet and a bathroom with two doors hinged wings replacing one sliding , thus reducing space .
the bathroom is timeless and well enough wheelchair accessible .
quality tiles imitating sandstone , the shower is extra comfortable seat , bidet spray at the closet .
successful collaboration with kamila douděrová continued .
within the &apos; how to build a dream was fast , but the fundamental change in the living room , where he participated also the architect martin Čeněk .
in the space formed by the merger of two smaller rooms , we had to get three functions , dining , living and sleeping without the help of optical principles of the classical division , for example , wing bars and japanese sides .
&quot; this would result in breach of openness and uniformity of space , &quot; explains the architect .
we managed to uniquely separate sleeping and living areas .
it was enough to turn itself back two sofas and between them build a custom-made box on duvets .
dining area defined by shades of flooring and painting .
on the floor in the kitchen and dining area used by architect quality marmoleum , sliding doors animated wallpaper with a pattern .
kitchenette , if necessary , cover the sliding panels with wallpaper .
new floor of antiallergic marmolea has a laminate compared to the previous range of benefits : softer non-slippery surface without gaps and better sound insulation .
the niches and ceilings made ​ ​ of plasterboard highlighted color is an example of how you can work with in the block area .
colors i left to the architect , i wished it to be joyful .
&quot; i like the orange , the same color , i also had in the previous apartment , &quot; says ivana .
the lining of grafoskla with blooming magnolia motif is practical and produces a distinctive aesthetic element .
the warm tone energetic architects chose white , underlined that modern functional style .
in a small apartment managed to store books , among others , the area below the window sill .
everything is within reach , lamps are comfortably controlled remotely .
in redoing the interior of the new works great contrast with the older , such as the decades old crystal chandelier with quality works of art , which collects ivana life .
last came a series of kitchen .
boxes were previously deployed on both sides and the owner seemed a bit like a tunnel .
architect reduced the number and distribution of přeskládala .
furniture in simple design is bespoke , white surface softens slightly pearly finish .
in a small space to fit through imaginative solutions washer , dryer and dishwasher .
the appearance of a small kitchen revived all-glass wall cladding above the worktop .
unique grafosklo with digitally printed motif is attractive , in addition to well-maintained .
ivana chose the magnolia blossoms that resemble her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years .
now it seems that it is satisfied here .
the original bathroom was small tub and sink , the new owner chose a neutral shade covering .
large shower has glass doors ronal .
the challenge was to make the environment a clear simple space where function and devices in harmony .
the interior material and color are united and attempted his elegant , cozy , not too cluttered appearance .
&quot; another condition of the assignment was barrier-free solution with minimal obstructions and able to easily move around the furniture and the availability of items of daily use , &quot; says kamila douděrová .
minister holcát restored the head nurse for the czech republic
head nurse for the czech republic should represent the interests of nurses , whose numbers in the czech republic exceeds 100,000 .
&quot; i consider it essential that this function has been clearly defined and formalized to have nurses a representative office within the structure - officials , to which may , if necessary , always ask , &quot; explained martin holcát , minister of health .
i appreciate the work of nurses and i think they deserve a branch of nursing that have been given due attention by the ministry .
in the exercise of this profession requires not only high professional professionalism , but also the human touch and personal beliefs .
&quot; nice and responsible , i will try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses . &quot;
&quot; we have our good health and smart sisters , but i would also appeal to those colleagues who gave us access to their patients do not help to carry out their recruiting with all the empathy and help us in the eyes of the public image of nurses to improve , &quot; says alena Šmídová .
newly appointed head nurse alena Šmídová for the czech republic on the occasion of his taking office also said that he wants to deal with various aspects of the job nurses and intends to cooperate with , among others , professional associations , professional societies , educators , other non-medical professions and doctors .
&quot; basically , i do not want to separate occupational physicians and nurses , but rather see them stand side by side , each with its competencies and together with other medical staff consists of well-coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient . &quot;
&quot; she is facing many problems which professional nurses occur , these difficulties i see and i intend to contribute to their solution . &quot;
these include ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation .
&quot; from my own experience i know that some administrative tasks unnecessarily burden the nurses going in and out of time , which could and should pay better for patients , &quot; says alena Šmídová .
other areas which intends to focus include improving working conditions , finding ways to better work together in a team , and managing health care providers , treatment competencies and labor issues such as respecting the labor code or overloaded insufficient number of nurses in the given time and place .
we often hear anonymous complaints , but that fear of possible sanctions are not documented on the case where the abuse could occur .
&quot; where there is no plaintiff , there is no judge , and would feature the sisters of the czech republic in this case could serve as a guarantee of anonymity of such complaints and the particular case let the relevant authorities to verify , &quot; says alena Šmídová .
mgr . alena Šmídová graduated from the medical school in the field of nurse ( graduated in 1978 ) and the faculty of arts of charles university in prague in the program of nursing - education ( graduated in 1992 ) .
since 2010 he has worked as head of nursing and other paramedical disciplines and recognition of qualifications at the department of education and science , the ministry of health .

jana pětová : step back .
so i decided to take a step back , but when thinking about it , but this is actually not a step but a big jump - jump back a few years , until the memories of my childhood .
it is the memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes , vacuum and do your homework .
although these &quot; duties &quot; , it was mostly just a theory , parents &apos; wishes .
the practice was completely different - run up from school , throw the bag into a corner and run out .
play with other children , ball games , jump shot .
then , when the show helena and her boys embroider chain stitch festive tablecloth for grandma &apos;s birthday .
and only then after several warnings finally wash the dishes , vacuum , winter nanosit wood to tile stoves and tasks to do after dark under a lamp ( or rely on a classmate tasks instead of writing love poems addressed to school sweethearts ) .
morning breakfast homemade strawberry jam ( from real fruit , not the sort of jams that are sold now , in addition to the content of strawberries or not lying ) and drink a tea made from dried herbs that we so love my mom picked .
i also recall those magical evenings when it was a deathly silence in the closet when we are sister taped songs off the radio on cassettes , which revolved loudly in the old tape recorder for my mom .
and then we had to stick the tape rewinding and spending the same one over and over song , our favorite plus a toasted trap .
or we phoned across the table using cans that were tied together with string - and while you &apos;re at it calls us to be better heard , it was necessary to thoroughly clean the ears , then uchošťour the width + cotton .
the minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now , and my parents were able to live from it so that we lack nothing .
we did not need you any iphone , ipad or even mobile phones and laptops or designer clothes .
clothing was handed down from generation to generation and the best &quot; increment &quot; in the closet was home-made tie-dyed t-shirt using sava .
the electronics we managed to the satisfaction of the said mom &apos;s cassette player and make the most walkman , which we have shared with my sister and we just casually used the same train on a school trip .
it seemed to us interesting to play with my aunt kloboučku hop or ludo or , as i have said to go &quot; just &quot; out .
when i was a little older we got for christmas video player , sure to conserve his parents for a long time , but unfortunately it did not warm up with us for a long time .
my younger sister to him narwhal strudel , apparently so beautifully papal those tapes and tried if spap and strudel .
unfortunately spapal , but it was his last bite .
well , this story still has , poor thing , on a plate from my dad all the time .
she says that when she was little lenka , narwhal strudel into the video and thought that it plays a recipe not to play , so it still can not bake .
i remember how we were all able to communicate , communicate without a phone , computer .
together with her sister we were on vacation at his grandmother &apos;s granddaughter talked with a neighbor when we meet again next summer for grandmas - and so it was , that &apos;s true .
we met .
promise you now with someone that you will see in a year ? !
i also remember the winter when we ran out of the entire village , built snowmen , rode on a snowy hill at the church on bags stuffed with hay .
then we together with the whole family had dinner and talked about the day .
of course my sister and i used to hear every night before the notorious phrase , &quot; go wash your hands ! &quot;
yes , it is true today , but definitely not in the bathroom to tap bound soap in a net of lemons .
after dinner , when dad in the garage &quot; worked &quot; in beer with jarda from the village , we lie down with my mom on the floor , resting his feet on the stove , opened the door and looked at the flame and listen to the crackling that poured through the stove .
we were close - really - we did not count how many we have friends on the social network , we knew how much we have friends , real ones !
we talked - we talked - we did not write daily messages through various chats , sms .
nothing of the sort , and yet we knew about each other a lot more .
and so i could continue for a long time .
it &apos;s nice to remember , especially if i add these memories by looking through the album there , where are neatly glued black corners due to black and white photos .
and if i happen to know how old i was then , back photos is always written in the year the picture was taken .
watch that although we haircuts by not suit pots too , and we should pant after cousin of two larger numbers , no one before us laugh , it was so normal ( not in ) .
and i prefer to turn back on that step forward - into reality .
in 2013 , i &apos;ll wait and see what the modern age must invent one for my kids .
what i do know is that these are now my memories for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere &quot; a hundred years behind the times &quot; and i think a lot come to this &quot; předopičí &quot; for not experience too .
i would like to wish them !

the new civil code prepared by six of the ten companies
on approaching the efficiency of the new civil code and the law on corporations 1 january 2014 was gearing up six out of ten companies .
only eight percent of the interviewed company representatives said that matters relating to the two key codes in their company did not address at all .
it results from a survey ambruz &amp; dark deloitte legal , which examined the views of 108 czech firms .
in connection with the approaching date of effectiveness of the two key codes can only just at the last moment , a number of managers are beginning to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies .
the biggest changes in private law for the last 50 years is , in our opinion , affect all citizens and businesses in the country .
because of maneuvering politicians lived long in the business sector uncertain about whether the revolutionary changes ultimately will or not .
&quot; now they are left with only a few weeks to go to the new law passed for their company without complications , &quot; commented partner ambruz dark deloitte &amp; legal jan spáčil .
of the 61 percent of companies heavily engaged in new labour 26 percent said that their companies had taken all the necessary steps to be ready in time .
in addition , 35 percent of companies that number is going to take the necessary measures in the near future .
against this , every fifth company recodification not yet been addressed , but has definite ideas about how to prepare for them .
overall , 11 percent no opinion and fails to consider the issue .
only eight percent of companies admit that issues related to the recodification not been addressed .
the most important legal issue related to the new civil code for the largest number of surveyed companies signing new contracts ( 21 percent ) , followed by resolution of commercial conditions ( 16 percent ) and changes in the real estate and the responsibility for the damage ( ten percent ) .
for contracts takes place one of the most important news across recodification , editing and union contracts only under the new civil code .
current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial code shall expire , with the result that the contract law should stand for citizens and businesses easier .
&quot; for entrepreneurs new legislation will offer many new products with emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relations , &quot; said the lawyer ambruz dark deloitte &amp; legal luke subjects .
in connection with the business corporations act deems the most important topic almost a quarter said the issue of increasing the liability of statutory authorities .
then there are issues related to changes in the convening and conduct of general meetings ( 15 percent ) and representation of the company ( 14 percent ) .
new legislation is stricter obligations and potential impacts to the statutory authorities , particularly in a situation where companies threaten to bankrupt or gets into it .
&quot; in practice this means that if members of boards of directors and executives of companies do not act with due diligence and avert imminent bankruptcy of the company , they may lose the benefit obtained for the performance of their duties until the last two years , &quot; said spáčil .
revealed nsa increasing social paranoia monitoring by the state
one peaceful day to the end of august the german police helicopter buzzed over the u.s. consular office in frankfurt , the capital of the german economy .
at the direction of the federal office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the german domestic intelligence agency , the purpose of the mission was to take photos of roofs american outpost , which is located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
german media claims that the office bfv hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas , and this action launched in berlin exchange between the american and the german foreign minister .
james clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence , in september again insisted that the united states used its foreign intelligence capabilities , &quot; to steal trade secrets for the benefit of foreign companies and u.s. companies to strengthen their international competitiveness and increase their profits . &quot;
but since then , the edward snowden , who became an informant from a co-worker , began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the united states , european governments and business leaders already know , if they believe the words of the director .
following reports that the u.s. national security agency spied in the brazilian oil company , gained access to data under the control of u.s. cloud providers , including google and yahoo reached a general paranoia about the state tracking new dimensions .
the final straw came with the revelation that the phone chancellor angela merkel was maybe ten years old bugged .
if the target can be the most powerful person in europe , they are certainly potential targets and business leaders .
snowden made ​ ​ translucent intense collaboration between u.s. intelligence services and companies .
i would say that it is possible that the data is used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany needs to wake up , &quot; said oliver grün , president of bits , which represents small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
according to a survey published in july advisory service ey german companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft , the u.s. now represents as great a risk as china .
throughout the documentation revealed mr. snowden but so far there is no evidence that the united states passed on trade secrets foreign firms in their own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu lacks certain skills in it and the internet , and said they should seek to reduce its dependence on the usa :
business leaders are skeptical towards it .
from the german parliament , the voices that we should make the german google .
i can just close my eyes and opened them again slowly ...
that is not the way , says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software company sap .
if someone wanted a strong european it industry , it did 20 years ago , let it die .
everything in germany is subsidized , from coal to cars and farmers .
everything but the it industry .
the scope and technical sophistication of u.s. spy agencies discovered snowden is for some companies who still believed that the greatest threat is the monitoring of china , yet shocking .
now is a great turnover in cloud computing , where european leaders in a broad range realized that the data stored in the u.s. fall under local jurisdiction , and are therefore potentially open to challenge .
according to a survey carried out by the business community cloud security alliance about 10 percent of non-us members after unveiling the usa prism data mining abandoned plans to use cloud provider based in the usa .
jim snabe , one of the ceos of sap , said : &quot; we have a new question for customers who have not been here before - where my data is stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction remain physically ? &quot;
many high-ranking german officials argue that the latest messages are just confirming what we already knew : that powerful nations want to steal their most precious secret , and this data must be protected at all costs .
that is carried out economic espionage is not a surprise .
it always happened .
&quot; it is a vital topic for many years and will not change significantly even during the current debate , &quot; said kurt bock , ceo of basf agrochemical company .
americans we conducted espionage on commercial and industrial level , as we carry out spying on them , because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses .
enterprise leaders generally do not want to brag too countermeasures that have made that possibly not provided by the attacker advantage .
in the case of large companies have a long history recalls that marry the fair free usb memory drive or leave unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise .
ulrich hackenberg , member of the board carmaker audi said that for many years it is common practice to collect before the meeting of the board of cell phones , they can not be used as a listening device .
the german office bfv managers like to consider whether not to use when traveling abroad easy prepaid cell phones because of the risk that smart phones can embezzle .
prepaid cell phones are then discarded .
however , there is concern that smes will continue to hacking and tracking vulnerable .
in germany , many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market .
&quot; small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access , &quot; he warns in his report bfv .
usa his own company warns of economic espionage from other countries .
according to the washington post cited u.s. national intelligence estimate reported in february france , in addition to russia and israel in the second row offenders who engage in hacking activities for economic newsletters , ranked behind china .
member of the board in risk-free german company concluded that in terms of economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bernard squarcini , former head of the french internal intelligence agency dcri , this month in an interview said : &quot; the service is completely know very well that all countries , although they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , espionage carried out to its allies . &quot;
new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasures of smoking
scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine , which may withdraw the pleasures of smoking cigarettes .
a single dose of the vaccine was able to protect life mouse to dependence on nicotine .
before testing on humans is necessary to perform additional tests that take several years , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical faculty in new york , says that early indications are good .
&quot; we hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit and have exhausted all methods available in the market today , but found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that the current approaches overcome all , &quot; said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information to create antinikotinových antibodies .
the virus selectively infects liver cells , which then begin to create a steady stream of these antibodies .
antibodies persecute any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get to the brain , thereby preventing the smoker get the nicotine hit .
in tests vaccinated mice were subsequently delivered nicotine , continue their normal activities .
but the mice that were not vaccinated , &quot; calm &quot; , said the researchers , which is a sign that they had received nicotine to the brain .
experimenty jsou popsány v časopise science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccine have failed because they contained antibodies .
the injections have to be administered as frequently to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies , however proved expensive and impractical .
the cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because the liver cells to convert factories antibodies .
professor crystal said that if future vaccine for humans will be completely safe , could be given to children before they have the taste of a cigarette a try , and would avoid the addiction to nicotine .
more likely , it would not have used smokers to quit .
&quot; they know that when they start smoking again , because of the nicotine vaccine that will have no benefit , and it will help them kick the habit , &quot; he said .
british scientists said the results were interesting , but cautioned that more research is needed .
the desperate cry of the obama voters
i voted for obama twice - i shared the hope of a possible change
he says that obama &apos;s sincere efforts to stymie the obstruction of the republican party
obstruction can not excuse woes websites obama health care or unmanned attack aircraft
memoirs of the obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could happen
nathaniel p. morris second year studying medicine at harvard .
these days i read terribly sad book .
about this book , i thought that i was in the bleak days of my second year of medical school to encourage and restore in me a pinch of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( boldness to win ) and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when i finish the evening opinions of patients and go to bed , the book brings me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches will take your breath away .
election ended overwhelming and television news are forcing us to think about the historical value of this moment .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents hid the newspaper he could find .
the white house team headed young visionaries and the nation was ready for a change .
during the inauguration in 2008 had 82 percent support obama .
and here i close the book .
jump to the present is harsh awakening like to discuss with a dream .
it &apos;s hard to commemorate those optimistic days - they seem distant memories , sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years after i threw my first ballot , really has changed .
it was certainly nothing of what i had imagined .
i recognize that obama achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law of care available through the removal of our troops from iraq and the policy of &quot; do not ask questions , to say nothing &quot; after the killing of osama bin laden .
furthermore , i believe that partisan obstruction reversed so much effort to move our nation forward : the other is that immigration reform , public option to choose health care and the closure of guantánamo .
but in many situations where i had colleagues and friends defended the obama administration , i respect the explanations that can provide , reached the absolute limit .
i found myself in the place of political hopelessness .
obstruction of the republicans can not explain the agreement with intercepting foreign leaders or the drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas .
unable to explain to them that the national security agency collects data about the private lives of americans , nor that persecutes those who expose government misconduct .
they can not be held responsible for the execution of anwar al-awlakího , an american citizen , without trial or for limiting public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign .
they can not justify the report &apos;s findings , saying that white house efforts to silence the media are &quot; the most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
a recently nor excuse the failure to create more than three years after the signing of the act of care available to a simple website .
i do not know whether something like this could be expected .
whether i had 18 years to suspect that the power of government may be in conflict with political campaigns that preceded it .
elected office obviously has a predictable course and our public conversations will shape the opposition political party and random events , such as the massacre in newton .
however , all of the examples i mentioned above , to a large extent seem to be the result of his own administration &apos;s decision .
and that bothers me the most .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was excited about his candidacy .
mitt romney presented a confusing nevybroušenou alternative and seemed to be unable to consolidate its policy or position .
i felt that a second term for obama , freed from the pressure of the next election , filled with hope , which we had heard .
nevertheless , it is a return to 2008 - with how support for obama this week fell below 45 % - through this book becomes increasingly difficult .
it makes me remember the series of promises that are lost .
this week i read a chapter in a book about how obama during the primaries in pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with clinton .
the additional meeting during the campaign he told his staff that he had to get back up to speed and stay true to our mission .
&quot; i want to back our magic , &quot; he said .
we must not forget who we are .
five years later , mr. president , and totally agree with you .

alexei miller of gazprom says pipeline in bulgaria launches a new era of gas
start of construction of south stream gas pipeline in bulgaria means the start of one of europe &apos;s largest energy projects , said the director of gazprom .
&quot; today we are witnessing a milestone : started construction on the bulgarian part of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , &quot; said gazprom president alexei miller in a statement .
this project is a key element of energy security of the european continent .
south stream pipeline would add diversity to the russian export routes across europe .
contractual dispute between gazprom and its partners in ukraine , which brings most of russian gas to europe , adds to the risk of conventional routes , officials say .
miller says that direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are &quot; all &quot; removed .
once the project starts in 2015 its operation , bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream gas pipeline at a discounted price .
gazprom says that the building is in other countries in the direction of flow begin later this year .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
early puberty : mature earlier
research has shown that afro american and latina reach puberty earlier than their white peers .
physical changes do not mean that approaching puberty
there is no evidence that for these hormones or other chemicals
experts say that one of the starters earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity .
the trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys .
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children &apos;s health and family issues .
should the mother horrified when her daughter begin to grow breasts and pubic hair in 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual meeting of the american academy of paediatricians this week in orlando , florida explains pediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz , that these physical changes among american girls are quite common and represent a new standard .
&quot; a lot of time was spent by my parents assured that this is not usually the sign of a rapid evolution towards full puberty , &quot; said kaplowitz
visible signs of development , such as breast development , pubic and underarm and body odor , the girls appear earlier .
over the last forty years , however , was only a small shift in the age when menstruation occurs first .
in the united states there are now an average age of 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years of age in 1970 .
&quot; when you start to develop breasts , pass a minimum of two to three years , pending the first period , &quot; said kaplowitz , who is also the author of &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem &quot; ( early puberty in girls : essential guide for the management of this frequent problem )
the most reliable test of how puberty will continue , it &apos;s time .
discussion about what activates the real beginning of puberty , but if it is accompanied by the growth of breast growth spurt before 8 years of age , a girl is considered &quot; precocious &quot; .
in most cases , the process slows down or stops - which can paediatricians carefully monitored .
faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist performed tests to exclude serious problems , such as a tumor or cyst .
there are treatments that delay the early menstruation and prevent further consequences : premature aging of the bones , which can ultimately lead to cessation of growth stunting in adulthood .
recommendations on medications and hormonal therapy are dependent on the child &apos;s age , speed of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .
psychosociologické are also important aspects .
when it comes to medication , kaplowitz is cautious , but acknowledges that &quot; the suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems girl and her feelings of being different from their peers . &quot;
of course is another big problem : parents simply do not want their very young daughters had menstruation .
&quot; i &apos;m worried that it may become pregnant , or how it will cope with hygiene , &quot; said kaplowitz .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started having menstrual periods at age 10 .
although there were signs of menstruation and we talked , was not ready emotionally .
she came home from school frightened and upset , that is the first of her friends .
there are many well-known theories about the causes of early puberty .
even though there is no coherent body of evidence that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
boys - like girls - reaching puberty earlier .
kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity .
in 2001 helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years , which connects the body fat with the timing of puberty .
other findings support that conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country the afro american and latina tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .
the explanations range .
from a global point of view , it seems that patterns of early puberty are affected by everything from economic conditions through climate to genes .
next puzzle : although boys are already at an early age appears hair on the face and pubic area , the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls .
other physicians participating in the conference of the american association of paediatricians ( aap ) have added to the complexity of this topic further .
acne and pubic hair is common even among infants and toddlers .
&quot; we have to be careful as to how to identify the true onset of puberty , &quot; said lawrence silverman , pediatric endocrinologist from goryebské children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to get from your child &apos;s doctor instructions on how to talk with your child .
&quot; it may involve the need to talk with your child earlier than expected , &quot; he kaplowitz .
if you are calm , your child will probably respond well .
girls who develop earlier , they need assurance that even if this is done too early , the process is a normal part of life .

waiting is a decisive battle .
lebanese hezbollah deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of damascus in preparation for the decisive battle of the mountainous region kalamún .

they are equipped with radar , although after firing shots off so it &apos;s hard to focus .

cssd bargains sobotka .
social democracy is crumbling , the christian democrats and babišovci together and talk about to a common approach .
if social democrats in a few weeks policeman pulls himself together , will sit at the negotiating table with a perfectly well-coordinated partners who put on the table ready list of demands , including ministerial posts .
ambassadors cssd then either eaten sour grapes coalition or capricious nod to a minority government .
bohuslav sobotka after four days , when carried on a wave of sympathy for the first time encountered .
yesterday he could not dominate the political board is a convicted liar , especially to force him to resign .
confirmed negotiator for the party is not only on , other team members will be allowed until after the crucial meeting of the central executive committee ( dvv ) .
i apologized to the members of the team and now the citizens .
lying is not , in private life or in public .
&quot; it was a mistake , &quot; he said after meeting senior management of social democracy michal hašek .
he added that the post of first vice-cling .
&quot; his decision will tell november 10 at dvv , &quot; said hasek .
similarly , also spoke cssd deputy chairman zdenek Škromach and chief parliamentary club jerome tejc .
he , however , pointed out that he had been elected only two days before .
both deputies then said that they will do everything to make a fifty cssd sounded one voice .
theater of the absurd put on the crown michal hašek sentence : &quot; i am a member of the social democrats fifteen years , i have always been loyal to the brand and i respected the decision of the party organs . &quot;
so another lie live .
or perhaps you are asked to sobotka &apos;s resignation and his exclusion from the negotiating team forgot that august dvv has passed the 57 percent that bohuslav sobotka &apos;s party candidate for prime minister ?
the head of the social democrats , however , convening dvv until next sunday made ​ ​ a powerful army of enemies .
his opponents have ten days in which to flood the e-mails 192 members of this body and the media hodgepodge of all sorts of gossip and rumors , possibly remind real errors sobotkovÁ political career .
it will be mightily to wash dirty linen will appear dark hints of an alliance between the mine owner zdenek bakala and sobotkovým wing .
it will discuss a friendly relationship bohuslav sobotka and influential lawyer radek pokorny .
vybublají disputes in the south moravian-silesian organization or cssd .
the warning words of the mayor of ostrava and allies petra sobotka kajnar : &quot; i signed charter 77 so that the country ruled by idiots . &quot;
if dvv met this weekend , liars would probably have been forced to ritual sacrifice their functions .
traitors to sprinkle ashes and head remain .
a triumphant moment cssd will end up with a nickname bohuslav pyrrha .

putin promised ecological olympics , denting his plan secret giant landfill
fans of winter sports already cut meter in the olympic games in sochi , others to prepare them staring with growing concern .
russian olympics , even to begins in february , is faced with another scandal .
russians seem to fail to fulfill a promise that preparations for the games and not in the least interfere nature in krasnodar region at the foot of the caucasus , where for four months targets thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors .
indeed , after the olympics in vancouver , the russians had built the bar very high , the canadian game in the history of the olympics enrolled as environmentally friendly as possible .
however , it seems that the commitment of russian president vladimir putin to organize games with &quot; zero waste &quot; , it took a long time for her .
ap reporters last week discovered a giant landfill construction material in achštyr village near sochi .
then dump full of building materials , tires , drums and insulating foams found in august environmentalists , which immediately reported .
russian authorities sludge and landfill disappeared .
but only for a while .
last week , reporters greeted look at a landfill the size of three football fields .
not only , in such places , several described the british newspaper the times .
on-site work russian railways , the state monopoly , which is being built around šedesátikilometrovou way between the airport in sochi and sports resort .
the company , which had swallowed 280 billion rubles , led one of putin &apos;s close associates vladimir yakunin .
in august , the railroad prevented the landfill founded one of the subcontractors .
local residents but they are desperate .
the inhabitants achštyru around the village for three months , day and night driving trucks full of waste material .
according to experts , there is a risk that the waste contaminating the local river mzymta , more streams and eventually the black sea .
&quot; the water here sočské contaminate water sources for the next ten to fifteen years , &quot; he told the sheet vladimir kimajev of environmental non-profit organization ewnc .
illegal dumps are not the only problem of the russian organizing committee and government .
the most expensive olympics in history , according to the opposition are a large tunnel .
for comparison : games in sochi will cost $ 51 billion , while the summer olympics in beijing in 2008 came to 43 billion .
last year &apos;s games in london only cost $ 19 billion and said the vancouver nine billion .
apart from corruption scandals and project delays worry if eventually be enough snow , too , there were reports that while working on the show and sports infrastructure , poor human rights records .
last month , one of the workers sewed his mouth to protest that he had not paid for two months .
many are also worried about how the russian organizers during the games popasují with the new law , which bans the promotion of homosexuality .
some visitors are about to russian gays to support the olympics .
rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft remain in australia for the time being in force
australian airline passengers will have to remain off their tablets and smartphones during starting and landing regardless of the changes in the u.s. to the relaxation of regulations regarding these devices .
the u.s. federal aviation administration ( faa ) gave american space companies to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read on their devices electronic books , watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight , when the device will remain in the &quot; aircraft &quot; mode .
passengers can already do this throughout most of the flight , but many poisons that can have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing .
australian carriers are exploring the decision by u.s. carriers requires a lot of work to meet the requirements , but indicated that they have no near term plan to change their practices .
office of civil aviation security ( casa ) also said that the announcement explored , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in australia are still in force .
&quot; casa currently has no specific legislation regulating the use of electronic devices in flight , &quot; he said .
this issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that at all times the safety is maintained and that passengers are acting in accordance with the recommendations they receive from members of the crew .
virgin , which has already talked with casa to extend the use of its inflight entertainment system , wi-fi , the change was tilted , but announced that the decisions of the regulatory authority .
&quot; we would like to casa office conducted an analysis permission to use the electronic device , because i really think it would be now , when we have ( wireless onboard entertainment ) , improve the customer experience , &quot; said the spokesman .
qantas announced that it will hold for the time being current regulations .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing , and we do not intend to change any time soon , &quot; he said .
faa regulations apply to u.s. airlines .
we constantly are also interested in developments in the regulatory regions , which can be useful for our passengers , and be sure to thoroughly study the faa decision and the reasons for it are .
in the case of u.s. carriers , the impact of regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet .
carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate interference to radio handsets , and also revise manuals , training materials and programs for hand baggage and passenger information .
&quot; once the airline confirms its fleet tolerance , may allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices , such as tablets , e-readers and smartphones , at any altitude , &quot; said the faa .
in rare cases , low visibility crew directing passengers to get off the device during landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices during takeoff and descent safely stored under the seat or in an overhead storage compartment .
nonsense in the movie gravity are , but it &apos;s a beautiful sight , experts say
fantastic film of gravity of the universe some time after sold-out premiere in czech cinemas .
october saw him by the union of film distributors nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million .
most of the reviews assesses positively the image .
others , however , there are some inconsistencies .
server lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and if you noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film .
george dusek ( director of the observatory and planetarium brno ) : i love sci-fi movies that i think are modern , dreamy fairy tale .
film gravity is included , while acting as a &quot; physically real &quot; performance .
no , but that does not mean it was bad .
i enjoyed it very much .
note the hair you need to sandra bullock , who somehow raises in a state of weightlessness .
hubbův space telescope and the international space station after moving significantly different orbits , so they can not be seen in one shot .
some viewers of the film accuse unrealistically acting effect and the whole fire behavior in weightlessness .
the suits would have also withstood such wounds .
the heroes in the movie gravity often come into conflict with various objects and clothing without too much trouble all last .
critics were not spared either storyline .
so vast tragedy in earth orbit , according to some panelists unrealistic .
in addition , they wonder why the doctor was sent into space to repairing equipment .
people on the forums arguing about &quot; unreal &quot; behavior lan .
it is said to act like it was designed for bungee jumping .
marcel grün ( director of the observatory and planetarium . prague ) : i saw him not only to the wide screen , but i can definitely say i was enchanted .
i &apos;m glad it was not a documentary film , but science-fiction .
and with such a story , the author has the right ( almost duty ) not to hold consistently reality .
&quot; more than you mentioned discrepancies me touching it , as is shown three times the space station with the degrading level of technology ( last chinese ) . &quot;
&quot; china will indeed until the end of the decade and will probably look better than the movie . &quot;
vladimír karas ( director of the astronomical institute of the academy of sciences ) : the computer-generated scenes , the authors successfully trying not to violate the laws of physics , so sciences , facing the viewer will appreciate that the various cosmic collisions and crashes quite rightly maintains momentum , speaking dictionary physics , also view of the earth from space is very realistic , including thin-skinned atmosphere and aurora flickering on the polar regions .
irregularities are considered in detail surely find it .
additionally , for example , when i read comments found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appear to reverse than it should in fact be ( from west to east ) .
george stephen ( an employee of the astronomical institute of the academy of sciences of the czech republic ) : some things filmmakers adapted to their needs , but no fundamental and egregious offense against logic or the laws of nature , i noticed in the film and in comparison with other films with similar aims is to see that the creators made a point of credibility to the events displayed .
the moments that do not make sense worth naming the fact that the hubble space telescope orbits the otherwise inclined orbit than the iss .
the result is significantly different relative speed and rescue operation would , therefore , could not in fact take place , as was shown in the film .
furthermore , at the moment of separation kowalski ( clooney ) and stone ( bullock ) , i noticed that the whole iss rotated , so it is not clear the origin of the forces acting on kowalski , who makes both actors to undertake at the moment , when it is not moving against each other .
bombardier profit fell due to a decrease in supply orders
canadian aircraft manufacturer bombardier trains and announced on thursday fifteen percent decline in net profit , which is due to the smaller number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in the drive train .
bombardier is headquartered in montreal , also published any data on air test for its new cseries aircraft type , nor offered current information as to whether the aircraft complies with the ambitious plan to begin commercial operation by next september .
after the inaugural test flight about a month and a half plane flew only three times and raised the question of whether the testing phase is well advanced .
the results did not meet estimates and shares on the toronto stock exchange declined by 8 percent .
state bank analyst cameron doerksen fell on thursday rating of &quot; higher return &quot; to &quot; power sector &quot; with the expectation that the market will be over the next quarter or two experiencing limited growth .
&quot; while smaller aircraft deliveries are mostly expected profit margins in the transport us greatly disappointed , &quot; doerksen said in a note to clients .
as the test program will continue , we believe that the company gets new bombardier cseries aircraft orders .
if you will not be announced in the coming months , no new orders , we expect the market to grow skepticism towards this program .
bombardier hopes that the cseries aircraft type fight their way into the lower area of ​ ​ the market that is now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was unveiled in march , after months of delay in the first flight took place in september .
the number of firm orders cseries aircraft achieves modest 177 but because potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight in order to verify the allegation regarding the low power consumption and cost savings of this airliner .
currently , a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators .
executive director pierre beaudoin expected that , when the first commercial aircraft to use to reach your goal bombardier 300 firm orders .
executives also on thursday assured analysts and media , the program proceeds according to plan .
&quot; the test aircraft remained on the ground for longer than expected , &quot; he said in a conference call beaudoin and noted that examination of the earth and software upgrades are scheduled during the downtime of the aircraft .
each manufacturer is different plans .
we decided to attend the first flight and then focus on the update and we did .
this will happen during the entire flight program .
according to bombardier , the second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other shortly thereafter .
analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer to start to operate the cseries aircraft 12 months after its first flight .
bombardier claims that evaluate your plan putting the aircraft into service in the coming months and will provide updated information .
&quot; this slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in accordance with internal company plan bombardier - probably reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; said doerksen .
of the u.s. $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share in the previous year in the third quarter ending 30 september net profit fell bombardier 147 million , or 8 cents per share .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents .
turnover decreased marginally from 4.2 billion to 4.1 billion usd .
according to the thomson reuters ibes analysts expected return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion .
the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that compared to 57 aircraft a year before he added during the quarter just 45 aircraft .
net orders dropped from 83 aircraft at the 26th
unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division accounted for 30 september 32.9 billion , which is unchanged at 31 december .
&quot; results in aviation were in line with our views , but low intake of orders and the overall state of the market has let us down , &quot; said beaudoin .
revenue in the aerospace industry declined by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the largest train manufacturer in the world , said that revenue in this division grew by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion usd .
unfulfilled contracts in transport accounted for 30 september 32.6 billion , which is compared to 31 december marginal growth .
the profit margin in the transport division was due to problems with the implementation of several large contracts .
executives said that the fourth quarter will be provided new perspectives .
shares of bombardier , which also announced the arrival of google cfo patrick pichettea , dropped during trading on thursday afternoon by 8.5 per cent to $ 4.83 .
the brazilian company embraer sa , the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor to bombardier , announced thursday ten percent drop in quarterly profit .

as a result of the tax on owners of foreign real estate bubble bursting london
ministry of finance has calculated the pre-tax income from financial assets , but is awaiting the final decision of mr osborne , who in the budget of 2012 introduced a fee of 7 % for the transfer of property for buildings valued above £ 2,000,000 and annual fees for buyers who own property within society , rather than as individuals .
fees for transfer of property in housing stock in the districts of westminster and kensington and chelsea , which in fiscal year 2012 / 13 amounted to £ 708 million , already exceeds the total for northern ireland , wales , scotland , north east , north west and yorkshire and humber together .
mr cook said : &quot; due to the increase in the transfer of property at the homes of high value and performance related legislation to prevent tax avoidance , it is very difficult to argue that the high value is a little taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated system of the poll tax . &quot;
he added that &quot; this measure could in some foreign investors cause property in london are reluctant to buy , or that the current owners are reluctant to sell &quot; .
