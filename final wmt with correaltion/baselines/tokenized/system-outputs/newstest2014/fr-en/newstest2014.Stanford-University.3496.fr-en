the nsa case underscores the total lack of debate on intelligence
how to explain the contradictory attitude of the french government , which on the one hand , the public is frustrated by summoning the us ambassador on october 21 , and the other prohibits the overflight by the bolivian presidential plane , on the basis of the rumour of the presence on board of edward snowden ?
according to me , there are two levels of response from the french government .
when fran√ßois hollande phone to barack obama , or when the minister of foreign affairs laurent fabius summoned the us ambassador , they react to a real discovery , which is the size of the american surveillance on all communications in france .
it is not surprising to read in the columns of the world a few weeks on the one hand the reproduction of the american diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the quai d &apos;orsay eavesdropping by the nsa ?
is there not as a wave of hypocrisy from you ?
the journalistic process is not a moral position , but research interest and relevance of information to enable every citizen to form an opinion .
when wikileaks lifts the veil on the analysis by american diplomacy for political or other issues around the world , we believe that , in the light of american power , this is a major lighting .
when we describe the u.s. interception systems against the french diplomacy in the united states , it is in any case to be outraged at this practice is to describe the world as it is .
france has benefited from information supplied by the nsa on terrorist operations against our interests ?
can we deny the american collaboration ?
the establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools to intercept very powerful in the united states , but also by france , was officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
moreover , in this field , france and the united states have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described by both sides as critical .
for example , the presence of mohammed merah in the tribal areas in washington was reported to the french thanks to the nsa .
france can be conducted , for example , to send entire blocks of data on the sahel region of the u.s. , and in exchange-already quickly said , americans can give information to the french on other parts of the world .
so the question of substance behind the nsa case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to develop tools to intercept , that the question of the total absence of prior debate , notably in the parliaments , the justification of such systems , which must be theirs , and , in the end , the issue of attacks on freedoms .
that is a real risk that the united states ? a degradation of their image ?
it is fine to denounce them , i don &apos;t see how they can be punished .
the risk for the americans can be double .
the first is when their allies - and that was the case recently-learn that their leaders , sometimes at the highest levels of their state , were monitored .
this is the case of brazil and germany , two countries with diplomatic relations with the united states are strained .
another effect can be more economical to him : as more european or south american companies are reluctant , in light of the revelations , to entrust their confidential data for us contractors subject to american laws , and thus the influence of the nes .
the last element : the vast movement of revelations by the world &apos;s media , which contributes to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services of hitherto almost non-existent , could push the legislators , including americans , to reconsider the credentials that they have given to their intelligence services .
barack obama receives the iraqi prime minister , in full spate of violence
the american president was to receive on friday 1 november 2013 iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki , seeking u.s. help to combat the greatest wave of violence for five years .
iraq has experienced in october the most deadly month for five and a half years , according to figures released friday , november 1 , by the iraqi authorities .
964 people have died in the violence in october , whose 855 civilians , 65 policemen and 44 soldiers and 1,600 people were injured .
the un provides a stock even higher with 979 deaths and 1,902 injured .
the violence is most deadly despite tightened security measures and military operations launched last month by the government of nouri al-maliki , dominated by shiites .
the total number of deaths in october is the highest since april 2008 , when 1,073 people were killed .
about two years after the withdrawal of american troops , the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration as neighboring syria is engulfed in a civil war .
the bombs struck markets , mosques , weddings and funerals .
men are killed in the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
the growing discontent among the sunni minority , in power under saddam hussein , who complains of being marginalized politically and to be the target of unjust arrests , led to the outbreak of violence .
on friday , new violence killed four people in the north of iraq , in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the detonation of five car bombs north of baghdad .
much of the violence has been attributed to the islamic state in iraq and the levant ( eiil ) , a group affiliated with al-qaida ( sunni extremists ) , also involved in the civil war in syria .
nouri al maliki wants a &quot; global war &quot; against al-qaida .
the violence is at the centre of discussions in the united states the prime minister nouri al maliki , who will be received on friday by president barack obama , two years after their previous meeting , on december 12 , 2011 .
at the time , the american president , elected on the promise to put an end to the military engagement in the country , had painted an optimistic picture of the situation .
since his arrival on wednesday in washington , nouri al maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive and the elected members of congress .
on thursday , he pleaded for the international community leads a &quot; third world war &quot; against al-qaida .
the principle of increased aid to iraq &apos;s security is supported by influential senators , republicans and democrats .
but they also criticized nouri al maliki , a shiite , granting him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &quot; sectarian and authoritarian politics . &quot;
they also demanded president barack obama that he will make it clear to nouri al maliki that &quot; the pernicious influence of iran in the iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . &quot;

the vatican probe on contraception , divorce and homosexuality .
the vatican has undertaken a large survey around the world on how the parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception , divorce and same-sex couples of the same sex .
the survey asked participants how priests are gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being married .
the survey was sent in mid-october to each national conference of bishops , with instructions to get the most possible answers .

the new vaccine could remove the pleasure cravings to smoke
scientists have developed a vaccine that cravings could remove the pleasure that it takes to smoke a cigarette .
one dose of the vaccine could protect life of nicotine addiction .
further testing is needed before testing on humans , but dr. ronald crystal of the weill cornell medical college in new york said the early signs were encouraging .
&quot; we really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all methods available on the market today , but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches , &quot; said cornell professor .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design antibodies cravings .
the virus infects selectively liver cells , which then began to produce a steady stream of antibodies .
the antibodies are tracking all the molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smoker to have her dose of nicotine .
in tests , the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine then continued their normal activity .
but the mice that were not vaccinated &quot; abated &quot; , said the researchers , signs that the nicotine had reached their brain .
the experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
the previous vaccines against tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies .
the injections were to be repeated so frequently that the antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells with antibody factories .
professor crystal said that if the vaccine for human use was completely safe , there could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any nicotine addiction .
but it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit .
&quot; they know that if they start smoking again , they will take no pleasure because the vaccine cravings , and it could help them lose their bad habit , &quot; he added .
british scientists said the findings were interesting , but noted that much more research was needed .

&quot; an investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of the people who have come into contact with this kitten between october 8 and october 28 , &quot; said the ministries of health and agriculture .
&quot; five people who had been in contact with the kitten had already been identified &quot; and received a preventive treatment .
&quot; in humans , the preventive treatment of human rabies , administered after contact with the animal , but before the onset of symptoms , is very effective , &quot; said the release .
the ministries are now people who have been bitten , scratched , scratched , or on a worked-over mucosae or skin damaged by this kitten or that the animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 october to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 november .
&quot; france is free of rabies since 2001 , kitten or mother were imported from another country , not unscathed , &quot; according to the release .

an australian appealed against his sentence in thailand
a sydney woman , 21 , was sentenced to 15 days in jail in phuket for having falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver , has appealed the sentence and was released on bail .
stevie rochelle bamford was initially found guilty by a court in phuket province on june 15 , false statements after he told thai police that a local taxi driver , accompanied by two other men who had mastered , had assaulted early sunday , june 10 .
however , the video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her boyfriend , australian .
the phuket police interviewed bamford for two days before she admitted to having invented the story .
she was detained in a cell of the local police station before the court hearing .
bamford was sentenced to a prison term of 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of phuket , rather than in a prison for women .
this is the daughter of the former australian rugby league peter tunks , who has appealed to the ministry of foreign affairs in canberra to help her daughter .
tunks told the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; for the welfare of her daughter and wanted her to return to australia .
&quot; we obviously had a scary moment , but we hope it back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; tunks said .
bamford appealed the sentence and was released after paying a deposit of 50,000 baht .
in australia , the press said , meanwhile , she was on holiday in krabi , southern thailand .
thai judicial sources indicated that bamford was represented by a local lawyer in phuket , but warned that the call could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and a jail in an adult prison .
however , after the recent murder in phuket by michelle smith , an australian travel agent , thailand could also seek to burnish his image deteriorated from tourists , which could lead to an acquittal .
google , samsung and huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings for nortel patents
the group , which has thousands of former nortel patents has started an avalanche of patent lawsuits on thursday against the manufacturers of mobile phones , including google , the company he headed to the pole at the auction of patents that took place after the bankruptcy of nortel .
rockstar , the consortium which acquired nortel patents for $ 4.5 md , filed a complaint against samsung electronics co ltd , htc corp , huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the assize court of the united states in texas .
rockstar is owned jointly by apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is accused of violating seven patents .
patents for technologies that can display an advertising linked to search terms on the internet , said the outcome of the trial , which is the core business of google .
it was not possible to reach representatives of samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar .
samsung , huawei and htc producing phones that run on google &apos;s android operating system , which delivers a fierce competition with apple and microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 , google made an initial offer of $ 900 million for nortel &apos;s patents .
google has increased its offer several times , eventually proposing $ 4.4 million dinars .
after losing the nortel deal with rockstar , google has subsequently acquired motorola mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a market based in part on the library of motorola &apos;s patents .
&quot; despite having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue in the auction , google has infringed and continues to infringe patents , &quot; said the conclusions of the trial .
rockstar seeks damages and interests more important to google because he argues that google &apos;s patent infringement is tenacious , according to the complaint .
tripodi denies being influenced by obeid
the former new south wales labor minister joe tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the anti-corruption regulator of the state .
the former new south wales minister joe tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who had hidden interests in three properties located in the area controlled by the government .
on friday , the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) has expanded its investigation to determine whether mr obeid had lobbied several ministers of the state to renew its leases at circular quay , where obeid has two restaurants and a coffee , after their expiration in august 2005 , without a call for tender .
now it is investigating allegations that mr. tripodi was aware of the secret mr obeid &apos;s interest in these properties , following the testimony of the former deputy secretary general of mr. tripodi , lynne ashpole , on thursday .
during years of discussions initiated in 2005 , the government has pushed for the leases are a call for tender .
the tenants were against and also wanted more time .
in 2009 , the company leases from circular quay , which pertained to obeid about $ 2.5 million a year , were renewed without bidding .
mr. tripodi , who was minister of ports from february 2006 to november 2009 , was initially in favour of calls for tender .
but he denied having changed its policy at the request of mr. obeid , who has recognized mr. tripodi , called for a change of government policy on leases .
transcripts of telephone conversations at the icac showed calls made in august and september 2007 between mr obeid , mr tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who had arrived at the ministry of ports after having worked under the orders of obeid to the ministry of fisheries .
&quot; the subject discussed during these telephone conversations , it was the development of the policy on commercial leases ? &quot; asked assistant commissioner anthony whealy to mr. tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; replied mr. tripodi .
i don &apos;t remember what we discussed , but in any case , it was not that .
certainly not between me and mr obeid .
faa : airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft ( but not place a call using their mobile phone )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door-to-door to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music-but not speak on their mobile phone-under the new long-awaited guidelines published on thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect immediate changes .
the speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another , said the faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
the airlines will have to prove to the faa that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated training manuals of crew members and rules regarding the placement of the devices to be in compliance .
the faa said it had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes .
delta and jetblue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&quot; according to the plan , we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices in the very near future , &quot; the faa said in a statement .
currently , passengers must turn off their smartphones , tablets and other devices as soon as the plane &apos;s doors are closed .
they are not supposed to reignite them before the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and that the commander gives its green light .
the passengers are supposed to put their devices in the descent of the plane before landing and not restart them until the plane landed .
under the new guidelines , the airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs , landings and rolling on the ground , the faa said .
most of the new planes and other aircraft that were modified so that passengers can use the internet to higher altitudes , should meet the criteria .
laura glading , president of the association of professional flight attendants , said it was pleased with the changes .
&quot; once the new policy implementation in safety - and we will work in close collaboration with carriers for that-it will be beneficial to everyone , &quot; glading said in a statement .
we are frankly tired of us feel like &quot; supervisors &quot; when it comes to this issue .
but he will always be allowed to connect to the internet to surf , exchanging emails and sms or download data below 10,000 feet , the agency said .
passengers will have to put their smartphones , tablets and other devices in airplane mode .
still no words with friends , play online scrabble style in which the actor alec baldwin plays on his smartphone in 2011 when he was deported on an american airlines flight after he refused to turn off his camera while the plane was parked at the gate .
and the heavier devices like laptops will still be classified because it could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
the regulatory power of the phones is for the federal communications commission and not to the faa .
the faa can lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
last month , mark rosenker of the national transportation safety board , the national transportation safety board expert on cbs news , said that the phones were still seen as presenting a risk .
&quot; phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments , but because we know , according to the fcc , they could disrupt mobile phone masts if they are used on board , &quot; rosenker said .
an industry advisory committee , established by the faa to review the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices .
the pressure on the faa has increased in recent years to relax the restrictions on their use .
critics such as senator claire mccaskill , d-mo . ) , argue that there is no security reason for these bans .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become pervasive .
some studies suggest that at least a third of the passengers forget to turn off their appliances , or deliberately .
the faa has started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation instruments and communication when passengers carrying fm radios , the high-tech gadget .
the new jets , far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the faa .
the airlines allow passengers to use wi-fi to cruising altitudes for several years .
the aircraft modified for wi-fi systems also resistant to interference .
the vast majority of airliners should permit a wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of power far lower than previous generations .
readers of electronic books , for example , emit only minimum transmissions when turns a page .
but the signals are strongest when the devices to download or send data .
amazon.com is part of those who are pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by the passengers .
in 2011 , the company &apos;s leaders on an airliner electronic book reader kindle and flew them to see if there were problems , but there were none .
it has inspired the members of the advisory committee , the faa mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices present a risk .
douglas kidd , of the national association of airline passengers said that he thought that the interference from devices were real , even though the risk was minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with airplane systems , and that most of them are very old .
however , the board recommended that the faa allows drivers to ask passengers to turn off their devices for instrument landings in low visibility conditions .
a travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling the arrangements full of common sense for passengers equipped with technology .
&quot; we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a passenger experience pleasant is not incompatible with the security , &quot; said roger dow , president and chief executive of the u.s. travel association .
the rules on the use of electronic devices on board will remain for the time being in force in australia
the australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing , despite the u.s. gesture to relax rules on electronic devices .
the american federal aviation administration left the door open to u.s. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they are in &quot; airplane mode . &quot;
passengers can already do so during most of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing .
australian carriers to examine the decision that requires u.s. carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements , but said they have no immediate intention to change their procedures .
the civil aviation safety authority also said it considered the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight was still in force in australia .
&quot; casa has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in the plane , &quot; she said .
the issue is the subject of a regulation that requires operators of aircraft to ensure the maintenance of security at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
virgin , which has already spoken to the house of his intention to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using wi-fi technology , was open to a change , but said it would follow the governor .
&quot; we would welcome a review by casa , which allows the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have ( the onboard entertainment system using wi-fi technology on our aircraft , &quot; said a spokesman .
qantas said it was at the moment the current rules .
&quot; according to our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing , and we have no immediate intention to change it , &quot; she said .
the faa &apos;s decision applies to american airlines .
however , we are always interested by the regulatory changes that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the faa &apos;s decision and the reasons for it .
for u.s. carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet .
the carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as review the manuals , training materials , transport programme of hand luggage and the instructions provided to passengers .
&quot; as soon as an airline has tested the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable electronic devices , such as tablets , electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes , &quot; the faa said .
in the rare case of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to turn off their appliances during the landing .
the group also recommended that heavier equipment stowed safely under the seats or in the overhead bins during take-off and landing .
the cdc publishes tips on allergies in children to schools
on wednesday , the united states centers for disease control and prevention issued a set of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in children to school .
this is the first set of guidelines that the american government is publishing , since the number of school-age children with food allergies has climbed sharply .
one in 20 children in the united states now suffers from a food allergy .
the cdc found that the prevalence of food allergies among children had increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children , and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction .
he also recommends to schools to have a stock of epinephrine auto-injector epipen brand - is the most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis .
the state legislatures have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have more easily of epinephrine in stock .
the report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction .
children can say , &quot; i have the impression that something irritates me the language , &quot; &quot; i feel like i have a hair on the language &quot; or &quot; i have a tingling sensation on the tongue . &quot;
many opposed to medical help to die in congress of palliative care
the canadian congress of palliative care , which takes place this week in ottawa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical help to die in quebec .
this is an opportunity for several associations of palliative care to reaffirm their disagreement .
if all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering , in addition to being able to stay home , very few of them would want to end their lives , according to a spokesman for the canadian association of palliative care , maryse bouvette ..
emphasis on palliative care in canada , the approach of euthanasia would be minimal .
the president of the palliative care network of quebec also rejects the draft law on medical help to die .
if it is adopted , alberte d√©ry is concerned about the consequences for future generations .
&quot; what is the meaning of life , &quot; she lamented .
the majority of the houses of palliative care will refuse to help patients die , according to the vice-president of the alliance of palliative care homes , suzanne fitzback ..
ms fitzback , also director of la maison mathieu-froment-savoie in gatineau , believes that the service would be useless anyway .
we will never request : &quot; i want to die , give me an injection . &quot;
the director of the palliative care association of ontario , rick firth , believes that the draft law of quebec misleads people about the vocation of palliative care .
he does not believe that ontario will follow .
for its part , the liberal member of parliament for gatineau , stephanie valley , argues that the notion of the end of life will have to be clarified before the draft law is adopted .

finally , talking of pumpkins .
charlie brown gave us the big pumpkin when we were kids , and carve a pumpkin lantern , it &apos;s like decorating a christmas tree-it is something one does , since it is very small .
fortunately for us , the &quot; tendency of b√©b√©-citrouille &quot; began only last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us have carved the pumpkins and has not had to sit inside .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million in pumpkins , according to the u.s. census bureau .
the citrouilles-lanternes which wilt gently on the porch of the house , presumably from illinois , where 542 million pumpkins have been cultivated this year .
if you are looking to you to point out more , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california , and try to carve their pumpkin 922 kg .
school transport : the admissible complaints
the school board of the r√©gion-de-sherbrooke ( csrs ) calls since the beginning of the school year for a fee of $ 150 per student ( up to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for students benefiting from school transportation for two residences , a service that the organization offers when she is able to do so .
before the changes in the last budget , no financial contribution was claimed .
&quot; there is a service of mediation , which is proposed by the commission and i was interested , &quot; explains ms. lefevre .
according to her , the csrs was invited to a mediation and requested additional time to consider it .
&quot; it is always better to talk , to work together and find solutions , &quot; lefevre said .
the school board of the r√©gion-de-sherbrooke ( csrs ) did not want to comment .
the organization has only meant that the mediation is part of the process in a complaint .
congo : the military attack on the last rebel stronghold
diehard fans of the 23 million , representing a few hundred fighters , were severed nearly 2000 metres altitude on the farm hills in runyonyi and chanzu , mbuzi , relatives of bunagana and jomba , about 80 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province .
&quot; it hasn &apos;t stopped since this morning , the fighting continues despite the night &quot; , told afp a resident of jomba , reached by telephone around 12 : 30 , and according to which a young girl was injured by gunfire in the morning .
&quot; the intensity of clashes has dropped a bit , &quot; he added , &quot; it seems that the fardc armed forces repelled a rebel . &quot;
according to this witness , who wished to remain anonymous , the soldiers had &quot; spent the night &quot; in jomba before climbing to the front for a &quot; sweep operation &quot; .
it was very much behind him crackling fed small arms .
in bunagana , political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebels fell on wednesday , an afp reporter could hear heavy weapons detonations .
according to a source at the un mission for the stabilization of the drc , the fighting came &quot; in a final phase , &quot; the fardc &quot; surrounded the remaining 23 positions to dislodge them . &quot;
since the resumption , on friday , clashes between the movement of march 23 ( 23 ) and the military , the monusco is not directly involved in the fighting , but it provides a crucial support to government troops in intelligence , planning and observation .
at the end of the afternoon , dozens of soldiers , well supplied with ammunition , rode at the front line .
they were armed with kalashnikovs and rocket launchers .
earlier , on the road leading to bunagana border post with uganda , the military helped ago13 civilians a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck of fardc , to ensure the succession of another spacecraft pounding 23 positions on the hills .
the congolese president , joseph kabila , on wednesday evening , called again on the rebels to &quot; demobilize voluntarily or be disarmed by force , &quot; but left open the process from kampala , kinshasa and the m23 discuss since december without results for the moment .
on the spot , the political leaders of the m 23 hoping to reach an agreement .
&quot; we ended the talks , it only remains for the mediation of uganda to organize the signature , &quot; said roger lumbala , vice-president of the delegation of 23 million , but that information could be immediately confirmed by the government side .
the m23 is born of a mutiny in april 2012 , former rebels , mostly tutsi , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
the un and kinshasa regularly accused rwanda and uganda of supporting the m23 , which kigali and kampala deny .
the north is one of the most densely populated regions of the drc , and a basement full of mineral resources .
at bunagana , on the ugandan side of the border , where they had taken refuge about 5000 people between monday and wednesday , according to the un , the movement back to the drc that had begun in the morning , reversed at midday .
&quot; this morning we crossed to go in our fields , but the soldiers told us to retreat , &quot; said imelda nyirankusi , surrounded by his nine children , including an infant on her back .
one has the impression that the shooting is closer to the people .
at the beginning of the evening , dozens of people crossing the border , some with a mattress on his head , to spend the night in uganda .
the israeli army killed a member of hamas to gaza-sces
israeli tank fire killed on thursday a palestinian militant islamist hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the gaza strip , it was reported , according to sources of health services .
a source close to hamas said fighting erupted in this region , because israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by palestinian mortar fire .
the israeli army is merely a &quot; targeted action &quot; in the area near a tunnel described as &quot; terrorist &quot; by the jewish state , dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid october .
the concern for security in mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful figures
at the foot of the statue of founding president , samora machel of mozambique , to laugh at them , thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo to chanting peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace , we want stability , &quot; said vanessa de sousa , general manager of an investment company .
concern for the future of her country , she shared her work clothes against a t-shirt bearing the words &quot; we want security &quot; in portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on independence square in the capital on thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and renamo , the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years .
the rebel movement renamo was once a famous , initially supported by rhodesia governed by white and then the apartheid government of south africa in the framework of efforts to destabilize the country &apos;s independent government .
after a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it has become an opposition party .
the analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict , but recent events have shaken the foreign investors and the local population .
the stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than 50 billion investment over the next few years from companies such as rio tinto , vale of brazil , italy &apos;s eni and anadarko of the united states .
frelimo , the ruling party and the main political force since 1975 , and renamo blame each other tensions .
renamo says that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack against its members in sofala province , a traditional stronghold of the renamo , on 17 october .
the assault on the former rebels then erupted when government forces attacked the renamo bases and attempted to kill afonso dhlakama , the leader of the group , and fernando mazanga , the spokesman for renamo , according to the financial times .
the government makes the renamo leader to have triggered the conflicts , and accuses him of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability .
mr guebuza said on wednesday the afp , the french news agency , that mr dhlakama is regarded as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; all forces that he was still trying to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government . &quot;
frelimo and renamo insist that they both want to avoid war .
but the concern grew after mr. mazanga said renamo was abandoning the peace agreement of 1992 .
he told the ft that he meant that the accord was not respected by frelimo .
&quot; we want to resume negotiations , but with the utmost seriousness , &quot; mr mazanga said .
previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year .
&quot; these are two great men ( guebuza and frelimo ) who do not stop to argue , &quot; said joseph hanlon , a lecturer at the open university and an expert on mozambique .
none of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , which is in favour of electoral reform , had already said that it will boycott the municipal elections to be held in november .
the presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt to move a patient to obtain concessions and a war chest from the government .
the share of votes collected by renamo steady decline since 1992 , while a new party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) , which was created by a former member of renamo , should get a larger number of votes in the elections .
mr. mazanga said that mr guebuza - who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year-wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&quot; he does not want a multi-party democracy , it does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; mr. mazanga said .
it is not clear what is the ability of the renamo , but she led disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway .
most of the clashes took place in the province of sofala , which is located several hundred miles north of maputo , beira , but where is the port where mining companies , including rio tinto and vale , exporting coal .
in june , rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after renamo threatened to attack the rail line .
mr. mazanga was falsely shy when asked if renamo would reiterate this threat .
renamo wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things are not going well in mozambique , &quot; mr mazanga said .
the instability has strengthened the frustrations with the government , said fernando lima , head of mediacoop , an independent media company , many people are also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings .
&quot; people think that the future of the country are the government and the president , and that is to find solutions to problems , &quot; he explained .
omar sultuane , a protester , said that people only wanted stability .
&quot; nobody cares about the renamo nor frelimo , they just want peace , they want to have a free access to the roads , &quot; he added .

aaron hudgins , aged 30 , was arrested on friday morning following searches at his home and in the office of the national research council where he works .
the timberlay baptist church , where the pastor gave , says he is deeply saddened by this news .
in a statement , the church leaders indicate that mr. hudgins resigned his position .

coulson has used the telephone hacking to verify a pipe
the former editor of news of the world , andy coulson had used &quot; the phone hacking , surveillance and the confrontation &quot; trying to confirm a phony pipe on a route involving the interior minister , charles clarke .
prosecutor andrew edis qc told the old bailey court that the news of the world had heard a false rumour in may 2005 that clarke had a relationship with hannah pawlby , her &quot; pretty special adviser . &quot;
it was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned glenn mulcaire , a private detective to hack the voicemail of pawlby and &quot; planted permanently in front of her door &quot; , but coulson also called and left voice messages .
&quot; the prosecution suggest that mr coulson , who is now the editor of notw , is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house people hoping to surprise them , it is the kind of man to love the story to people to see what they have to say , &quot; mr. edis said .
he said that notw used three methods to investigate topics : the phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation .
the editor is personally involved in the third .
it is clear that he is aware of the second , surveillance , it cannot be otherwise .
but what about the first ?
he is aware of the phone hacking ?
he claims the opposite , but we say &quot; of course . &quot;
the rumors about an affair involving clarke were taken first by the editorial office of notw when a source , experiencing a sexual attraction to miss pawlby , said he had been told : &quot; do not lose your time with her , she is with charles . &quot;
a band , which recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times , was seized at the home of mulcaire in august 2006 .
the investigators also found on the computer seized from the private detective that miss pawlby and his sister in a record &quot; projects . &quot;
during the period when the detective has investigated it , grandparents of miss pawlby received anonymous calls when asked for information about her , &quot; said edis .
meanwhile , former chief reporter neville thurlbeck and former reporter james weatherup oversaw the monitoring of movements of miss pawlby ..
in a voicemail message he left him on 18 june 2005 , coulson said : &quot; i have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow that i would really like to talk to charles . &quot;
mr edis explained that the involvement of coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former interior minister david blunkett .
the jury heard on thursday that coulson had confronted mr blunkett on a liaison with a married woman while he was attending the co-d√©fenderesse rebekah brooks , who was also married at the time .
coulson and brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between october 3 2000 and august 9 , 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup admitted to having carried out of the phone hacking .
bailout plan of $ 325 million for tasmania &apos;s health system
the federal government maintains that the bailout plan of $ 325 million for the ailing health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state funds are not wasted .
federal health minister tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth was taking &quot; urgent measures &quot; to end a crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island state , the high rates of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
the financing , expected over four years , was decided after government consultations with tasmanian independent mp andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has proposed an emergency bailout plan that we believe will solve the unique challenges the state faces , &quot; ms plibersek said today .
the $ 325 million includes a $ 31 million campaign for elective surgery .
2,600 additional operations , especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract , will help to reduce the backlog .
funds are also earmarked for walk-in clinics in hobart and launceston , better care , the training of medical , mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments will respond to the idea that , according to front-line clinicians , this is the best way to treat the health system of tasmania , &quot; ms plibersek said .
the minister said the tasmanian government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability .
the state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where we spend the extra funds .
a commission composed of three people will be established to ensure that the state provides the most effective and efficient way possible .
mr wilkie said today that the $ 325 million will not count for much , &quot; unless they are followed by a real reform to strengthen the public health system of tasmania . &quot;
however , he commended the government for having responded to the request for emergency help to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i hope that the federal aid plan will contribute significantly to the public health system of tasmania from the black list , &quot; said mr wilkie .
according to the state government , these additional emergency procedures to reverse much of the recent cuts .
but the spokesman for the opposition health peter dutton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; a makeshift solution . &quot;
&quot; the reason why we are here is that the labour government of the state withdrew $ 430 million of its health care system , &quot; he said on abc tv .
we cannot have a state government that snatches nearly half a billion dollars and the commonwealth , which is $ 300 million , and claim that it is a good day .
mr. dutton visited ms plibersek to ensure that each dollar of bailout plan will not be spent on additional bureaucracy .

dr. georges bwelle provides free health care in the villages of cameroon
dr. bwelle and his team spend almost all of their weekends to see hundreds of patients
there are not many doctors in this west african nation , barely 1 in 5,000 inhabitants .
vote here or via your mobile device
dr. georges bwelle is one of 10 cnn hero of the year 2013 .
you can vote for him , or one of the other 10 heroes , to elect &quot; cnn hero of the year . &quot;
this person will receive $ 250,000 for his extraordinary work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle watched his ill father alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
jamef bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near yaounde , the capital of cameroon .
at the beginning , he had a broken arm , but he contracted an infection that had spread to his brain , creating a hematoma that he would bear the consequences for the rest of his life .
&quot; there was no neurosurgeons in cameroon , &quot; said georges bwelle ..
we would have taken abroad if we had enough money .
instead , dr. bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded hospitals and clinics , for any treatment he could benefit .
&quot; it is not easy , &quot; adds mr. bwelle ..
you can leave the house at 5 a.m. , you rush to the hospital for the first , and you &apos;re not the first .
there are many patients .
people can die because they wait too long .
the situation has not changed much since the death of the father of dr. bwelle in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants , according to the world health organization .
by comparison , the u.s. ratio is one doctor for 413 people .
and even if they could see a doctor , many cameroonians could not pay for the consultation .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditure in the private sector .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; explained dr. bwelle ..
and because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
after seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer , dr. bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things .
dr. georges bwelle and her team of volunteers had performed more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year .
he became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in yaounde .
and he created a non-profit humanitarian association , ascovime , who travels to rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday , with some 30 people , they huddle in vans after the medical equipment on the roof and going through difficult terrain to the villages that need the most help .
the luck does not always follow them .
they have repeatedly had to push vehicles through rivers or muddy tracks .
but when they arrive , they are received as a hero : the community organizes a party , sings and dances and offers them the best available housing .
in these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and dr. bwelle-with his big smile and boundless energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities .
the next morning , the team starts to receive hundreds of patients .
&quot; we get 500 people at each visit , &quot; mr. bwelle said .
they can live to 60 km from the village , and they come on foot .
in this mobile hospital , various health care is provided .
many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , sexually transmitted diseases and pests .
others may receive crutches , collected a pair of glasses or a birth certificate free-document needed to attend school , but many poor families simply can &apos;t afford to buy it .
in the evening , the team practice of simple surgery under local anaesthesia .
the operations are usually performed in a school , a town hall or a house ; after the surgery , the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave room for the next person .
thanks to the lighting of the generator , the operating theatre and the sterilization of equipment , dr. bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of sunday morning .
it &apos;s a grueling pace , but the musicians village to help the team to stay motivated .
&quot; they beat on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work , &quot; explained mr bwelle ..
on sunday , the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work she has done .
the group , composed of cameroonian doctors and medical students , has practiced 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year , and he knows that their presence can make all the difference to those who are helped .
a man explained that the free operation he underwent to treat a hernia would allow him to work again .
&quot; it will change my future and that of my family , &quot; said the man .
in addition to this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital , dr. bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around yaound√© .
this is the second job , he explains , which funds 60 % its association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; i don &apos;t know when he sleeps , &quot; said katie o &apos;malley , a medical student in the second year of the drexel university in philadelphia and a volunteer group of dr. bwelle .
he is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to conduct these campaigns .
for medical students and nursing students like katie o &apos;malley , who came from the united states and europe to join mr. bwelle in its missions , it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they were not at home .
&quot; one was able to participate in operations to help stanch the blood or get dr. bwelle instruments , &quot; explained ms. o &apos;malley .
it is not something that you have the opportunity to do in america when you &apos;re a medical student in the second year .
student volunteers typically pay their travel to cameroon , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
but once in yaound√© , their pensions , their transport and education are being cared for by dr. bwelle ..
&quot; he is a hero , there is no doubt , &quot; said katie o &apos;malley .
he gave his life for this association , and his desire to help the people of cameroon is not about to be extinguished .
for dr. bwelle , the workload of relatively constant is not a problem .
helping others to live happily with the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; i &apos;m so happy when i do this work , &quot; added mr bwelle ..
and i think of my father .
i hope he sees what i &apos;m doing .
making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that lead me to do that .

both france &apos;s pierre nora
perplexed , academics have long struggled to identify and locate pierre nora .
professor in the lecture halls and classrooms ?
without a doubt , but by emphasizing its low for the traverse , sciences-po , hautes etudes .
arbitrator of the works of others in her office on the street gaston-gallimard ?
in fact , but ignoring the work hidden underground and writing from the publisher .
heir to the armchair fontenelle occupied at the french academy ?
certainly , but knowing that such a rite cannot replace the real holy oil , the thesis , that it happened .
they readily acknowledged him as a major champion , host and for their work , but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce it himself .
has this image uncertain the monument &quot; sites of memory , &quot; to which he attached his name , also contributed .
the nasty languages were able to see a giant flea market , presented by an intelligent commentator with a keen glance and weighted with scholarship , but hopelessly dilettante .
the two books published by nora here almost two years ago have already established that anyone who was not writing were many and well written .
the book here should make him permanently .
there are , however , once more , the temptation of ubiquity , casual / promiscuous intellectual , the jubilation last jump as feet from one subject to another .
but it soon becomes apparent that the disparate objects collected in this book so as to reduce the junk at one and the same passion : discover the constitutive node of the french identity .
why these dramatic appeals to national unity ?
identity : it is a concern .
recently , we have collectively been invited to give a definition .
but in the minds of our leaders , the french identity was a timeless essence .
it was only in the accidents , and the matter requires jacobinism , was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects , authorized interpreters .
that stalking pierre nora is quite another .
it is not an heir to an eternal francit√© , he refuses to the definition .
analyst worried a familiar strangeness , wandering in a forest of symbols , at each step by an object in the shape of rory r√©bus , irritating questions .
including this one , which comes from the company itself : why , in a country so permanently installed at its borders , if formerly big-boned and bridge-of-castle firmly , what these dramatic calls to unit ?
they are so pressing , suggests pierre nora , to avert the disorder born discord of french history .
frank and gauls , armagnacs and burgundian , catholics and protestants : the forces of division , here are very old .
and the most famous , of course , is the one that splits into two national history .
after the earthquake , the french revolution two stories and they have two nations , one catholic , the other revolutionary .
the second was the death of the first , but without reaching the deny ; on the contrary , in the sacredness and all the more eager of unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head of anyone who was the obvious and powerful incarnation .
and , from there , a nation solidly binary , split between left and right , secular and catholicism , adoration and hatred of the revolution .
to feel this singularity of french identity , nothing beats the four not out of l &apos;hexagone , so the american getaway of pierre nora could well be the heart of his book .
because america and france have one and the other is a revolution , drafted a bill of rights , wanted to start a new company .
but the american parentage is only better highlight what is unique to us .
there , men who had left their former regime in england and had more to worry about .
here , men crowded an ancient indigenous regime , and all the more dramatic .
a consensual revolution when here it has sown the drama and conflict .
the founding fathers always honoured , and here the revolutionary ancestors who were struggling to make models , and the rest fought .
an institutional constancy , and by a cascade of constitutions , as mistakes catch up and trials to resume .
france , which is at stake , france which has just
but there was a time when the french thought able to reattach the torn dress in their history and overcome the curse of both .
the third republic , central time and creator , pierre nora has shown great interest and even tenderness : welcoming those who are employed to repair the revolutionary divide , by teaching schoolchildren all that in old france preparing obscurely modern france and offering them a unified version of their story .
but this peaceful identity had only one time .
here she is again in the debate , pushed by a new immigration , threatened by the rise of industrial minorities , absorbed in the european space .
the book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of france is at stake and the careful outline of france .
with the portrait of the historian , who should reserve a few surprises .
it discovered that it was a homelover chemineau .
the man many curiosities , slightly obsessive revolved around a single idea .
the prowler edges stood at the center of the center .
and that , more than half a century , a story about the idea of a nation , but had evaded the initiatic exercise of the thesis , gives us , cum grano salis , that it will eventually make it .
certainly in a form less stiff , more fragmented and more subtle .
but make no mistake , just as binding .
because far more than is required of the university curriculum , this th√®se-ci told the inner need of a life .
how biometrics will invade our lives
eventually the passwords to enter to access his smartphone or make purchases ?
u.s. researchers , french or japanese , we predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors , telephones and computers .
bernard didier , deputy director general of morpho , believes that &quot; the biometric century will be . &quot;
only the biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe transverse and transnational as well as the internet .
organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics , but troubled .
anything that in 2011 and in france , the national commission on information technology and freedoms allowed 774 fingerprint recognition systems , hand or venous network of hand in business , government , canteens ...
&quot; everyone can soon be identified , anywhere and anytime , &quot; is saddened by justin brookman , head of consumer privacy in the cdt ( center for democracy and technology in washington .
the reasons for such optimism , among some , and pessimism , among others ?
biometrics will rely on new technologies , which will enable new services to citizens and consumers .
today , in france , the biometric data are most often used fingerprints , the outline of the hand and the venous system of the palm or finger .
but each of these techniques has its constraints .
&quot; for example , some people who work on concrete fingers very damaged and their fingerprints are unreadable , &quot; philippe robin , technical director of thales communications identity &amp; security .
and the collection and verification of the venous network and the outline of the hand involves a voluntary gesture and precise .
it is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback : the procedure must be repeated and sometimes it takes time .
therefore , research is conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches , such as facial recognition or iris ( the colored part of the eye ) .
thanks to the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and computing capability of computers to analyse data , these techniques become operational .
the accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years , calculates cyrille bataller , director of the r &amp; d labs of accenture in europe .
with our help , the united kingdom and the netherlands have made automatic border using facial recognition .
it is now possible to identify a face or iris .
&quot; today , we are conducting research on voice recognition or the manner of walking with the help of sound sensors , but it is a silent environment , &quot; says sridhar iyengar , director of security research at intel labs .
single marker and tamper-free , dna also raises hopes and concerns .
&quot; in the current state of knowledge , it can be seen as the ultimate biometric data , &quot; confirms sophie vulliet-tavernier , director of education , innovation and foresight to the cnil .
but dna analysis is still very long and very expensive .
nec offers the services of the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze dna samples from the crime scene and in an hour .
the use of biometrics are divided into two groups : the identification ( to recognize a person among others ) and e-authentication ( to ensure that the person is who he or she purports to be ) .
the identification was so far the issuance of identity : we must confront the biometrics ( fingerprints , iris ) with the information the state has on all citizens already on file .
this ensures that a person is not trying to steal someone else &apos;s identity .
this principle of comparison can have other applications .
nec offers recognition of vips at the entrance of a hotel or a store .
&quot; we get the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them with photos of celebrities who move freely over the internet , &quot; explains dany nassif , nec , france , business development for biometric identification solutions .
another use : take a photo of a down-and-out who lined up in a store , follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the wait times .
e-authentication initially involved physical access ( borders , secure facilities , canteens ... ) or logiques ( opening of a computer ) .
there is added , more recently , the control of presence .
&quot; a biometric staffand avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that points to another , &quot; justifies cyrille bataller , accenture .
but , increasingly , authentication will also involve transactions , especially those made from devices connected to the internet .
in japan , it is already possible to withdraw money to certain distributors by introducing his card and hand over a biometric reader : it replaces the knock of the secret code .
a similar technique is tested in villeneuve- d &apos;ascq and d &apos;angoul√™me by natural security company in partnership with banks and signs of mass distribution : when to pay at the store with her credit card , the customer doesn &apos;t pare its code , but introduces his finger in a reader that scans the veins .
the trial is scheduled to last for six months .
if it is successful , the biometric readers could soon reach the french traders .
to reassure users
there are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public .
the first is to explain that she can save time .
&quot; if , through biometrics , a client remains in unjspf thirty seconds of less , it is significant , &quot; explains the director of a large surface .
the second is to offer personalized services : in a few years , a voice server will recognize your voice and you propose options .
and , finally , reassured by the precautions taken to protect databases .
&quot; the fingerprints are stored on a server ; the identities of the people are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing , which is trying to block the move , &quot; lists philippe robin , thales .
but , in the absence of comprehensive studies , it is impossible to know whether the speech really convince users .
the specialists of the protection of privacy , they are still worried .
&quot; the progress of the facial recognition , the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of available photos on facebook , flickr or picasa , makes me fear the worst : a blanket surveillance &quot; , predicts andrew patrick , the office of privacy protection in canada .
frontier airlines plans to charge for carry-on luggage
frontier airlines plans to pay up to $ 100 on passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights .
frontier airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carry-on baggage and $ 2 for a cup of coffee or soda , although in its announcement on wednesday , it reported that the passengers could not open the can carry with them on the descent of the plane .
the new hand luggage bags are stowed in the overhead compartment , so the small bags installed under the seat will still be free .
frontier said it would pay $ 25 if the fees were paid in advance and $ 100 if passengers paid only once at the gate .
the spokesman for frontier , kate o &apos;malley said that $ 100 was provided to encourage passengers to pay the fee in advance .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to pay the price , &quot; she explained .
the airlines started charging for first and second checked bags in 2008 .
passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were as much as they could in carry-on luggage stowed in overhead bins , and there was often more prominently in these compartments .
these costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board .
o &apos;malley said that these new fees will not be used to raise money .
this is to impress upon frontier &apos;s most loyal customers as it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the overhead bins .
passengers who buy their tickets on the airline company will not have to pay .
for example , a passenger waiting for a gate frontier could carry a bag for free , while the person next in the queue would have to pay $ 100 for a similar bag .
o &apos; malley explained that the site and the procedures for the registration of frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before arriving at the door .
the hand luggage of frontier will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other costs , but the airlines love them .
they believe that the costs of baggage handling are important and that passengers who want this service should pay .
many people on wall street believe the addition of baggage fees as a sign that proves that the airlines have to pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
but many of them do not have hit the baggage fees .
spirit airlines inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago , and the low-cost carrier allegiant has followed a little later .
the only other company imposing such fees is the hungarian airline wizz air , said the airline consultant jay sorensen , who closely follows the costs extra .
he estimated in a report in december 2011 , the hand luggage of spirit were $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , a former midwest airlines , recently travelled on spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when the passengers will discover the unusual hand baggage fees charged by the company .
&quot; i had never seen a boarding procedure as fluid in my entire career , &quot; he said .
i expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door .
the plane was full , he added , &quot; the passengers boarded at lightning speed . &quot;
frontier also like spirit and charges $ 2 for a coffee , tea , soda or fruit juice .
frontier said that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can carry the cannot open with them , and those who take coffee can be recycled for free .
it will distribute free water .
us airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained , and when no other major airline had followed .
the frontier &apos;s decision to charge for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is his latest effort to encourage customers to move on its website .
the airlines are paying to the online travel sellers such as orbitz , $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
this prompted airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than go to an online travel agency .
however , frontier has gone further in this area .
in september , it began to offer only half of frequent flyer miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , it reduced the bonus miles by 25 % on a trip .
thus , a frontier of travel 1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles .
it also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket on the frontier .
frontier has a loyal clientele in its home city , denver , but its activity is declining and it is losing money .
revenues fell by 9 % and flight capacity declined by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to financial results published on wednesday by its parent company , republic airways holdings inc ..
republic attempted to adjust the frontier &apos;s finances by selling the airline .
scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood .
previous studies had found that the dogs happy shuffled their tails more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs the shuffled over to the left .
but now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to it .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the university of trento , said : &quot; everyone knows that , in humans , the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here , we tried to see what it was in other species .
he added that as well as humans , dogs on the right side of the brain was in charge of the movement to the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions .
for more information on how the dogs react to the movement of a disorderly queue of other dogs , the researchers followed animals watching movies containing other dogs .
they measured heart rate and analysed their behaviour .
we must certainly not long before we understand why their tails sometimes goes on the one hand , and sometimes from the other .
professor vallortigara explained : &quot; we presented to dogs films containing other dogs - a naturalistic version is a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors - and we were able to fix the movement of the tail , and present it as going to the left or to the right . &quot;
when the animals were given a dog without a tail is wagging the expression to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that wags her tail ) , they remained perfectly relaxed .
but when they spotted a tail mainly deflected to the left ( again from the point of view of the dog that wags her tail ) , their heart rate has accelerated , and they looked anxious .
professor vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate them thanks to these movements .
instead , he believes the dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry .
he added : &quot; if you meet several times with other dogs , and if you notice , most of the time , the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude , you &apos;re depending on this experience . &quot;
the researchers suggest that the results could lead to owners , veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals .
the canine behaviour expert john bradshaw , visiting professor at the school of veterinary sciences at the university of bristol , said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of both the left and the right in the canine species .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln found that the dogs turned his head to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog and right when he was a happy dog .
and in another scientific study by the university of victoria in canada , he said : &quot; the dogs were more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right , instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is contained in the italian study . &quot;
he said that the differences could be that the dogs involved in the various studies did not consider fully the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs .
a study on how the dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
&quot; while many elements , among different mammals , indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
however , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will surely not long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on the one hand and sometimes on the other .

live together in french , the challenge of the marguerite-bourgeoys school
the marguerite-bourgeoys school board , 62 % of students have a language other than french .
that is why , a year ago , a consultation with parents , students , teachers and staff members of the education , to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live in several cultures .
the school board has just unveiled its vision of &quot; living together in french . &quot;
the diversity vision wanders from one year in schools to help students of all backgrounds to discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the french language .
the discovery of quarters , our architecture , our places are like signposts .
the big names of writers , artists , whether they are or whether they are from elsewhere .
who are our builders ?
&quot; so , we create projects so that they identify with it , &quot; explains the president of vision , a√Øda kamar diversity .
michel venne , of the institute of the new world , identified several challenges for the school board .
&quot; the transmission , for example , what is the quebec culture , the sense of belonging , support staff , changes in the student , &quot; he lists .
the marguerite-bourgeoys school has created a research center that will provide tools for teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere .
rachida azdouz , of the university of montreal , will be the scientific director .
preparing to manage a class in a north american context , quebec .
&quot; different teaching strategies , that is the real need , &quot; she summed up .
the research will focus on the inclusion in all its aspects : linguistic , educational , social and cultural development .
obama puts end to eavesdropping on the imf and the world bank
barack obama has ordered the national security agency ( nsa ) to put an end to her tapping on the international monetary fund and the world bank in the framework of its intelligence activities , said an american official , on thursday .
this decision is part of the attempt by the white house to take a hand in the matter of the nsa &apos;s eavesdropping after the revelations made by the former analyst edward snowden , a refugee in russia .
it is the first time that the imf and the world bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal .
asked about the matter , an official of the american administration replied : &quot; the united states does not conduct electronic surveillance to the headquarters of the world bank and the imf in washington . &quot;
speaking anonymously , the official did not specify if such monitoring was in place in the past .
another official , he said that barack obama had instructed to cease these practices during the past weeks .
this instruction was given at about the same time as putting an end to eavesdropping on the un headquarters in new york .
in this context , the senate intelligence committee approved on thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but allowed their prosecution .
the commission introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are permitted to collect and imposed a five-year limit for maintaining this information .
european stock exchanges fell at the half-way point , except london
with the exception of london , the main european stock markets move lower on friday at the midway point , sealed by some disappointing corporate news , while wall-street is expected to rise .
moreover , investors remain cautious because they believe that the u.s. federal reserve may unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected .
on the other hand , after the announcement of an inflation to 0.7 % for the whole of the eurozone , the idea is spreading among market players that the european central bank ( ecb ) could relax its monetary policy .
the future of wall street suggests an opening of us equities rise after two consecutive sessions of decline .
the values , renault ( -4,63 % ) recorded the highest decline in the cac 40 , crippled by the warning on the outcome of its partner nissan motor on friday .
royal bank of scotland ( -6,26 % ) marks the worst performance of the rein complacency , after also published results down this morning and announced the creation of an in-house hiving-off structure ( &quot; bad bank &quot; ) with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets .
for its part , vodafone ( + 2,45 % ) remains at the top of the increases to rein complacency in response to a press information that at &amp; t is studying a possible takeover bid .
on the foreign exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the ecb &apos;s monetary policy , as evidenced by john hardy , strategist at saxo bank .
the mandate of the ecb has always focused on inflation , so mario draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
we look forward to a potential decline in the euro .
in this context , the euro continued to fall against the us dollar and hit a session low of two weeks 1,3517 dollar .
these same conjecture argue the opposite the bond market in the eurozone .
this means that a law adopted in july in the state and significantly on the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
the classic song for adolescents
each time , it is the school that will be targeted , an initiative that had experienced much success during the previous season .
through five sketches designed and interpreted by artists from the region , with a large dose of humor , allows adolescents to tame the classic song .
in addition to the show , the opera company of the kingdom will return with its lyrical destinations , a formula that is now standing room only at la pulperie in chicoutimi .
two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014 , which gives the opportunity for local artists to show what they are capable of .
in these activities is added the lyric ap√©ro , benefit concert held last august , with the assistance of the coloratura soprano marie-√®ve munger .
it was a fundraiser , parallel to the artistic dimension , and it helped the not-for-profit organization to produce a balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as an air of a bat .
without precise figures , the chairman of the board of directors , yves bergeron , took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in chicoutimi , to be reassuring .
despite the uncertainty that is the lot of so many cultural institutions , the future is good , even in the long run .
we support more solid and consistent .
&quot; finance is alive and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta , a milestone that will take in seven years , &quot; said the administrator .
&quot; i would even go beyond that , &quot; added the director general , h√©l√®ne gaudreault , smiling .
the congolese army is chasing the rebels of m 23
the congolese army ( fardc ) announced on thursday that its units were chasing the rebels of m 23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of north kivu , which borders rwanda and uganda .
the 23 appears to be beaten after being chased from villages in the northeast of the democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) that he controlled from the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insurgency .
&quot; we will continue the m 23 and drive it wherever it is hiding because they are criminals , &quot; said reuters colonel olivier hamuli , a spokesman of the fardc .
we must not allow them to reorganize themselves because they ball the congolese people for too long .
the time has come to bring peace .
officials of the m 23 explained to have evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and bertrand bissimwa , political leader of the rebellion , said on rfi that these military setbacks commits to its claims to the peace talks .
the latter , according to the ugandan mediators , resumed on wednesday in kampala between the kinshasa government and the m23 .
clashes are reported in the hills that dominate bunagana , the last town in the hands of insurgents to be dropped this week , and in the vicinity of runyoni , a hill where the m23 rebellion began in 2012 .
at their peak in november , the insurgents have occupied goma , capital of north kivu province , taking advantage of the flight of the garrison and the passivity of the monusco peacekeepers .
the fall of goma has led the un mission in the drc , the largest in the world in terms of staffing , to strengthen its mandate and to create a rapid intervention brigade made up of south african , tanzanian and malawian soldiers .
for its part , the staff of the fardc has been redesigned and the military has gone on the offensive against the m23 , change the course of the war .
the pace of government troops today is unprecedented .
&quot; the 23 million seems to be coming to an end , &quot; predicts one expert in congolese affairs , jason stearns , a congo siasa blog .
it would be history-it would be the first time that the kinshasa government manages to beat a major insurgency .
and it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to rwanda would be present in the eastern drc .
un experts accuse rwanda , who vehemently denies supporting militarily the m 23 , initially set up by former congolese military mutineers .
the head of british diplomacy , william hague , invited the rwandan president paul kagame to show restraint , said a foreign office spokesman .
last week , kigali had raised the possibility of military reprisals in the wake of the shells fell in rwandan territory .
on wednesday , the bunagana residents took to the streets of the town to welcome the entry of fardc soldiers .
&quot; we had one year with the m23 and it seemed unimaginable to be released by the military , &quot; a resident of this town bordering uganda .
&quot; we lived in terror ( of 23 ) , we are traumatized , &quot; said the man .
john kerry conceded , is unprecedented , that an american espionage &quot; had gone too far in an inappropriate manner . &quot;
john kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the united states about its surveillance programs in unprecedented admission that on several occasions , the spying &quot; had gone too far in an inappropriate manner . &quot;
the secretary of state also admitted that he had , as barack obama , ruled on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower edward snowden on the nsa &apos;s spying activities .
the leaks have put the u.s. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
speaking at an intergovernmental conference in london by video link , mr kerry said : &quot; it is undeniable that the president , myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things on automatic pilot because we had the opportunity , since the second world war and to the difficult years of the cold war , then of course the september 11 . &quot;
he then became the first high-ranking member of the government of the united states to admit that the american spy had crossed the line , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it has gone too far . &quot;
and the president is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he was now a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels wrong .
i assure you that innocent people will not be abused , in the framework of this process .
mr. kerry insisted , however , that the nsa was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we live in a new world where people are ready to blow . &quot;
there is a radical extremism around the world , which is determined to try to kill people , causing them to explode and addressed by governments .
and if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act ?
we have prevented aircraft from falling , blowing up buildings and people being killed , because we have been aware of the facts in advance .
meanwhile , us lawmakers will travel to europe to respond to concerns about the alleged us espionage case and convince the europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight against terrorism with the united states , said on thursday the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs .
senator chris murphy of connecticut said he had spoken to members of the european parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made on a possible withdrawal of anti-terror organizations because of frustration about the oversight of the national security agency .
&quot; it is really important for the protection of national security in the united states that the europeans are still in our mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism , &quot; said murphy , a democrat serving his first term , and president of the european affairs subcommittee of the u.s. senate , in an interview from washington .
and i am going to go to europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the nsa programs .
the press reports that the nsa has captured millions of communications in europe , which has damaged relations with some u.s. allies , however , the agency &apos;s director said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that nato allies had collected and shared with the united states .
other revelations reported documents disclosed by snowden that the nsa had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of the german chancellor angela merkel and 34 other heads of state .
the director of national intelligence , james clapper , justified the spying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice of the two sides .
in this atmosphere of tumult , murphy said that her office was organizing a tour of the congress , which is expected to take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses .
the names of other legislators meeting is expected to be unveiled in the coming days .
he said that the route remained to be defined .
murphy said the aim of the trip was to improve relations , but also to show &quot; tough love . &quot;
he explained that the european heads of state were to be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs that they applied themselves for years .
&quot; we can change our surveillance programs in order to better protect the rights of europeans , but they also need to understand that we are not alone in the world of espionage , &quot; murphy said .
meanwhile , mr. kerry is scheduled to travel this weekend to the middle east and poland to manage the resentment caused by american strategies in syria , egypt and iran , as well as by the u.s. surveillance activities .
scott brown &apos;s appeal rejected

in a statement , his club said he was &quot; very disappointed &quot; , believing that his appeal was fully justified .
for the ceo of titan , &quot; &quot; the proposed purchase of goodyear amiens starts with zero employee . &quot;
after having thrown in the towel with a vengeance in january for a partial resumption of goodyear amiens-nord , promised the closure , maurice taylor , ceo of the american tyre titan , expresses today , ready to save 333 jobs out of the 137 in the plant .
jean-luc m√©lenchon , minister of productive recovery , had already announced on monday 21 october .
having dropped the plan to purchase the plant in january , you will return today .
you spoke of violent attacks and insults , speaking of &quot; so-called workers , &quot; who &quot; work three hours &quot; a day , unions &quot; crazy , &quot; with the cgt .
this u-turn is not understood .
is it to please mr jospin ?
i was trying to do something nice for someone .
except for my wife .
mr jospin , is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs are among the best paid .
if i hurt anyone by my words , i am sorry .
but france has a high level of tax and unemployment too .
the truth hurts you ?
working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours underdevelops france .
in india , china and other countries , is ten to twelve hours a day .
but i don &apos;t have any prejudices about france .
what i see is a factory that produces good agricultural tires , good facilities , is well located and has space to expand .
why titan he needs so much of this plant ?
titan does not need to buy the plant .
but , with the right price and skilled workers , it is worth a try .
what kind of agreement you expect between the cgt and goodyear ?
if , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , goodyear had offered employees a good severance package , i think that 100 % of employees have accepted .
now , imagine that titan buys goodyear plant closed .
therefore , titan could move the machines to poland or any other country of the european union , which still has its own currency .
i think that mr jospin knows that .
however , it wants to keep the plant in amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs .
titan accepts to recruit among the approximately 1,200 employees of goodyear .
mr. jospin also he needs a commitment of titan before trying to get the cgt to sit at the table with goodyear .
the first step is that the cgt and goodyear to seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees .
therefore , there will be more employees at the plant .
mr jospin said that you were ready to ensure these 333 jobs over four years .
can you confirm it ?
the only number that i mentioned to the minister is 333 .
i know he would want a guarantee of four years .
but , as i told you , the cgt and goodyear must first agree on severance payments .
if all employees accept them , the plan to purchase the plant starts with zero employee .
how can we give guarantees of employment when there are no more employees on the site ?
if mr jospin comes the cgt and goodyear to agree and that titan is buying the plant , we intend to remain amiens-nord over four years .

the supreme court validates the law of health system reform to obama
great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court said today that the law for the reform of the health system , ratified by obama was constitutional .
by 5 votes to 4 , the justices upheld the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act on the patient protection and affordable care ) - which requires that citizens buy health insurance by 2014 , under penalty of having to pay a fine - and said it was constitutional under the government &apos;s taxing power .
the president of the supreme court , john roberts , joined the four more liberal members of the court , while the justices scalia , thomas , alito and kennedy expressed their disagreement .
the court also validated the other sections of the law of 2,700 pages and has also considered that the provision of the law to reform the health care system , which stipulates that it is lowering the threshold for eligibility for medicaid under penalty of losing all federal funding for the program was coercive in accordance with the constitution .
the procedure to block the law was brought by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
all the major republican candidates for the presidential election in 2012 during the primaries , including the nominee mitt romney , are fiercely opposed to the law .
aretha franklin will go on stage in december
the detroit news reports that the queen of soul will be on december 21 at the sound board , motorcity casino hotel .
ms. franklin is in november to record an album for clive davis and sony music , produced by don was and kenny &quot; babyface &quot; edmonds .
without specifying the illness she was suffering , the famous interpreter of respect had told the media on 16 october that the side effects of treatment she received were &quot; difficult . &quot;
she claims to be &quot; happy to be back . &quot;
it would teach the myths and legends to children as &quot; models of lifestyle , &quot; says the author .
the legend of thor could show that &quot; brute force is not up to the ruse , &quot; while the legends of king arthur revealed the importance of having a dream .
saying that many myths would be &quot; far too violent , too outrageous and , in some cases , far too obscene to be taught in schools , &quot; crossley-holland called a &quot; careful selection &quot; of the works adapted to age .
&quot; i find it incredible that in america , the myths and folklore are already part of education , &quot; he said .
i would argue in favour of the project for 20 years .
he added that the fact that the authors and teachers are teaching &quot; overt &quot; children &quot; drop completely , &quot; the messages as &quot; sublime &quot; in pleasant stories .
crossley-holland , who translated beowulf of the anglo-saxon and wrote the penguin book of norse myths and british folk tales , said : &quot; you may have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope .
not that everything has to be simplified or finish well , but there is an innate sense of right and wrong .
and he must be sublimated , revealed through a story rather than said .
the basis of the shows and does not say .
u.s. green light to the publicis-omnicom merger
publicis and omnicom said on friday it had received no objections from the u.s. authorities for their merger , is closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency .
the merger brings the second global agency , omnicom and publicis .
&quot; omnicom group and publicis groupe today announced the expiration of the previously announced merger of publicis and omnicom group , under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 , as amended , &quot; the two groups announced in a news release .
they also received the necessary approvals in canada , india and turkey , after south africa and south korea .
the expiration of the hsr review in the united states and the authority issued decisions in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the iga .
&quot; the merger is also conditional on other regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups , &quot; they added .
new class-action against the brothers st. croix
a new request for class-action suit was filed against the brothers st. croix , on sexual assault , which allegedly took place , this time at saint joseph &apos;s oratory , as well as several orphanages , schools and colleges .
the request is based on the testimony of the complainant , identified as &quot; j &quot; , who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s , first notre-dame-des-neiges by his teacher brother , then by his confessor father bernard , st. joseph &apos;s oratory , where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter .
the first appeal was only three , and when we announced the settlement , many people told us : &quot; i was , can i register ? , &quot; said lawyer alain arsenault , who represents the victims in the two appeals .
the class action , which has been tabled is notable for the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of st. croix .
at present , the appeal brings complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers croix .
the alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal , since several of the targeted schools closed their doors in the 1960s .
the appeal also stressed that the congregation of st. croix and st. joseph &apos;s oratory , which is a separate entity , &quot; allowed sexual abuse are perpetrated against children , &quot; that they &quot; have a moral , religious and psychological pressure on the victims , &quot; they &quot; were aware of sexual abuse and the hushed , however , &quot; and that they &quot; knowingly and deliberately chose to ignore the problem . &quot;
these latest accusations are based on letters written by the brothers &apos; lawyer , me √âmile perrin , in the 1990s , but also by research in the archives on the subject by the brother wilson kennedy , a former st. croix &apos;s brother who publicly denounced the abuse .
the class action must first pass the admissibility in superior court .
once the admissibility accepted by the court , the second stage , the hearings on the merits .
in the case of first resort , the congregation of st. croix had agreed to settle out of court before the hearings are conducted on the substance .
congo : the army is preparing a fresh assault
children play on a charred armoured vehicle which belonged to the rebels of the m23 at kibumba , on october 31 , 2013 , in the east of the drc .
the congolese army was preparing on friday to a fresh assault against the rebel strongholds of 23 near bunagana , in eastern drc .
the aim is to dislodge the m 23 of the hills overlooking bunagana .
yesterday we took the bugina hill , which overlooks the mbuzi .
today , mbuzi should fall .
there will be more than the runyonyi hill .
&quot; that is not very strategic chanzu , &quot; told the ap the governor of north kivu , julien paluku .
mr. paluku plans to visit on saturday in bunagana .
political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion , is located on the ugandan border , about 80 kilometres north of goma .
it was echoed on wednesday by the armed forces of the democratic republic of the congo on wednesday .
since then , several hundred irr√©ductibles m 23 , are cut off to nearly 2,000 meters of altitude on the farm hills in runyonyi and chanzu , mbuzi , relatives of bunagana and jomba nearby
in jomba , a resident who had reported nearby fighting on thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was &quot; calm since this morning . &quot;
according to him , a woman and her child were killed in the fighting and were buried .
a girl was shot and wounded , and three other people were injured , including one seriously , evacuated by the fardc , added the witness quoted by afp .
since the resumption of fighting between the fardc and rebels on 25 october , both sides did not result in any loss of life .
the court blocked a decision on the policy of control and search of the nypd
a federal appeals court blocked on thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the programme of control and search of the new york police department and functus record .
the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit ) indicated that the decision of judge shira scheindlin was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal by the city .
the judge had ruled in august that the city had violated the constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens .
the city draws its conclusions and its remedial orders , including a decision to award a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it .
the court of appeal heard on tuesday the arguments on the request for suspension .
the appeals court said the judge should be relieved of the case because it has breached the code of conduct for judges by undermining the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , in part because of a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to criticism of the court .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and hispanic men under their control and search program .
it has appointed an outside monitor to oversee the changes , including the reform of policies , training and supervision , and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the neighbourhoods where the greatest number of controls .
in august , new york city has agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police control .
the hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after the march 14 , 2014 .
the tactical control and the search has been criticized by many civil rights advocates .
this system of control and search there for decades in some form , but the number of inspections has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor michael bloomberg , to reach its highest level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that were primarily black and hispanic men .
a lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and transformed into collective action .
the supporters calling for changes in the program control and search of the nypd say they will end the unfair practices , will be more effective police forces and we trust , and will change how police departments use the policy .
opponents say such changes would undermine the morale of the police without lowering crime , would be a waste of money and would not solve the larger problem of police forces under pressure after the police numbers were greatly reduced in the last decade .
the judge stressed that it did not put an end to the practice of stop and search , which are constitutional , but reformed how the nypd was implementing its controls .
the nsa revelations increase the paranoia of companies to oversight of state
on a spring day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew at low altitude over the british consulate in frankfurt , germany &apos;s financial capital .
at the behest of the federal office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the german national intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the roof of the american outpost , located less than 5 km from the european central bank and the bundesbank .
the german media explained that the halfdozen hoped to identify the presence of antennas to listen and that the transaction has sparked an exchange between the united states and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , the director of national intelligence , insisted again in september that the united states does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of american companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits .
but since edward snowden , the consultant turned whistleblower , has begun to reveal her treasure trove of information on the secrets of the supervision of the united states , european governments and business leaders no longer know if the director to speak .
reports that the u.s. national security agency spied on the brazilian oil company petrobras and had access to data held by american service providers of storage in the cloud , including google and yahoo , have attracted more than ever the paranoia of companies to state oversight .
the revelation that the phone of the german chancellor angela merkel had been hacked , maybe even for a decade , was the straw that broke the camel &apos;s back .
if the most powerful person in europe can be covered , while business leaders are also potential targets .
snowden has made transparent intensive collaboration between us intelligence agencies and companies .
i believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest .
&quot; germany must wake up , &quot; said oliver gr√ºn , president of bitmi , which represents the german smes in the it sector .
german companies believe that the united states will be as important a risk as china when it comes to industrial espionage and theft of data , according to a survey published in july by the consulting firm ey .
however , in all the documents disclosed by mr. snowden , there is no indication so far that the united states had sent trade secrets of foreign companies to u.s. companies .
politicians have expressed concern at the idea that the eu does not have adequate computer and internet skills and think that it should try to reduce its dependence on the united states .
business leaders are skeptical about it .
a member of the german parliament said that we should create a google .
i cannot turn a blind eye and reopen them slowly ...
&quot; it is not the right way to do it , &quot; says hasso plattner , president of the german business software company , sap .
if we wanted a strong it industry in europe , then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago .
everything is subsidized in germany , coal cars , passing by the farmers .
everything but the it industry .
still , the scale and sophistication of american spy agencies exposed by snowden &apos;s revelations were a shock for some companies that previously believed that china was the biggest risk in terms of oversight .
a big change is happening in cloud computing since european leaders acknowledged that the data stored in the united states are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey by the cloud security alliance , a trade body , approximately 10 % of americans have given up their plans to use an american supplier of storage in the cloud services after the revelations about the american data mining program prism .
jim snabe , co-director of sap , said : &quot; our clients ask us a question today than we were a year ago : where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this court ? &quot;
many german leaders indicate that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew , that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be maintained at all costs .
it is not surprising that there is economic espionage .
there are always had .
&quot; it is a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion , &quot; says kurt bock , director general of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level like we are frisking them , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place , in case it would give the advantage to an opponent .
large companies have long hammer the message that it is unwise to recover a free usb stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room .
ulrich hackenberg , member of the executive board of automaker audi , said that the collection of mobile phones before the meetings of the council , so that they could not be used as a remote listening devices , is a common practice for years .
the german halfdozen advises its leaders consider using simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad because of the threat to the integrity of the smartphones .
prepaid phones are then discarded .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in germany , many smes are world leaders in their particular niches .
&quot; smes often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access , &quot; the halfdozen warns in a report .
the u.s. alert their own societies on the economic spying activities carried out by other countries .
the national intelligence estimate ( nie ) conducted in february by the united states , france , russia and israel , guilty of the second degree to have carried out acts of piracy of economic information , behind china , according to the washington post .
a member of the board of directors of a renowned german company believed that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bernard squarcini , former director of the french domestic intelligence agency the dcri , said in an interview this month : &quot; the services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , spying on their allies . &quot;
a tax on foreign property owners to burst the bubble in london
the treasury has provisionally estimated the extent of the tax on capital gains , but is awaiting a final decision by mr osborne , who , in the 2012 budget , included a stamp duty of 7 % for properties costing more than ¬£ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold in a company rather than individual .
the stamp duty already applies to residential properties of the boroughs of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea and is ¬£ 708 million in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , which exceeds the total amount of northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north east , north west and yorkshire and the humber region .
mr cook said : &quot; following the increase in the stamp duty on properties of high value and the introduction of the antiavoidance law , it is very difficult to argue that the high value properties are sous-impos√©es regardless of the effects of the housing tax system obsolete . &quot;
&quot; but this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in london or the current owners reluctant to sell , &quot; he added .
real estate - 5 to 10 % of the highest price of the real estate market - in the thriving sector , located in southwest london stretching from fulham to wimbledon , increased by a record 11.8 % during the last year .
the prices in the central london show a steady increase from year to year by 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an &quot; internal market &quot; in the southwest of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) ( 6.5 % ) recovering , according to savills research .
the shutdown in the usa has slowed the rise of the car market
the closure during 16 days of most federal agencies weighed on the growth of car sales in the united states in october , show figures released on friday by the builders , five of the top six with performance below expectations .
the big three detroit automakers posted double-digit growth compared to october 2012 , but only general motors did better than expected .
the analysts expected an average of 15.4 million in annualized sales and adjusted for seasonal variations , but the market stood at 15.3 million , according to estimates from adam jonas , a morgan stanley analyst .
in a note to clients , he believes that this slight setback can be explained by &quot; the &quot; shutdown &quot; government and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month . &quot;
gm , however , reported an increase of nearly 16 % of its sales last month to 226 p402 vehicles , against 211 563 expected by the consensus .
the four brands of the group saw their trade performance is improving compared to october 2012 .
ford , which continues to benefit from the success of its pickups , saw its sales increase by 14 % over one year to 191,985 vehicles , while the consensus expected 194 301 .
for its part , chrysler , controlled by fiat announced a rise of 11 % of its sales to 140 c083 vehicles , against 143 536 expected .
toyota and nissan also have sales below the consensus , despite increases over one year of 8.8 % and 14.2 % respectively .
on the new york stock exchange , gm earned 1.4 % to 12h16 gmt while ford ceded 1.1 % .

a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland was launched by the british government .
the work done by hs2 ltd suggests that the high-speed services to scotland and the north of england , will start at the beginning of the phase 1 in 2026 .
the transport minister baroness kramer said the project &quot; would bring the uk . &quot;
the scottish transport minister , keith brown said he was &quot; excited &quot; by the idea of working with the british government on the project .
phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between london and the west midlands .
upon completion of phase 2 , the lines will serve manchester and leeds .
in june , the government revised upward the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between london and the north of england , from 32.7 md ¬£ 42.6 multi-billion pound .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , asked hs2l ltd on improving rail capacity and improved journey times for the north of england and scotland .
this must include the possibility of journey times between glasgow and edinburgh to three hours .
baroness kramer said : &quot; our aim for hs2l focuses on a truly national network that will bring the uk and its cities . &quot;
we push the hs2l project because the benefits are enormous .
without him , we are facing a problem of capacity of our rail network .
but it is also to develop connectivity among the 18 major british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , so that they are better thanks to hs2 .
the british secretary of state for scotland , alistair carmichael , added : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland . &quot;
for the scottish government , keith brown called mr. carmichael to support &quot; unequivocally &quot; the inclusion of scotland in the hs2 network .
mr brown said : &quot; high-speed rail has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to scotland , but it also makes the economic weight of scotland in the global project of a high-speed rail network in britain .
&quot; we are excited by the idea of working in partnership with the british government to review options to bring high speed rail to scotland , creating an advantage for all and completing the online accessibility that the scottish government is already planning .
&quot; i am eager to read the report with british ministers next year and we will decide together on the next steps . &quot;
un hails the new objectives in the fight against poverty
the un will get to work on a new series of targets to replace the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty .
australian diplomats have played a key role in the establishment of &quot; sustainable development &quot; to replace the mdgs , which expire in 2015 , before the un summit on sustainable development which began the day in rio de janeiro .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including ms gillard , during the summit .
un secretary general ban ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; i am pleased that the member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set goals of universal sustainable development ( odd ) , &quot; he added .
these odd will build on the progress achieved in the framework of the millennium development goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .
i will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the member states in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development that is based on the success of the mdgs .
parents of intersex children can choose &quot; indeterminate sex . &quot;
germany became the first european nation to recognize a third gender for infants born with ambiguous genitalia .
the male or female of new born no longer awarded , so rigid , at birth .
under the new law , parents will no longer be required to disclose the sex of their child , allowing them to enter an &quot; undetermined &quot; or &quot; unspecified &quot; on his birth certificate .
the aim of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a sex-change surgery for their babies , and to combat discrimination against intersex people .
according to the bbc , a person intersexed have said years later , &quot; i am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
i will remain the patchwork that created the doctors , bruised and scarface .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year , nor is it a boy or a girl .
they are lgbti , inter-sex forming part of the group of the sixty diseases diagnosed disorders of sexual development , a generic term for people with chromosome or gonads ( ovaries or testes ) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs .
wallis simpson could have been intersexed ..
the sexual identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the united states say that when sex cannot be determined , it is better to use the best available information for the award , then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical procedure , if any .
dr. jack drescher , a psychiatrist in new york and expert on sexual identification , said that the new german law &quot; seems to be a good idea . &quot;
the intersex children posed an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people are suffering from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical procedure , but it is not the case for most children , &quot; he added .
it is possible to make a sexual assignment without the operation , and see how the identity develops .
science , which is how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
nobody can answer the question of why this happens .
it &apos;s like the mystery that surrounds the homosexual people .
a report submitted to the european commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not related to sex , but rather to their constitution , which is not only that of a man or a woman exclusively , but in general the two at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other .
these features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics ( such as muscle mass , hair , chest and stature ) , the primary sexual traits ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones .
the report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by transgender and intersex people in employment , and the extent of the acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
young boys gender non-conforming now camps specially for them .
australia and nepal already allow adults to register male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; on their official documents .
in june , a 52-year-old australian , norrie may-welby , became the first person in the world to have been recognized as &quot; neutral &quot; after winning his appeal , which allows him to keep an &quot; unspecified &quot; for life .
the german passports will contain a third appointment next to m or f-x for intersex , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighboring france , gender issues are still controversial , according to a report broadcast on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of legislators in this deeply catholic country have signed a petition for the &quot; gender theory &quot; be removed from school books .
the american site catholic online also objected to german law , writing that &quot; since the world is dragged into a new situation , where the genre is a choice , but where sexual activity is not reversed , the other two pillars of civilization . &quot;
in maryland , the mother of an infant on baby zone has also said that it would prefer that one sex is given to babies at birth .
&quot; parenting is stressful enough without the additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , &quot; she said on the website for young parents .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , children born without male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites , named after the greek god who had a double .
and there is barely a decade , the medical community believed the genre as a slate , we can erase and redraw it .
but now , many of those who question the ethical basis of the surgery , knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong , not knowing how a child will feel its sexual reassignment when he grows up .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century , this was called a psychiatric emergency , &quot; drescher said .
when these children were born , we did not call the psychiatrist , one caller to the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by dr. john money , of the johns hopkins university , who believes that the genre is malleable .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that the social and environmental signals-how parents raising a child-interact with genes and hormones of a child for the shape in order to be identified as male or female .
but in a case of 1966 , known as &quot; john joan , &quot; his theories have given rise to controversy .
he advised parents to a small boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to castrate entirely , by removing the testicles , and raised as a girl .
&quot; money has presented it as a case of successful transition , but this was not the case , &quot; drescher said .
at the age of about 15 years , he has re-emerged as a boy and married a woman .
but at 38 , he committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors &quot; always repeat this model . &quot;
but in the 1990s , with the arrival of the internet , those who survived these sex change operations say &quot; &#91; that &#93; they are not satisfied with the outcome . &quot;
such is the case of jim bruce , a 36-year-old writer from montana , who was born with xy chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs .
doctors could not say if he had a large clitoris , or a small penis , and were convinced that he would never have a &quot; satisfactory &quot; life as a man .
so shortly after its birth in 1976 , bruce has undergone surgical removal of the external body and testicles and was raised as a girl .
he was taking female hormones at the age of 12 .
&quot; i knew that i was not a girl , &quot; he told abcnews.com .
i was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 , he underwent a vaginoplastie ..
but depressed and realizing that something wasn &apos;t right , he asked his medical record .
what he found was horrified .
i was sterilized at birth - and no one had ever told me .
bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( dds ) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for her sexual organs can develop .
after learning the truth , he became a man with a testosterone treatment and had her breasts removed .
the surgery made him sterile .
today , he defends the cause of others in an organization called interface project , which seeks to standardize the collection of intersex people .
but anne tamar-mattis , executive director of the nonprofit organization based in california advocates for informed choice , is concerned that the german law &quot; invites labeling and stigma . &quot;
&quot; many activists are worried that the german law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child an &quot; indeterminate &quot; sex , &quot; she said .
we are afraid that it encourages the interventions .
we believe that it would be better to assign a male or female , and wait .
but we have not seen what the law would give , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said his organization supported the australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre , &quot; she added .
the german law regarding the attribution of sex at birth .
this is not a battle that young children should undertake at that age .
when they grow up , they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz , a radiologist who specializes in mammograms in pittsburgh , whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and to help thousands of people in a support group , said that the german law &quot; empower &quot; parents and children .
dr. baratz &apos;s daughter , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but suffers from a capacity / dds called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome .
due to the failure of its androgen receptors , katie has developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no womb or ovaries .
now aged 29 , katie is married and in child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
although it is sterile , she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers .
&quot; the law allows some latitude for parents so they do not have to make hasty decisions , &quot; baratz said .
this gives them time to do some tests and understand them , and a time before &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female . &quot;
thus , all goes well - you can raise your child and the like .
you have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent .
you don &apos;t have to rush for a surgical procedure that is irreversible .
&quot; it puts the child at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes , &quot; she said .
finally , the child will decide what gender he or she feels the most comfortable - and it is something fantastic .
this allows the child to make the decision for himself .

the cry of despair of a voter for obama
i voted twice for president obama , believing in the possibility of a change
he said that obama has made commendable efforts were thwarted by the republican party &apos;s obstructionism
obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of obamacare , nor the drone attacks
the memory of the 2008 obama campaign is a sad reminder of what might have been
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the 2nd year of medicine at harvard medical school .
i &apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days .
it is a book that , i thought , would encourage me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope .
it is called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; and memories of the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when i finished the medical records of patients in the evening and go to sleep , this book remm√®ne me when the policies inspired millions of people and where the speech could leave you breathless .
the election ended in a landslide victory and the presenters of the news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment .
my comrades wept with joy and my parents have retained all the newspapers they found .
a young visionary team moves into the white house and the nation was ready for change .
during the transition period of obama before taking office in 2008 , he had 82 % of favourable opinions .
and then i shut the book .
returning to the present is a difficult , it &apos;s like waking from a dream .
it is hard to remember these days full of optimism , such as distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
the change really happened in the years that followed the first time i voted .
it had nothing to do with what i had imagined .
i put the credit of obama &apos;s major achievements since the passage of the affordable care act ( affordable care act ) until the departure from iraq of our army , through the end of the &quot; neither seen nor experienced &quot; and the assassination of osama bin laden .
in addition , i think the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of guantanamo , among other things .
but after repeatedly defended the obama administration against my peers and my colleagues , i can no longer provide explanations .
i am on the verge of despair .
the republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders , nor the child attacks innocent foreigners by drones .
she cannot explain that the national security agency collects data on americans &apos; privacy , nor the indictment of whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing .
it cannot justify the killing of anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , without trial , or the escape of public finance and exceeding authorized expenditures during presidential campaigns .
it cannot justify the conclusions of a report that said that the white house &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and , more recently , it does not excuse the failure to develop a single website for more than three years after the affordable care act was ratified .
i do not know if this is what i expected .
if , at 18 , i was supposed to understand that leadership could contradict the previous political campaigns .
of course , the electoral function is not predictable , because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance , like the massacre of newton , influence our public conversation .
however , all of the examples that i listed above seem to largely be the choice of the administration .
that is what bothers me the most .
i have voted for obama in 2012 , but not because i was excited about his candidacy .
mitt romney had a confused alternative and refined that seemed not to determine its policies or its positions .
i felt that obama , elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections , would keep the promises we heard for so long .
yet , while the index of favourable opinions plunged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book .
it makes me wish the numerous promises that have soared .
this week , i read the part of the book that describes how obama has suffered huge losses to clinton in the pennsylvania primary .
at a meeting of advertisements , he told his team that they can get back on track and remain true to their cause .
&quot; i want us to focus on our talent , &quot; he said .
we have to remember who we are .
here we are five years later , mr. president , and i don &apos;t agree with you more .
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of nathaniel morris .
the new star has managed a comeback , hearings , with 1.3 million viewers behind their tv station , or 5.6 % of audience share .
but the show was at the rendezvous ?
some 10,000 candidates stood in the hearings of this 10th season , to face the jury : the villain maurane , sinclair , perch√© andr√© manoukian and olivier .
on twitter , viewers shared their comments .
from the excitement of finding their favorite program , many were disappointed .
but why so much disappointment ?
no candidate appears to have really marked the first premium .
as every year , the first hearing stirs a wide choice of aspiring singers , for better and sometimes for worse .
but on twitter , we want to show emotion , originality , music ...
fortunately , a few here .
they are likely to have tried the new star , and sometimes even be gone until the end .
behind the television screens , the singer shared-use-equipment hits are still there , season after season .
others just have the ambition to make her laugh .
rbs suspended two traders on the exchange market
royal bank of scotland has suspended two traders on its foreign exchange market division , according to two sources close to the case , which shows once again that the global regulators over suspicions of market manipulation of currency starts to bear fruit .
some of the world &apos;s biggest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigation of the largest financial market in the world , where 5.3 trillion us dollars change hands each day .
the two traders are the first employees of rbs to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation , which echoes the scandal of manipulation of the libor interbank rate .
the bank , which declined to comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; the ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulators , &quot; said a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
last month , sources close to the case said that rbs had sent files of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader , the british regulator , the financial conduct authority .
this trader , richard usher , left rbs in 2010 and had been suspended from his position as european head of spot currency trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of foreign exchange spot trading at citi , was placed on leave this week , while matt gardiner , senior currency trader at barclays and ubs , was suspended by standard chartered this week .
none of these traders have no charges .
mr. usher &apos;s record included instant messages sent to and from bankers at barclays and citigroup , sources close to the case said .
ubs said this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the swiss regulator , finma , said that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
worldwide , at least six authorities - the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the u.s. department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority-examine the allegations made on bankers who allegedly conspired to manipulate exchange rates .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators , said sources close to the case .
banks picked instant messages and emails for years to find cases of wrongdoing .
the news about these investigations shook traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of the trading units from investment banks in recent years , but that was challenged this year due to the weak currency volatility which limits the opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to play down the issue by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the currency market highly liquid , but the traders seniors explained that this is not necessarily true .
a senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms &quot; explains that it is possible to start to have an impact on the market at a low cost . &quot;
the news came on the same day that credit suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in his office of the london stock exchange traded funds this week after he caused a loss of $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators .
&quot; we are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was under control , &quot; said a representative of credit suisse .
a chinese newspaper , which launched an appeal &quot; will be redrafted &quot;
a chinese newspaper , which launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be overhauled , said a regulator of the press .
the new express newspaper based in guangzhou , issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist chen yongzhou .
but mr chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories of a semi-public company .
now , the new express will undergo a complete overhaul , &quot; said the governor .
the &quot; realignment &quot; comes from the administration of guangdon for press and publishing , radio , film and television .
a preliminary investigation showed that the new express , owned by the yangcheng evening news group , had published several articles on incorrect listed company zoomlion between september 2012 and august 2013 .
&quot; the drafting of new express was disorganized , &quot; said the regulator in a statement .
he said that he had decided to &quot; impose an administrative sanction to chen yongzhou in him withdrawing his press card . &quot;
he also &quot; ordered the yangcheng evening news group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of new express , and recommended that it conducts an investigation to the responsible persons at new express and re-plans immediately the newspaper &apos;s management team . &quot;
mr chen wrote several articles for the new express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called zoomlion .
after his arrest , his newspaper published twice a first appeal for his release , writing that he supported his journalism .
but mr. chen then appeared on a public television station , where he admitted to have published false stories for money .
&quot; in this case , i hurt zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public , &quot; he told the public television network cctv .
i did so mainly because i was running after money and fame .
i realized my mistake .
following the apology from mr. chen , new express published an apology on its front page , writing that he had not properly verified his articles .
several suspects have recently made televised confessions .
experts say that people are routinely forced to make their confessions , despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year forbidding the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself .
obama backtracked on its reform of the health system
under a barrage of criticism , president obama returned yesterday on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that &quot; if you &apos;re satisfied with your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their providers , republicans criticized the president in recent days , accusing it of misleading the american people .
yesterday , barack obama has adjusted its original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of people with health insurance that they can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in boston .
speaking of what he calls &quot; an effervescence in the news &quot; about the terminations , president obama encouraged americans who received the notice to look for a new insurance on the market .
most people can get comprehensive health plans and better suited for the same price , or even cheaper than expected .
&quot; you gain , &quot; he said .
the administration announced that one should not be surprised if the 5 % of the population who get their insurance themselves were forced to change the regime , because they do not meet the new standards required under the affordable care act .
&quot; let me say directly to these americans : you deserve better , &quot; said kathleen widen during his testimony before the committee on energy and commerce in washington .
ms widen ) , which oversees the implementation of the affordable care act , said the launch in october of the online market had &quot; failed miserably . &quot;
&quot; i am as frustrated and angry as anyone , &quot; she added .
i look forward to regain your confidence .
it &apos;s a widen exasperated that pronounced the sentence , while she thought his microphone cut , through an assistant , seated behind her at the meeting of the assembly yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with billy long , a republican representative from missouri , for whether it should join the obamacare .
for more than three hours , billy long continued to urge ms widen why the &quot; architect &quot; of the affordable care act did not voluntarily renounced the government sponsored insurance to buy a plan through healthcare. gov , it now boasts of millions of americans .
the tribute to the folk of the coen brothers
&quot; inside llewyn davis &quot; by the coen brothers , grand prize at the 2009 cannes film festival , is a nostalgic and funny film about the greenwich village in 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate , before the arrival of bob dylan .
joel and ethan coen , whose film has been the subject of a retrospective at the cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise , had won the palme d &apos;or at cannes in 1991 for barton fink .
failing to hire dylan or the trio peter , paul and mary , joel and ethan coen threw their vested on the rising star of american cinema , oscar isaac , 33 , but also on the global pop star justin timberlake .
in this film , full of humor , where the music is a central character and songs performed live , oscar isaac is a folk musician and singer , while timberlake , his friend in the film , leaves the pop to folk music with a contagious jubilation .
as for carey mulligan , she left the rich trappings of daisy mulligan in &quot; the great gatsby &quot; for less glamorous clothes , a soft-spoken when she sings , but the expletive charged rampage when she speaks .
&quot; inside llewyn davis &quot; tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can &apos;t break through and get angry with the whole earth .
he reluctantly accepts the replacements on the hoof in the studios .
homeless , he toured sofas of friends who still want to receive it .
an air of documentary
&quot; his relationship with success is tortured , this is what we wanted : a mixture of bad luck , a guy who is not there at the right time , which is not a careerist , but integrates with a self-destructive behaviour , &quot; said to the press , ethan coen , crowned with his brother joel several oscars and prizes at cannes .
if llewyn davis did not exist , the two filmmakers folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time like the folk musician dave von ronk .
the idea was to show the time before the advent of greenwich village , new york headquarters to become &quot; the epicenter of the folk music boom that would lead to international stars , &quot; writes journalist elijah wald , a friend of van ronk .
the film then resemble a documentary , dusty music label invaded by 33 t sale-or-return inhabited by an old secretary hilarious , the musical choices of the studios of the era and the cafes of the singers .
the magic of the coen brothers operates by integrating a funny character who runs the film at all times : a magnificent red cat under craquant , companion of fortune as llewyn davis .
asked about how he composed his character , the actor and singer justin timberlake recalled having &quot; grew up in tennessee , bathed by the blues and country . &quot;
&quot; my first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar , &quot; he added .
for justin timberlake , if the work is required to be considered as &quot; good &quot; , &quot; chance can also launch the career of someone , &quot; and &quot; more and more today . &quot;
as llewyn davis who refuses any compromise on his music , pop star explains that in a career , &quot; the most important thing is to not get caught in anything that can prevent us from express . &quot;
chevron , the second-largest american oil company , reported on friday a drop in its quarterly profit due to the decline in refining margins , while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the objectives of the group .
its net profit for the third quarter fell to $ 4.95 billion , or $ 2.57 per share , up from 5.25 billion , or $ 2.69 per share , a year earlier .
the analysts surveyed by reuters expect , on average , a profit of $ 2.71 per share .
the group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter , up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier .
the company is 2.65 million bpd for this year , with a growth of 25 % of the expected production by 2017 .
the major part of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in australia .
because of the cost of these projects , the annual capital expenditure increased from seven billion dollars in two years and expected to reach 36.7 billion dollars in 2013 .
the profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter , while profits from downstream activities ( refining and chemical production ) dropped by 45 % to $ 380 million .
this decline in refining margins affects the whole of the sector .
the main competitor of chevron , exxon mobil reported on thursday a net profit decline despite rising oil and gas production .

the nsa snooping : the united states is &quot; gone too far , &quot; kerry
the united states are sometimes went &quot; too far &quot; in terms of espionage , has recognized the secretary of state john kerry , in this first confession from washington in the dispute with europe over the massive collection of data by the national security agency ( nsa ) .
after ten days of scandal , revelations and denials from the united states and its european allies , it is the first time that an official u.s. government explicitly admits controversial practices in the nsa &apos;s interception of communications and data in europe .
&quot; in some cases , i grant you , as president , some of these actions have gone too far , and we will ensure that it does not happen again in the future , &quot; said john kerry , at a conference in london that he was from washington on thursday 31 october via video link .
in his televised speech , in the presence of his british counterpart william hague , the head of american diplomacy has largely justified the practice of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks .
citing the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , attacks in madrid in march 2004 and in london in july 2005 , john kerry assured that the american authorities had foiled several planned attacks , thanks to the interception of communications and information gathering .
&quot; we have in fact prevented planes from falling , as buildings exploded and people were murdered , because we were in a position to be aware of these projects , &quot; argued the boss of american diplomacy .
and , said john kerry for the europeans , &quot; i assure you that in this process of innocent people were not misled . &quot;
but we are trying to gather information .
&quot; and yes , in some cases , it has gone too far in an inappropriate manner , &quot; admitted the secretary of state , who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in paris , london and rome .
he assured on thursday evening that president obama was &quot; committed to try to clarify and that it was reviewing these practices so that nobody feels deceived . &quot;
but the controversy between americans and europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press .
according to the washington post , the nsa intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of google and yahoo .
the newspaper , citing documents obtained from the nsa revelations of edward snowden , says the program called &quot; muscular &quot; and conducted with the nsa &apos;s british counterpart , gchq , allows the two agencies to collect data from the optical fibers used by internet giants .
according one of the documents , some 181 million items were collected during the month of january-ranging from metadata on emails , text or audio or video .
these interceptions would be held outside the united states .
but yahoo and google have denied any connection with these practices .
for ten days , several major newspapers in france , germany , spain or italy , revealed that the nsa had intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from us allies and their leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel .
to the anger of european states and the leaks in the us press said that the american president was not aware of such eavesdropping , barack obama declined to speak on the matter , citing national security .
however , the powerful boss of the nsa , lieutenant general keith alexander , has denied that its intelligence agency has collected tens of millions of european citizens .
he even returned the ball to the european intelligence services that would have to take these communications , before providing them to the nsa .
this would include &quot; military operations &quot; in countries where nato allies are cooperating with the united states , and it would certainly not europe , said general alexander .
and the controversy was extended on friday in asia .
indonesia summoned the australian ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the us as part of a vast international spy network , which has also attracted the ire of china .
early puberty : vieillir earlier
studies show that young african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls .
the physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
the experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist specializing in health and family issues .
a mother should worry if the breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow 7 or 8 years old ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics , which took place this week in orlando , florida , dr. paul kaplowitz , p√©do-endocrinologue , explained that these physical changes are fairly common among young american and represent a new standard .
&quot; i spend a lot of time reassuring parents - in general , this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty , &quot; kaplowitz said .
the visible signs of development , such as budding breasts , hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors , appear earlier in girls .
but there was only a small step from the age of first menstruation in the past four decades .
in the united states , the average age is 12 and a half years , when he was 12 years old three quarters in 1970 .
&quot; once the chest started to grow , it is at least two or three years before the first appear , &quot; said kaplowitz , also the author of &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem . &quot;
the time is the more accurate test to find out how to go through puberty .
there is a debate about what constitutes the real onset of puberty , but it is considered &quot; early &quot; when breast development is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 .
in most cases , development slows or stops-it is something that a pediatrician can follow closely .
a more rapid evolution can justify tests conducted by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors and cysts .
there are treatments to delay the onset of first menstruation and prevent other consequences : a premature aging of the bones , which can dampen growth and a small adult size .
the recommendations on hormone therapy and are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .
the psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious with drugs , but acknowledged that &quot; the control of puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and feel for young girls to be different from others . &quot;
the other big problem is understandable : the parents simply do not want their very young girls have their rules .
&quot; they fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage health issues , &quot; kaplowitz said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls a woman whose daughter had her first menstruation .
even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules , she wasn &apos;t prepared emotionally .
she returned from the school frightened and upset of being the first among his friends .
there are many theories to the public on the causes of early puberty .
still , there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media .
the boys , as girls reach puberty earlier .
kaplowitz says that the most credible theory is that of the obesity epidemic .
he participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years old that binds the percentage of body fat at the onset of puberty .
other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
in this country , young african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls .
there are various explanations .
at the global level , the mechanisms of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by everything from the weather , economic conditions through the genes .
another problem : that boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area , the trend towards early puberty real is not as pronounced as in girls .
other doctors attending the conference of the paa emphasized the complexity of the subject .
the appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers .
&quot; we must be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a p√©do-endocrinologue working at the goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their paediatrician on how to talk with their child .
&quot; it can mean having a conversation sooner than expected , &quot; kaplowitz said .
if you stay calm , your child will respond well in general .
girls with early puberty should be reassured that , even when it happens sooner than expected , the process is part of life .
a driver at 210 km / h with a hot drink between the legs was imposed a fine of ¬£ 1,000
a motorist was fined ¬£ 1,000 for taxiing to 210 km / h with a hot drink in balance between his legs .
andrew howie , 35 , of tiptree in essex , was spotted driving his mercedes benz on the a120 in braintree on 27 may .
when the police arrested him , they found the drink to go between his legs .
the court of first instance of colchester , howie admitted the offence of driving without the care and attention required .
the seven points on his licence withdrawn , led to a withdrawal of permit for six months .
howie was also ordered to pay costs amounting to 90 pounds and a victim surcharge of ¬£ 100 .
a former hostage in lebanon : &quot; the back is quite complicated to manage . &quot;
abducted in beirut on march 8 , 1986 with three members of his team of &quot; airtime &quot; to film a demonstration of hezbollah , the journalist jean-louis normandin was released nearly 21 months later , on november 27 , 1987 .
retired since 2008 , he participated in 2004 to the creation of the association for the defence of the hostages &quot; hostages of the world , &quot; which he presides over several years .
his main goal : get the opportunity for the hostages and their kidnappers in front of the international criminal court .
detained more than 1,000 days , the four hostages from aqim ( al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb ) daniel larribe , thierry dol , pierre legrand and marc f√©ret were released on tuesday .
after medical examinations at the val-de-gr√¢ce military hospital on wednesday afternoon , they had been reunited with their families .
and try , little by little , to resume their lives .
&quot; le nouvel observateur , &quot; asked jean-louis normandin , 62 , former grand reporter , retired since 2008 , president of the association &quot; hostages of the world . &quot;
from the evening of your release , you were on the set of the &quot; antenne 2 p.m .. &quot;
what are your memories of your release ?
in particular , in beirut .
when i am released , i find myself in the trunk of a car , where i meet-without seeing it because he is black-roger auque .
he told me that &quot; one is released , &quot; but i &apos;m not sure , and think that we can still be killed .
one is very excited , but also very tense .
this is war , and those who lead us are also very tight .
they settle on the edge of a sidewalk .
there are syrian military .
then we arrive at the hotel summerland , where the press is present .
the french lead us to the french embassy .
it is the time of the first phone calls to the parents , family , friends , to the press ...
i remember taking a bath for one hour .
and to have dinner in a t-shirt at the french embassy .
i also remember a short night to talk with roger and marchiani .
the tension is still there , because we don &apos;t have the resources to evacuate to larnaca airport in cyprus .
arriving there by helicopter , taking a private plane back to france via corfu and solenzara , where pasqua features .
how did you arrive on french soil ?
it lands at orly .
chirac , prime minister , is there .
it &apos;s a little brutal .
there is an incredible scramble .
and much of the media .
when i left there were three television channels .
i go back and there are full .
descending the stairs of the plane , the reunion with my son and my parents , my friends , this is all very emotional .
between the airport and home , many motorcycles follow our car roussin leads .
the bikers , craving for photos and follow me to my home , where i have to do a little the police to prevent some up .
the media pressure is enormous .
it does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
but the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is hard to comprehend .
out of a hole and it is suddenly under the media spotlight .
it &apos;s a little complicated , a little violent , too complex to manage .
but it was the hardest .
on the day , i am to 8 : 00 p.m. the next day as i am on tv .
then began a rehabilitation of sorts to the life , very gently , for a month or two that are a little like vacations .
how to have passed the medical examinations and debriefing dgse ?
i had the right to an initial medical examination in corsica .
the rest was taken to the val-de-gr√¢ce the following days my back : radios , all kinds of tests and meeting with a psychiatrist .
it is not a meeting that does everything , but we know we can count on him , remember if necessary , that it is not left to ourselves .
it is part of the procedure .
i also met the intelligence services .
they asked me questions about the hostage-takers .
it was logical .
i was not embarrassed .
today , how do you react to the release of four hostages of niger ?
i listen to what is said .
the debate on the ransom .
few things annoy me , others less so .
i try to separate the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as chairman of the association &quot; hostages of the world &quot; that allows me to put in the distance , and seems to me much more interesting to talk about .
i wonder , for example , on the definition of resilience .
above all , i am fighting , with others , for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage .
i think there is a problem of semantics .
he described the hostage taking of hostages &quot; politics &quot; - which is most often the case - and allow the hostages to have access to justice , to complain and get their hostage takers in front of the international criminal court .
today , once again , everyone is in compassion , emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
but who said that the hostages might also have access to justice ?
a court in the hague is for it .
why do we not say to hostage-takers &quot; you have violated the rules of war , such as those of all the geneva conventions , we will bring you to justice ? &quot;
it seems to me , however , legitimate , hit in the right direction .
this message is heard but not listened to , and that makes me angry .
that is my primary battle .

( a la seyne , relocation due to rats turned to the controversy

the deratification company makes two crossings a year , and increasingly , we , in our office , every request of inhabitants .
we have made since the end of last winter , 64 .
the district has not abandoned , and the rats don &apos;t thrive in the city .
for reasons of protection of the environment and public health , the deratification products are four times less effective than in the past , certainly , but for two rats , one will not kill a kid .

rbs also explained that this internal restructuring free from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital , thereby strengthening its ability to lend .
the bank and london have stressed that the &quot; bad bank &quot; would draw a line under the past , the government has in particular been accused of interfering in the management of rbs .
&quot; we can now move forward , we worry about the future and 90 % of assets which are a really good bank and build a major bank for customers and for the uk , &quot; said the new director general ross mcewan to the press .
george kerevan : the break-up of europe gives the choice for scots
another day , another disturbing history of independence .
this time , we are warned that an independent scotland would be required to join the european area of free movement for eu membership .
and now we hear stories of passport control in berwick and a border of barbed wire along hadrian &apos;s wall .
while it is true that the newspaper of strathclyde said the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of europe , it wasn &apos;t even in the headlines ( and expected ) .
nor has anyone said that the eu member states spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules when it suits them .
since scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , a persistent disregard of the rules would be a concession that brussels could offer in exchange for what it wants to achieve from the scots .
it is a story that is not one of them .
and a story so old that it is now frozen : i heard for the first time the canard that &quot; independence means the passport control &quot; more than 40 years .
nevertheless , we forgot something interesting in this interpretation of a dusty old tale .
why an independent scotland should follow the instructions of europe ?
why share the yoke of london against brussels , especially now ?
here &apos;s the real news about europe : the great postwar plan to unify europe is definitely dead .
with the euro crisis , the european project is officially dead .
across europe , parties which oppose the √Öu or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party alternative for germany , founded only this year and came out of nowhere , brought together almost five million votes in federal elections in september and released the liberal democratic party ( equivalent of our liberal democrats ) of the bundestag .
there has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis marked a turning point .
the austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , coupled to the straitjacket on national economies through membership in the single currency , has led many people to think that europe has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for greece .
the european system is rather poses to its members of favourable exchange rates to german exporters - that german politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the countries of southern europe is faced with a problem of intrinsic productivity to germany .
the only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending-encouraged by berlin .
beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper malaise in europe linked to productivity .
following the &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by brussels - who are one reason to subsidize the french and german companies in the energy sector at the consumer &apos;s expense-european industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times more for gas than the united states .
this is a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs , as we have seen in grangemouth .
all the pay freezes in the world will not prevent the european petrochemical industry to be penalized by a cheap american shale gas .
as a result , the revolt looms , particularly in france , one of the major leaders of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite has considered the eu as a means of controlling germany and paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin no longer needs from paris as a passport for his political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in europe , leaving the french economy to scramble .
the result : the far-right party of marine le pen , the national front anti-european , has just won a crucial by-election , returning the socialists to power in third place .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the votes - a timely warning for the british labour party who reminded him that he cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically left .
marine le pen is doing with its new popularity among the white working class ?
she wants to use the european elections next year to create a single anti-monnaie and anti-european bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-european parties are doing well in these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the european parliament for the first time .
that is what i think : very soon , the anti-european sentiment and anti-monnaie unique in europe will unify and eventually kill the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be something that is more like the &quot; europe of nations ( sovereign ) &quot; free choice of general de gaulle .
germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currency .
i expect that the uk should take away from this project , and i hope that it will be up to the united states .
however , the growing interest from washington for the pacific suggests that britain will be left in the atlantic .
and scotland , in all this ?
we can choose to be a region of england ( mostly ) .
or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending promener berlin and brussels .
i think scotland could accommodate a european agreement over free on condition that we keep our own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a europe of nations rather than federal law .
otherwise , we should emulate norway and retain our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is - and it is - the anti-austerity political movement , which has been more successful in europe , having won a most spectacular in 2011 based on his opposition to the deep cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by the labour chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , and the conservative / liberal democrat coalition that followed .
now it would be ridiculous for scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .
a house fire in old
a fire that broke out friday afternoon in the old city was quickly controlled .
more than 30 firefighters were dispatched to the street h√©bert 9 .
the flames are reported in a house of three apartments spread over four floors , located behind the court of quebec .
all the tenants were absent during the fire .
the fire was extinguished an hour after the arrival of firefighters , who were likely to intervene .
as soon as our first firefighters arrived , they really saw smoke .
&quot; the alarms have succeeded , because it takes the reinforcements to attack the building , because it is glued buildings here , &quot; explained france loiselle , spokesman for the firefighters .
an investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire .
spectacular snekor jump over bogota
the athlete jhonathan florez jumped on thursday of a helicopter in bogota , the colombian capital .
equipped with a wingsuit ( a combination with wings ) , he has risen to 160 km / h over the famous monserrate sanctuary , located more than 3,000 meters above sea level , where many onlookers had gathered to watch his feat .
the end of service for the chef of the elysee
entered in the 1,500 m √âlys√©ennes kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies , the cook has climbed the ranks to become chief , nine years ago .
he served six presidents georges pompidou , french to fran√ßois hollande , nicolas sarkozy , including their places of vacations , and fed a countless number of world leaders in a virtual anonymity he breaks today , retirement at age 60 .
the man in the face , skull bare and glasses of intellectual , born on october 24 , 1953 in la fert√©-saint-aubin holds a cap of pastry .
her mother was a cook in a castle of sologne .
&quot; i &apos;m from a castle the other ! &quot; jokes bernard vaussion , who is not only the foibles of the six presidents for whom he worked , but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests .
&quot; it is still the head of state or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menu , &quot; he recalls .
&quot; mrs chirac was a little more involved , she came directly to the kitchen , &quot; to the point that it had banned women in the kitchens of the elysee !
whatever the heads of state who had a relative indifference to the terrestrial foods , &quot; they are greedy , &quot; denounces gentiment bernard vaussion .
jacques chirac certainly had &quot; an appetite a little more developed . &quot;
but with nicolas sarkozy , who had removed the cheese , the plates were returning empty !
as for fran√ßois hollande , who restored the cheese , &quot; he is someone who loves to eat &quot; and &quot; there is not much he does not like . &quot;
the current head of state , which regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign , did &quot; not request a specific plan . &quot;
bernard vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders , particularly at state dinners at the elys√©e : &quot; between 200 and 250 people in about an hour . &quot;
the night before is almost white .
these people would not understand that there will be mistakes .
the former head of the kitchens of the elysee palace , which took a glass on tuesday evening with his team , his family and friends , with an aching heart . &quot; fran√ßois hollande came to greet me . &quot;
he said of the praise .
&quot; his human side has emerged , &quot; he said .
the head will be replaced by his deputy , guillaume gomez , 35 , who is from seventeen years at the elys√©e .
a collision between two vehicles left four people injured , early friday , on route 131 , lanaudi√®re .
shortly before 4 a.m. , a motorist who was driving northbound in saint-f√©lix-de-valois , lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction .
the four occupants of the two vehicles were injured , but we do not fear for their lives .
traffic returned to normal around 6 a.m. , friday .
the mayor rob ford was botched , says a lawyer
after police confirmed they had a copy of the video to show rob ford smoking crack , clayton ruby argued that he had never seen a &quot; botched , too . &quot;
ruby told me to believe in the canadian press that the police had &quot; ignored or minimized &quot; the evidence against the mayor .
on thursday , the police arrested the friend and occasional driver rob ford , alexander lisi , 35 , and charged with extortion in connection with the video .
alexander lisi , previously convicted of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the mayor .
the police said they also found the man delivering packages to rob ford , new court documents .
ruby has described me as &quot; inexplicable &quot; that the police never searched the vehicle of rob ford or his home , or eavesdropping on his phone , arguing that the police chief bill blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor .
under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in own hands , might very well able to intercept the vehicle of rob ford , the mayor , and a search-even without a mandate .
it could also require a warrant snapshot , if deemed necessary .
the head of police has not commented , but his spokesman mark erdmann described the about ruby me &quot; obvious and desperate attempt &quot; to the media in a case that is not the case at all .
at a news conference on thursday , mr. blair said that there was nothing in this movie that can be &quot; reasonable grounds &quot; that could lead to the filing of criminal charges against the mayor .
a veteran of the armed wing of hamas was killed and another wounded by israeli tank fire in the gaza strip , a medical and security sources in gaza .
according to these sources , these activists led a surveillance operation in the border area between the palestinian territory and israel when they were hit by mortar fire from an israeli tank .
the german journalists invited to run google and yahoo
the german journalists &apos; union urged its members thursday to stop using the online services of google and yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the american and british intelligence services .
&quot; the german federation of journalists recommends to journalists to avoid until further notice the use of search engines and the courier of google and yahoo , &quot; she said in a statement .
it deems &quot; scandalous &quot; information from the washington post , that the us national security agency ( nsa ) and the government communications headquarters ( gchq ) collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two companies to synchronize their servers .
&quot; research carried out by journalists are also confidential details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them , &quot; said michael konken , chairman of the union which claims 38,000 members .
a post-pmf room of narbonne evacuated on thursday evening
on thursday night , the first meeting of a film was interrupted the mega bgtd-rmc narbonne , as a precautionary measure , following stinging throat felt by viewers .
immediately , the director of the establishment has ordered the evacuation of the room and alerted the fire brigade for a suspicious odor .
about 70 people came out of the meeting .
the people were reviewed and a full recognition of the room did nothing .
bad joke on a background of tear jet ?
or unintentional incident ?
still , the film played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers .
the room was ventilated and everything is in order .
the cinema was able to resume his duties and customers find the pleasure of the images .
on screen only .
a house explosion in gesves : a faulty heater caused the blast
the grandmother had lit a cigarette at a gas leak .
the explosion of a residential unit in gesves , who made two serious injuries on friday morning , a 52-year-old grandmother and her grandson , is due to a gas leak from a faulty heater , said on friday evening , the substitute of the king &apos;s prosecutor .
the expert sent by the prosecution that the origin of the explosion was purely accidental .
the grandmother has lit a cigarette when there was a leak and an accumulation of gas .
the life of the two victims is still committed .
the grandmother was shown by the explosion and was badly burnt .
the little boy , who was staying with his grandfather and his companion , was at his side and was burned over slightly .
&quot; the two victims were intubated and packed on site before being taken to cork university hospital , the helicopter ambulance to him , &quot; said mayor jose paulet , descended on the scene .
traumatized , the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
safe and sound , he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remains intact , while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed .
the grandfather and the tenant of the house next door , weakened by the explosion , were relocated by the chairman of the commission .
firefighters d &apos;andenne and namur and the arches police intervened .
the civil protection of crisn√©e stabilized both buildings .
a black box in your car ?
while the planners of the road network of the united states are struggling to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure in disrepair , many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above the dashboard of your car .
the devices , which record all miles flown by a motorist and transmit the information to officials , are at the centre of a controversial effort in washington and in government offices , planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main american roads .
the sector generally , without interest , of the main planning suddenly provoked a lively debate and alliances sea-states .
the libertarians joined environmental groups in order to exert pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you fly , and possibly of the road on which you drive , then use the information to prepare a draft law .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
and while members of congress can &apos;t agree on whether he should continue , several states did not wait .
they are looking at how , over the next decade , they will move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles flown .
thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes , sometimes equipped with a gps tracking system , for an experimental vir√©e .
this is really essential for our nation .
&quot; it is not as if we had a choice , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the southern california association of governments , which provides that the state began recording the miles flown by each californian motorist by 2025 .
there will be a change in how we pay these taxes .
the technology is there to do so .
the pressure comes from the fact that the highway trust fund , financed with taxes that americans pay at the pump is dry financially .
the americans are not buying as much gasoline as before .
cars can travel more miles a gallon .
the federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not increased over the past 20 years .
politicians are reluctant to increase the tax , even 1 percent , while gasoline prices are high .
&quot; the gasoline tax is simply not tenable , &quot; said lee munnich , a transportation policy specialist at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently installed plotters on 500 cars to test a system of payment to the mile .
&quot; it is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term , &quot; he said .
wonks call it user fees to the mileage .
it is not surprising that the idea for attracting urban liberals , since the fees could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
planners of california is interested in as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the ambitious legislation on global warming .
but the representative bill shuster ( r-pa . ) , chairman of the transportation committee of the house of representatives , said that he considered as the most viable alternative in the long term .
the supporters of the free market of the reason foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers a mile .
&quot; he is not just a tax spirals into a big black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president of policy at the reason foundation .
people pay more for their benefits .
the movement is also supported by two former u.s. transportation secretaries who , in a 2011 report , urged congress to move in the direction of the payment to the mile .
the u.s. senate approved a pilot project of $ 90 million last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars .
but the house killed the proposal , responding to concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or in the city .
several states and large cities are still in progress .
the most determined is oregon , which mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry the most important experience of the country .
these motorists will soon pay the state cordouan fees instead of taxes on gasoline .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
the city of new york is considering a ..
illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the u.s. east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) is studying how it could implement the change .
the concept is not a universal success .
in nevada , where about 50 motorists volunteers recently equipped their cars with a device , the drivers were worried that the government can track their movements .
&quot; the concern about big brother and stuff like that are a big problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , who heads the strategic management of the performance at the nevada department of transportation .
it is not something that people want .
at the beginning of the trial , the aclu of nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be relatively easy to convert these devices into tracking devices . &quot;
it is not necessary to build a huge technological infrastructure and cumbersome that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people &apos;s daily comings and goings .
nevada is one of the few states that are struggling now to find an affordable technology that would enable the state to know how many miles a vehicle travels , but without knowing the place or the exact time .
if we can do it , &quot; added khan , citizens will be more comfortable .
the search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small california start-ups in the name of true mileage .
originally , the company did not help motorists who pay taxes to the states .
she was looking to break into the emerging market of auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .
but the devices they tested enjoyed the main planners because they do not use the gps and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically via modem .
&quot; people will be more inclined to do that if you don &apos;t record their speed and don &apos;t find them , &quot; said ryan morrison , director general of true mileage .
big mistakes were made in pilot programs in some states .
there are far less expensive and far less intrusive methods .
in oregon , the planners trying experience by providing motorists with various choices .
they can choose a device with or without gps .
they can still choose not to have a device at all , preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state .
other states hope to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing the devices to do more , rather than not enough .
in new york city , transport officials are trying to develop a system of taxation that would also be equipped to pay parking fees , provide an insurance payment &quot; to conduct &quot; and create a set of data on the real-time speed from the other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams .
&quot; motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them , &quot; said a document on urban development .
however , some transportation planners are wondering whether the whole debate on the payment to the mile is not just a huge distraction .
the metropolitan transportation commission , the bay area of san francisco , officials say that the congress could just manage the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by raising taxes on gasoline .
a single or additional annual fee could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of fuel , so that everyone pays their fair share .
&quot; it is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when simply need aspirin , &quot; said randy rentschler , director of legislation and public affairs from the commission .
if it does this , hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned with the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
the british police issued a warrant for the extradition of assange
the british police has today issued a warrant for the extradition of wikileaks founder julian assange , who took refuge in ecuador &apos;s embassy in london and requested political asylum .
scotland yard said it had issued a &quot; notice of surrender &quot; against the 40-year-old australian , asking him to report to a police station , adding that if he did not , he would likely be arrested .
assange could be extradited to sweden on sex crime allegations , after exhausting all possible avenues under british law after the supreme court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month .
fearing that stockholm authorized his transfer to the united states , he found refuge in ecuador &apos;s embassy in london on june 19 , calling for south american countries for political asylum .
scotland yard has issued a &quot; notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station , the date and time of his choice , &quot; said a spokesman .
he continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .
the embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police .
assange fears being extradited from sweden to the united states , where he could be accused of spying , after unveiling more than 250,000 us diplomatic cables on the wikileaks website battling the secret information .
letta is confident in the longevity of his government
the italian prime minister enrico letta said that his government will take until 2015 despite the high tensions between the left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the vote in the senate to strip silvio berlusconi of his mandate .
in an interview with the daily newspaper la stampa , the centre-left leader said he &quot; fully intends &quot; to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015 .
the upper house of the italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former council president sentenced for tax fraud in august .
silvio berlusconi threatens to withdraw support to the government if the senate , where he has more opponents than supporters , addressed his removal .
but one part of his camp , grouped around the national secretary of the people of freedom ( pdl ) , angelino alfano , continues to support the government , as demonstrated on 2 october his refusal to yield to the demands of berlusconi , who is already wanted to bring down the cabinet .
for more than a year , everywhere , i see a lot of resentment from the people i meet : monstrous reassessment of their properties , deluge of fees , cost of all kinds , administrative costs .
in short , unlimited back-siphonage from our pockets .
millions of dollars could be saved squandered so much taxation respectful of those who pay .
any money forcibly abducted to taxpayers decreased their consumption and contributes to their impoverishment .
in shawinigan , despite the closure of all major companies , is not shy about spending lavishly and maintenance of lame ducks : deficit , strong cultural centre grant to the city of energy , etc ..
if these facilities are not profitable , sold to private enterprise or demolish them .
it is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that never came .
i will , however , give an honourable mention in the transformation of the old wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator , but at what cost to taxpayers ?
it is not the public to invest in such companies , but the private sector based on consumer demand .
the citizens were happy to learn that the lakes for fishing and batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
following the departure of all industries ( major water users ) and the general population decline , water use has declined significantly throughout the territory .
without wanting to say of the waste , the city will never water and harsh regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened .
in short , it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others .
i would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet .
with a gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a debt settlement .
we run for more than 40 years by cravat√©s with beautiful diplomas for most , and i do not believe that a sheep rancher is worse .
a worker dies buried under concrete blocks
a construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks , on thursday morning , in montreal .
the tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m. , the marquette street , near the intersection of the rue beaubien , in the district of rosemont-petite-patrie .
in all likelihood , the work done on the foundations were in place for some time .
a mitoyen foundation wall had been erected in recent days .
the accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools .
i was in the car and i saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke , said sylvain jean , who lives close to the site .
i landed and i went to remove large bricks that covered it .
there was only one part of his back , it &apos;s so unfortunate .
according to the authorities , the victim was a man aged in his fifties who worked for a company of formwork .
resuscitation manoeuvres were tempted by the emergency services , but without success .
the man did not survive his serious injuries .
an inspector from the health and safety of the work has been dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
the nes is an &quot; internal error &quot; and not from hackers to the outage of its site
the national security agency working in the shadows , said on friday that it was a bug that caused the outage of its public website for a few hours , and not from hackers as some had argued .
&quot; n.o.s. gov / inf / 2007 has remained elusive for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; said the spy agency in a statement by email .
the problem will be resolved this evening .
claims that the outage was due to a distributed denial of service attack &#91; dsd &#93; are false .
earlier this evening , the trackers of online servers noted that the nsa had been broken for at least six hours , and some users were still unable to access the site .
earlier , a spokesman for the nsa told abc news that the sensitive internal network of the agency was &quot; not at all &quot; compromise .
no classified information is at risk , explained the spokesman .
at least one group of hacktivists online said to be responsible for the failure of the nes by an attack .
the dsd attacks designed to flood a target website until the servers are overloaded and collapses .
the cyber-tactique is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the system &apos;s internal network .
the nsa used secret ultra , a time known as &quot; no such agency &quot; has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications monitoring programs at home and abroad - that are part of the nsa &apos;s secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the disillusioned former consultant of the nsa , edward snowden .
the growing controversy over the agency has caused much speculation that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber-op√©ration .
the delta city centre now closed
the delta hotel city centre closed its doors on thursday in montreal , after 36 years of existence .
the investment fund that owned the building has been sold to developers who would turn it into student residences .
three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel .
of these , 200 have still not found a new job .
delta promises not to let down his employees .
employers came to meet directly , it met individually with employees to assess their needs .
&quot; it support-l√† will continue for the next six months , &quot; explains the director of labour relations of delta hotels , felix bisson .
the closure of the delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market .
the investment fund that owned that b√¢tisse-l√† had choices to make .
either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate , so there was investment of tens of millions , while the competition is very fierce , there are many new hotels that have emerged in montreal .
&quot; or is he sold it to someone else , and that is what happened , &quot; explains paul arsenault , holder of the chair in tourism transat at the school of management sciences .
other hotels in montreal will also be converted in the next few months , as the crown plaza that will become a residence for elderly people .
meanwhile , four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be added in the next two years .
you want an ice fluo-3 ?
a british entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world of jellyfish .
charlie francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack .
he had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced chinese scientists recreate chemically brilliant protein .
ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the ph of the protein to make it sparkle .
chris says that , since ice cream starts to shine when she responds to the heat of the mouth , licks , it &apos;s brilliant .
charlie , the founder of the society of ice &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious , &quot; said : &quot; it &apos;s something amazing , but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g this thing costs about ¬£ 200 . &quot;
the protein that we use in the ice reacts with the ph neutral language .
so when your mouth warms the protein , the ph level rises and the ice starts to shine .
we have tested over recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everybody at halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice that i created because the luminescent jellyfish worth four times more expensive than gold .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but she is rather good taste !
the experimental approach of charlie , based in bristol , is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but her next creation , promises to be even more ambitious .
he added : &quot; i would really like to develop an invisible ice . &quot;
it is intrinsically impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that form the ice cream , but i think i will find a way to get there .
ice uses the fluorescent properties of the m√©duse synthesized by chinese scientists .

it was closed until further notice .
snowden is ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany on the issue of the american surveillance
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence services , said he was ready to travel to berlin to testify before the german parliament if the u.s. national security agency and its director keith alexander did not provide responses about their activities .
german mp hans-christian √ñbele met mr. snowden on thursday in russia , where it enjoys the right of asylum , to discuss his testimony in germany .
in a letter that the member has presented to the media in berlin on friday , mr. snowden said : &quot; although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to criminalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend . &quot;
however , the truth is not a crime .
in his letter , mr. snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the u.s. government to drop the criminal charges against him .
in the complaint filed by the u.s. department of justice , he is accused of espionage and theft of government property .
hans-peter friedrich , the german interior minister , said at the time : &quot; if mr. snowden is ready to talk to german officials , we will make that possible . &quot;
relations between the united states and germany were strained following complaints that the nsa was eavesdropping on the mobile phone of the german chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the mp who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services , said that if there was an opportunity to hear mr. snowden as a witness &quot; without putting in danger and completely ruin relations with the united states , &quot; they should take advantage of .
mr. √ñbele , german green mp , published a photo of him with mr. snowden on his twitter account .
during his visit to russia , he was accompanied by two german journalists .
mr. √ñbele said , according to the lawyer of the former nsa consultant , mr. snowden would not return to russia if he left the country .
if mr. snowden testified in germany , it would give him the assurance that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , he said .
mr. snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of persecution &quot; serious and sustained &quot; that had forced him to leave his country .
however , he said he had been encouraged by the global response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
the citizens of the world as well as senior officials - including in the united states - have found that the revelation of a mysterious system of permanent monitoring of public usefulness .
the letter suggests an offer of cooperation with the german authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
a team of biologists led by the wildlife conservation society of new york , has identified a new species of humpback dolphins off the northern coast of australia .
thibaut bouveroux , responsible for scientific mission to the centre for conservation and study of animals and marine environments ( oceamm ) returns to express this discovery and explains the lengthy process of identifying new species .
the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin √âtonne-t you ?
this is good news , but it does not surprise me .
in the past , when the species were described and identified based on morphological , anatomical and , today , the development of new tools such as genetics will allow us to improve our knowledge of the species classification .
it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology is challenging the classification or membership of a species to a genre , a family , or even an order .
at the beginning of the 19th century , morphologists classified the animals , based on morphological differences among species .
today , some of these rankings are challenged because of advances in genetics .
similarly , two very close morphologically species were identified through genetics .
this is the case of the new species , which has just been identified .
he said a decade ago , the scientific community recognized both species from this subfamily : pacific humpback dolphins and humpback whales in the atlantic .
recent analyses of four distinct species .
why is this an important discovery as the wildlife conservation society ?
from a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences , in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability .
if this population was already long been known by the researchers , they did not know that she was part of a new species , introduced only here .
therefore , if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region , we could be dealing with the extinction of a species , rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on earth .
this loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
a species is considered threatened or endangered , according to the number of people existing on earth , i.e. the stock , and the ability to recover from the neighbouring stocks .
in terms of the species sousa chinensis , whose population of the new species is discovered , its stock is automatically become smaller , making it more vulnerable .
why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals ?
marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain .
they live in homogenous habitats , open , where there are many genetic exchange between populations and individuals .
the mixing of genes to limit the creation of new species .
conversely , the more closed ecosystems promote reproductive isolation , which can lead to the creation of new species .
he should know that the marine environment is the least well known .
one prefers sending robots to mars , which lives in the mariana trench , just 11 miles from the surface of the sea .
more money is spent in the search for life on other planets and in marine research and it is high time to change that .
clive palmer claims that the mp tony abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to the system of parental leave .
mp billionaire clive palmer argues that the prime minister tony abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to the system of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system .
the mining magnate , who is contesting the payment of a carbon tax in the amount of $ 6m , argues that argument to try to remove the questions about a possible conflict .
the palmer united party could control up to four votes in the senate , which could be crucial in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes must be removed .
but mr. palmer argued that only ministers might have a conflict of interest and said that mr abbott &apos;s daughters were ready to benefit from these policies .
&quot; he will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , it will have a direct interest in the fact that she gets a leave or not , &quot; mr palmer said .
two months after his election , the electoral commission officially declared that mr palmer won the sunshine coast seat of fairfax by 53 votes after a recount .
mr. palmer has put forward the idea of an overhaul of the system of remains of votes to speed the process .
tony abbott &apos;s daughters , frances and bridget .
this election should be decided two months after the vote is completed ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why could we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your contact information in a computer , to vote immediately and to have the result at 6 : 30 the next morning ?
mr. palmer also criticized the use of pencils on paper to mark the ballot .
is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree ?
today , to have a pencil seems extraordinary .
the electoral commission has studied the options for electronic voting , and recently published a joint reflection paper with new zealand .
mr. palmer , 59 , said his political project included an international airport for the sunshine coast , and that he would assume his new responsibilities &quot; very seriously . &quot;
the performance of public duties is a question of public service .
&quot; we are not seeking reward , except for history , because we need to serve the community at a critical time , &quot; he added .
when many experts in equestrian events met in cardiff to compete for and win the trophy of the horse of the year , they knew that the competition would be fierce .
but no one expected to see win fenton kirkland , a three-year-old child .
not yet in school and only a few months after his first , the toddler and his shetland pony toffee low-hanging have during the three rounds with great ease and won first prize , leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors .
the two inseparable - that are the same size - were welcomed for the presentation , the attitude and style at the annual competition , which took place at the equestrian centre sunnybank rudry , near cardiff .
running against men and women in bowler hats , he wore his hat a little on the flat side of a relaxed way to scroll through his 2-year-old toffee pony around the track .
fenton was praised by the judges for its natural qualities of dressage , not common for a child her age .
and toffee has received very good marks for his presentation and his personality .
fenton had toffee as a gift for his third birthday last march and has since led with his shetland pony every day .
her mother donna , 30 , said : &quot; fenton and toffee are a great duo . &quot;
they went against all odds , but both won the gold cup and the rosette .
it was only the second time that he serves with toffee and we were crazy with joy that he had won .
on the runway , people who do not know him thought it was so dramatic that they wanted to be photographed with him .
the boy , from the village of nantyglo , near ebbw vale , south wales , follows in the footsteps of her aunt sharon howells , who participates in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years .
ms howells said : &quot; there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded . &quot;
he walked the entire length of the runway and , even if he seemed to be very small , he has done a wonderful job .
fenton is crazy animals - he loves horses , tractors and the rural world and two chickens .
how it began , he will surely soon to the demonstration of the horse of the year - and i am sure he will do a good performance .
a spokesman for the annual equestrian event said : &quot; fenton was only 3 years old , but he knows how to drive his pony . &quot;
they are a good team .
the judges noted that fenton and toffee did and how they paraded on the runway .
they want effective teamwork between the ponies and the horsemaster-fenton and toffee were the best on the track .
i am sure that his beautiful clothes helped fenton , he was so proud .
defence minister rob nicholson , insisted that the injured soldiers were not summarily released from the canadian armed forces , and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all the soldiers before their return to civilian life .
attacked by liberals and democrats in the house of commons , mr. nicholson assured that before their release , members of the military followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors .
all the wounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before it was ready , he said .
critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing the injured - who do not meet the rule of &quot; universal service &quot; of the army demanding that staff will be able to conduct a series of varied tasks - to reach the qualifying period of 10 years required for retirement benefits .
in particular , they cited two cases reported by the canadian press , one of them a soldier released last friday .
corporal david hawkins , a reservist from london , ontario , suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome , was discharged from the army despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed pensions .
his case came after that of corporal glen kirkland , who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed towards the exit before being ready because he did not meet the requirement of universality of service .
mr. hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave , with the plans and consultation sessions , but it was totally different as wishing to leave the ranks .
&quot; i told them i wasn &apos;t ready , &quot; he said in an interview with the canadian press on wednesday .
i asked for months if there was a way for me to stay , and they said no .
since the beginning of the major battles in afghanistan , the army is struggling to determine what latitude they can award to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks , but who are not fit to fight .
under current rules , the soldiers seriously injured have up to three years to recover .
if they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments , they may be forced to leave the military .
data presented last year in parliament show that among 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons , 199 had not reached the required length of service for pension benefits .
the liberal spokesman for veterans , jim karygiannis , requested on wednesday the reinstatement of corporal hawkins , while democrat jack harris called for an immediate end to &quot; this shameful practice . &quot;
air raid against military installations in syria
according to the lebanese army , israeli aircraft entered lebanese airspace on wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
a shipment of short-range surface-to-air missiles his ipc-8 have been targeted and destroyed .
this new israeli air raid on syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the israeli daily newspaper haaretz ) has been confirmed by both israel and syria .
the raid took place in circumstances virtually identical to the one that took place on july 5 : at the time , it is also an anonymous american official who had confirmed to cnn an israeli attack , this time shore-to-sea yakhont missiles , supplied by russia in damascus .
israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing president assad to respond .
life imprisonment for a former chinese vice governor
a former vice-governor of jilin province in northeast china , was sentenced on friday to life in prison for corruption .
expelled from the communist party in july 2012 , tian xueren was accused of having received more than 19 million yuan in bribes , the official chinese media .
between 1995 and 2001 , the governor , who was also the president of the jilin bank , a public institution , has helped companies and officials to get contracts , loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts , said the first intermediate court in beijing on his microblog .
president xi jinping , who took office in march , has made the fight against corruption a national priority , arguing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the communist party .
if the head of state promised that justice would be so inflexible with the powerful &quot; tigers &quot; and &quot; flies &quot; - junior officers-only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted , including former executives from oil giant petrochina .
the most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the pcc in chongqing , bo xilai , sentenced to life imprisonment in september for corruption and abuse of power after he referred to the highest office in the state .
but the government has no intention to reform the system of combating corruption , for example by creating an independent body of the party .
bombardier &apos;s profit drops , while shipments and orders for aircraft are receding
bombardier inc . , aerospace and rail manufacturer , reported a fall of 15 % of its net income on thursday , under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its rail division .
bombardier , based in montreal , did not provide any flight test data for its new cseries aircraft nor information on whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial service until next september .
after the maiden flight of the test plane about a month and a half , he stole only three times , and the question was raised whether the test phase was on track .
the results were not up to the expectations and stock prices fell by 8 % in the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , an analyst with national bank financial , lowered on thursday its rating from &quot; outperform &quot; to &quot; sector performance &quot; due to the potential upside of the stock market in the next quarter or the next two quarters .
&quot; while the decline in aircraft deliveries had been largely anticipated , we are very disappointed by the profit margin in the transport division , &quot; cameron doerksen said in a note to clients .
we believe that bombardier will record new orders for its cseries aircraft , as the flight test program .
however , if no new order is announced in the next few months , we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the cseries family of aircraft will catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test plane was unveiled in march and flew for the first time in september after months of delay .
but the number of firm orders for the c-series aircraft is small so far , up from 177 . it seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company &apos;s assertions regarding energy efficiency and potential cost savings of the new airliner .
currently , the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators .
pierre beaudoin , president and chief executive , is convinced that bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial service of the first plane .
the leaders also reassured analysts and media on thursday , saying that the program progressed according to schedule .
&quot; the test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected , &quot; mr. beaudoin said during a conference call , adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the time out of the plane .
each manufacturer plans in different ways .
we had decided to proceed with a first flight and to provide an update , and it is what we have done .
it will be repeated throughout the flight programme .
the second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks , the others will follow soon after , the company said .
however , analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first client to make stealing a cseries plane just 12 months after its maiden flight .
bombardier said it was assessing the timing of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months .
&quot; this slow flight tests-although it appears to be consistent with internal schedule of bombardier-reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; mr. doerksen said .
in the third quarter ended september 30 , bombardier &apos;s net income fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , compared to $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , a year earlier .
adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents .
revenues declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion .
analysts were expecting a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.56 , according to thomson reuters / / s .
the fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , compared with a year earlier .
the net orders fell to 26 aircraft from 83 .
the delay in the aeronautics division accounted for 32.9 billion as of september 30 , a figure unchanged from december 31 of the previous year .
&quot; in aviation , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the small number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing , &quot; mr. beaudoin said .
the aeronautics revenues decreased by 13 % to reach $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest railway builder , said that the revenue from this division had increased by nearly 11 % to 2.1 billion .
the order book of the transport division totalled 32.6 billion as of september 30 , a slight increase compared to the december 31 of the previous year .
the margins of the transport division suffered problems with implementation on a few large contracts .
the leaders announced that new evidence would be provided during the fourth quarter .
the stock prices of bombardier , which also announced that patrick pichette , chief financial officer of google inc , would sit on the board of directors , fell by 8.5 % to 4.83 canadian dollars on thursday afternoon .
the brazilian company embraer sa , a third aircraft manufacturer in the world and bombardier &apos;s closest rival , reported on thursday a drop of 10 % of its quarterly profit .
the kenyan press is outraged by the controversial media law
&quot; it &apos;s a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the following question : what is to prevent parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? , &quot; said the newspaper , challenging the draft law and asking that he be declared unconstitutional .
&quot; this law is very draconian and punitive , and we reject it , &quot; explained cyrus kamau , general manager of capital group-owner of capitalfm , one of the radio stations and independent news web sites , the most respected in kenya .
he said that the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased because he is an extension of the government &quot; and that the restrictions on the content and advertising would affect kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president will listen to us , and we ask him to reject the bill and refer it back to parliament , &quot; he added .
according to the newspaper the star , the new draft law will allow the government to have &quot; control over the media . &quot; the standard , said that democracy and freedom of opinion in kenya &quot; suffered a hard blow &quot; and criticised the draft law as &quot; draconian &quot; .
the adoption of the draft law comes at the same time , a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed islamists in the westgate shopping center last september .
the kenyan media have raised the ire of authorities by broadcasting images of cctv cameras on which the troops deployed at the scene of the attack supposedly para12 luxury shopping center .
the head of the police , david kimaiyo , responded by convening two journalists and a media manager for questioning , although the invitation was withdrawn following an outcry in the media .
under the new draft law , the media will be subject to fines of up to 20 million kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &quot; canceled &quot; or no longer able to receive official press accreditation .
the tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he did not pay his fine .
according to the daily nation , &quot; even one fine enough to paralyse most fm stations . &quot;
he also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the &quot; lively blogosphere &quot; of kenya .
reducing to silence the media , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote mutuma mathiu , a journalist for the nation , describing the kenyan media as a key source of control in public life .
&quot; left to themselves , the politicians would put the country into bankruptcy and send us back to hunting and gathering . &quot;
kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the population in the past .
in may , they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the national commission in charge of salaries and have re-established their exorbitant salaries of about 532 000 shillings a month tax-free - who are among the highest in the world .
two cavers from 23 and 27 were missing a chasm in the dent de crolles since thursday evening , it was reported on friday to the relief of the d &apos;is√àre speleo-adventure .
they were located this vendredi-apr√®s-midi ..
the two men , one a veteran and the other not , went underground on thursday about 9 : 30 p.m. to a crossing of the dent de crolles , located in the municipality of saint-pierre-de-chartreuse .
there was no news of them since , said the same source .
&quot; the cave should have been out at around 5 a.m. , &quot; said thierry larribe , technical adviser to the emergency caving in charge of the relief organization .
dozens of people on the spot
a dozen rescuers , ten members of the french rescue speleo-adventure civilians as well as police , riot police and firefighters were on the scene .
at the end of the afternoon on friday , the two cavers were located .
&quot; it &apos;s a different group of spelunkers who found them to be exhausted , but in good health in the cavity , forwarded the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network , &quot; explains the dauphin√© .
the two soldiers of the 13th battalion of alpine hunters chamb√©ry , were found &quot; exhausted , but not injured . &quot;
they got lost in the network , returned to their not awaiting rescue , said the prefecture .
non-recharging , they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening .
a capita d &apos;aubervilliers launches his party in the suburbs
don &apos;t mistake .
in the spirit of abdel-malik djermoune , its founder , the &quot; party of the suburbs &quot; is not only to commuters .
i chose a map of france as a logo , justifies t-il .
when i speak of the suburbs , i address to all those who are excluded from the great national family .
nevertheless , his project , presented on thursday at a press conference in his home town of aubervilliers , was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism , that great cultural melting pot that characterizes the city .
my proposal no . ¬∞ 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism , &quot; he says .
abdel-malik djermoune , 50 , territorial secretary , claimed today as &quot; 100 % apolitical &quot; even if he has not always been neutral .
an activist in 2002 alongside jean-pierre chev√©nement , he then supported locally dominique de villepin between 2010 and 2011 .
i know that the values of equality that i advocate in my program are attached to the left , but if the right people are willing to support me , i listen to them , too , &quot; he says .
there is only the extremist parties that i not speak .
in addition to multiculturalism , abdel-malik djermoune has built its program-available on the internet-from many themes expected to suburban residents and especially to young people : the right to vote for foreigners , the legalisation of cannabis , the most in 16 years , the rehabilitation of caretaker ...
yet to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene . &quot; for the municipal elections in 2014 , it might be fair , &quot; he says . &quot;
it is a question of time and money .
the advantage of the suburbs should still be represented at d &apos;aubervilliers through my candidacy and i hope in other cities .
abdel-malik djermoune ensures already have seven heads of list in metropolitan france and martinique .
&quot; and the messages of support i receive from yesterday does not emanate from any of the suburbs , &quot; he says .
tribute paid to veterans in menton
at the heart of the cemetery of trabuquet , civil authorities , religious and military , and many patriotic associations , reported on friday afternoon , a tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars .
wreaths were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the mayor jean-claude guibal and different personalities .
foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa would have to pass a test of &quot; authenticity . &quot;
the government is currently studying the possibility of setting up a test of &quot; authenticity &quot; for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa when he is considering extending the measures of repression .
the test , if adopted , would be implemented according to a criterion aimed at preventing 457 visas being used to fill unskilled positions or as a backdoor method to bring his family and friends in australia .
a government discussion paper was unveiled today as the labour mep maxine mckew denounced the government speech on foreign workers , saying that it could offend australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; the sensational declarations on &quot; foreigners returning at the end of the line &quot; and &quot; jobs for australians first &quot; are an unpleasant return when the unions demanded a protected labour market , &quot; she told the australia india institute today .
historically , this meant that the work of white should be protected - and i would not be surprised that some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact .
the paper reported the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former immigration minister chris bowen .
the immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who was in sri lanka to meet with officials to discuss the trafficking of human beings , has implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being under consideration .
if the criterion of &quot; authenticity &quot; was adopted , a visa applicant could be checked to find out &quot; if the job offer is genuine if the candidate is a relationship or a staff member of the owner or the person in the company that sponsors . &quot;
companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them , have had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers actually employed hundreds .
meanwhile , a sri lankan asylum seeker , 35 , died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to christmas island this week .
the distraught son , aged nine , went to australia with him and found some solace after the death of his father on wednesday to an adult cousin who was also on board .
the man was transferred by the australian authorities to christmas island hospital , where he died .
challenging the right to abortion in texas
a federal court of appeal reinstated in texas certain restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that were blocked by a judge of first instance this week .
this means that a law adopted in july in the state and significantly on the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
the ruling by the court of appeal means that doctors who carry out abortions must have a &quot; privilege of admission &quot; to local hospitals .
the privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , by virtue of its status as a member hospital to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to issue a diagnosis or treatment .
abortion advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the clinics in the state because the clinics failed to get this &quot; privilege of admission &quot; for their practitioners .
in total , it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be denied access to these institutions .
on monday , a magistrate had said on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional .
but the texas attorney general , republican greg abbott , who is vying for the position of governor , asked the court of appeal to overturn the verdict of the trial court that blocked enforcement of the law .
a full hearing on the matter is scheduled for january .
oracle shareholders angered by the salary of ellison
a majority of oracle shareholders voted on thursday against the proposal to pay for the founder and chief executive larry ellison , based on the financial performance of its group .
the vote is not binding , but just to tarnish the image of larry ellison , third world just nimbed victory from his boat in the america &apos;s cup .
the billionaire still holds 25 % of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago .
last year , ellison suffered a negative vote on his compensation .
the boss of oracle has waived a bonus of $ 1.2 million for the fiscal year 2013 ended in may due to the poor performance of the group , which has failed to achieve its growth targets , but he collected about $ 77 million in stock options .
his salary is only a symbolic dollar .
on the whole the year 2013 d√©cal√© , oracle &apos;s net income grew by 3.5 % , while the stock market jumped 27.5 % , go the s &amp; p index c-500 who took 24 % at the same time .
the testing by the pasteur institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have tested negative , announced the ministry of health .
he said that &quot; the two cases identified in may 2013 are the only two confirmed cases in france so far . &quot;
on tuesday , the 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being achieved , after returning from saudi arabia , a country where the disease has already done some 50 deaths .
the 22-year-old top model does not begin his career in cinema through the back door .
the director lars von trier has chosen to embody charlotte gainsbourg young in his next film , the nymphomaniac .
this pornographic tragedy reeling in eight chapters that will come in two phases ( 1 and 8 january 2014 ) , the erotic memories of a 40-year-old man addicted to sex since his adolescence .
the likeness of stacy martin with her older sister is striking : a silhouette of twig , a diaphanous skin and b.e.f. &apos; s origins .
not to mention a certain taste for risk : those who did not hesitate to pose nude on the glossy paper will appear in more nonsulfur situations on the big screen .
an excerpt from nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the web : stacy martin appears in bed and full ecstasy with shia labeouf .
if the filmmaker provocateur has asked his players to put their modesty in the closet , he resorted to the x for the sex scenes the most daring , before merging all the bodies numerically : above the waist is the star ; below , the liner .
bj√∂rk &apos;s charlotte gainsbourg , nicole kidman , lars von trier has used to push his players to their limits , always for the better .
stacy martin did not talk about it .
five years ago , my father was removed from the world of the living .
at the beginning i denied his death , i was talking to him at present ,
i was so afraid of forgetting , or rather i didn &apos;t know how i am going to keep on going .
there is no recipe for moving the wall of invisible and reunited with his family .
then signs have emerged .
the first time it has been a very strong sense of his presence on the passenger seat while i was driving .
another time , a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch its shows that leaves me more , raised on the night table .
it is the image of my father smiled with me in my day-to-day actions .
our mother died after his gruelling fight against cancer .
at least that is what i thought when i found his body tensed vacuum on the hospital bed , crumpled linen .
similarly , his funeral was a bitter farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin .
i thought that it was a party .
little by little , through small diurnal and nocturnal appearances , a little shy , a little erased , it quickly turned back in my mind , as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in mourning .
and then , it is revealing to me my own facets that i had not yet collected , masked by my relationship with her .
so i learned and understood that i had lost any person from my mother , but simply a woman i didn &apos;t know really , a woman who embodied this person , during his stay in the life .
in dying , this woman had a perfect life and released the person i loved , and i found myself , and full .
a detour in the path of my life is the most unexpected and the most beautiful .
it is a privilege to know that people loved never leave us .
i look like my father , &quot; on the inside as on the outside . &quot;
they always told me .
i never believed it at the time .
i had difficult relations with him until he becomes old , sick .
there , i was scared of him and i love him .
one day , he died .
for a long time , he accompanied me : when i stopped smoking when i was afraid when i was wrong ...
he spoke to me , encouraged me constantly , he lived on my body .
i saw his hands in mine , i paid him with my body .
but it was never intrusive .
i was able to have a personal life .
he left me my privacy .
it lasted long and then one day he left .
finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , supported , advised .
i do not know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible .
my parents are over , but i constantly feel about me .
every event , every moment of my life makes me feel their presence , because i always refer : what would you have said ? what would they think ? - they have done ?
i constantly dream of them , perhaps not all nights , but several times a week .
i often dream of the last moments that i share with them before it is too late , only , there is always something that prevents me from doing this time .
i wake often anxious when it happened to me and i feel deeply for their absence .
sometimes i have dreams to the contrary and are part of my history and , indeed , they continue to live and to share my life .
on the eve of my ultrasound , where i had to know the sex of my baby , i dreamed that i woke , i hissais out of bed , my father was waiting for me on the stage and i smiled and welcomed a baby boy .
the next day , i had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep , indicating to me that he shared with joy .
and , of course , it was a small boy in my belly .
i liked to share this moment with him , and i am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death .
exactly five years ago , my grandmother died from cancer .
a year ago , it was on a trip with my family in cuba .
that is to say the shock of his disappearance caused the youngster that i was at the time .
in spite of everything , i realized my grief quickly enough .
but it continues to influence my life , especially in the moments when i find myself in trouble or when i have to take important decisions .
learn arabic and interested in the middle east , to be a master in a great school , were not , with hindsight , trivial choices .
in fact , i often heard him speak arabic in my childhood , and talk of morocco , where she had lived for decades - before returning to france at the time of independence .
the values she taught me are always present , so sometimes i think about how she would like me , whether at a given time .
the same goes for my attitude : i try to match the generosity and goodness of spirit of that which was a fervent believer .
now , i feel like a daily presence , a benevolent soul , an uplifting spirit .
i see her eyes on me .
my mother died there nineteen years now .
dead after speaking by telephone .
i went through all the phases : incomprehension , anger , pain , crying that activate only , anywhere , anytime , in unusual places , incongruous moments .
then , time has eased the pain .
only the lack , so empty without a response , it needs it , to assign me , reassure me at the bottom of its sweetness .
nevertheless , it is there , silent presence , she is there and watching me .
every morning , i see his eyes worried arise on me , i see the rings that add to her eyes , the wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes , which folds the front the concern .
my mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror .
and every morning , i look away .
my wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43 .
one feels for its protection , nothing terrible can happen to us .
it was his promise to his bed of pain , then it was slowly relearned to smile and pronounce her name is no longer taboo , but a comfort .
of course , i talk to him in the hollow of the night when the absence is too badly , it is in my dreams when morale is a little achieved .
we also feel encouraged and protected in difficult moments , the passage of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to remain on the path mapped out for us .
if you liked to be very strong , the absence can you tear the hearts and memories .
in some ways , the loved one becomes your inner energy .
i lost my father on 22 august 2008 as a result of an asbestos-related cancer .
i was very close to him , i always acted according to what he was thinking or what he appreciated .
i could not attend his funeral , and three weeks after his death , i gave birth to a boy .
if i have my beliefs may be different , i always wonder if my actions are consistent with his view of things .
i also had problems in my work for these beliefs .
for me , it is impossible to go in an opposite direction , i do not sleep , and i still wonder what they will think .
i do not know if i adopted it or if i &apos;m just like him : is it genetic ?
in any case , it will always be my reference .
it was a bit like an alter-ego , there was no need to talk among ourselves .
in short , he is there on a daily basis .
i feel his presence , and that makes me happy .
here almost thirty years that my husband has died at the age of 33 .
i was 28 years old and our son .
the huge penalty to me now is , of course , is muted , but it is always close to me .
very often it &quot; landed &quot; in my dreams , so precise , so alive that alarm clock i am sad to see that it was only a dream .
the other night , he asked me if i was okay , i told him no , i say &quot; i &quot; but a voice so real that i woke up with a jolt , anxious and i turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere , convinced that it would happen .
i still live in the same house , and often , i feel , and i turn to see if he is not there , i know it &apos;s him and talk to him .
in all the pieces i feel his presence , and that makes me happy .
for anything in the world i cannot leave this house where we were pleased and or its spirit lives with me .
i am 58 years old , i always lived alone since his departure , it is and will remain the love of my life .
i would like to clarify that i am a sociable with responsibility , i laugh and i sang , i go out , i &apos;m a grandmother , i have lots of friends , but my heart and my soul belong to him , and i never spoke to him except with my son , and i never go to the cemetery .

for its part , the israeli army said the target of the operation was initially a section of a tunnel dug into israeli territory from the palestinian enclave , discovered on 7 october and intended , according to the military , to &quot; terrorist activities . &quot;
hamas claimed responsibility for the use of tunnels in order to combat israel , adding that the aim was to kidnap israeli soldiers to exchange them for palestinian prisoners .

pitcairn wants to create the world &apos;s largest marine reserve
pitcairn island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world , announced on thursday the newspaper les nouvelles de tahiti , citing information from radio australia .
this island , east of the gambier archipelago ( french polynesia ) , is the last british territory in the south pacific , halfway between new zealand and chile .
this territory is 47 km , while there were three other small islands nearby .
he is british , since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the bounty , episode in the history of the british navy , which led to three hollywood adaptations .
dozens of people , most of them descendants of the mutineers of the bounty , still inhabit pitcairn , and their revenues depend on 95 % of the generosity of london .
the island council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago , 836.000 km that correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
an assistant to the mayor of the island went to london to ask britain to validate the request .
mike warren , the mayor of pitcairn , believes that the creation of such a zone would be a first step towards more fiscal autonomy for the island .
the project must be accepted by the british governor of pitcairn , residing in new zealand , and by the british government .
the creation of a marine reserve would allow the uk to enshrine these 836.000 km , but only if we have the means to monitor , which is not the case .
there is no airport in pitcairn , which makes it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring of the zone , and there is no port where the placement of military ships .
as for france , it must now undertake the very costly aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million sq km of the eez of french polynesia , pitcairn &apos;s neighbour .
greece : two killed in a shooting near a local neo-nazi party
two people were killed and another was seriously injured friday night by shots fired by two people who were aboard a motorcycle that passed in front of a room of the neo-nazi party golden dawn in the western suburbs of athens , a police source .
the police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation .
some greek media reported that golden dawn members had argued that the victims were their local guards .
the injured person was immediately hospitalized , according to the same source .
officers from the anti-terrorist unit were dispatched to the central avenue in the suburb of neo iraklio , where the incident took place and have cordoned off the area .
the incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six members of the golden dawn , whose leader and founder of the party , for involvement in a &quot; criminal organization &quot; as part of a campaign against the party after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members .
the parents of a georgia teenager who died in unusual circumstances , believe that their son was murdered
the parents of a georgia teenager , whose body was found in a rolled wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his school , believe that their son was killed , said the family &apos;s lawyer on thursday .
kendrick johnson of valdosta , georgia , was found on january 11 , stuck in a carpet standing behind the bleachers of the school &apos;s gymnasium .
sheriff &apos;s investigators in lowndes county concluded that johnson had died in unusual circumstances , but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these conclusions .
&quot; they are absolutely certain that their son was murdered , &quot; said benjamin crump , the lawyer representing kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , on foxnews.com .
they never thought that he was dead , as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff .
&quot; they think that it defies logic , the laws of physics and common sense , &quot; said crump .
they are confident that these findings were delivered only to cover the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; they sent their son to school with a binder and is paid in a mortuary bag , &quot; he added .
u.s. attorney michael moore said on thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of johnson , pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered .
what is the cause of death ?
his death is the result of a criminal act ?
moore spoke at a news conference on thursday afternoon .
i will follow the facts wherever they lead .
my goal is to discover the truth .
&quot; i consider that there is a sufficient basis &quot; to open an official investigation , he said .
moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that johnson had died of &quot; positional asphyxia . &quot;
however , a second autopsy has identified another cause of death , according to moore .
&quot; several questions deserve an answer or confirmation , &quot; he said .
moore added that he has evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of johnson , he will ask the fbi to carry it out .
the representative of the office of sheriff in lowndes county was not available for comment when contacted on thursday .
a georgia judge ordered on wednesday the authorities to hand over all the cctv recordings that investigators had examined .
the teenager &apos;s parents said they hoped that the video images contain clues about the circumstances of her death .
the former chief of the gestapo buried in a jewish cemetery
m√ºller , who disappeared at the end of the second world war but never found him , was buried in a common grave in a jewish cemetery in berlin , says the leader of the german resistance memorial , professor johannes tuchel in bild .
m√ºller did not survive to the end of the war .
&quot; his body was buried in 1945 in a common grave in the jewish cemetery in berlin , &quot; he told the mass circulation daily based on archival material .
this revelation , 68 years after the end of the nazi regime of adolf hitler , would address one of the great enigmas of the post-war era .
the german secret service , the bnd , as well as during the summer of 1949 , m√ºller in karlovy vary , then czechoslovakia , according to a document obtained by bild .
the secret service is totally wrong .
&quot; from august 1945 , m√ºller &apos;s body was found in a grave near the former provisional ministry of aviation of the reich by a commando , &quot; according to mr. tuchel .
he was wearing &quot; a uniform . &quot;
&quot; in the inner pocket left included his service with a photograph , &quot; he says .
bild also published a document from the mayor of the district of mitte district of berlin , indicating that he was buried in the jewish cemetery in the district .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said he was shocked by the revelation .
one of the most brutal nazi sadists to be buried in a jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste .
&quot; one crowd estimate24 of the memory of the victims , &quot; he threw up in the newspaper .
heinrich m√ºller is part of the major figures of the third reich who were never caught .
he took part in the wannsee conference in january 1942 , which decided on the &quot; final solution &quot; and under his command was adolf eichmann , head of the &quot; logistics &quot; of the extermination of the jews , sentenced to death and executed in israel in 1962 .
egypt calls on the first freely elected president sworn in
mohamed morsi swore the oath of office , but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in egypt .
the islamist mohamed morsi promised a &quot; new egypt , &quot; when he took the oath of the presidency , becoming the first freely elected president and successor to hosni mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier .
at his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , mr morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the fifth head of state to egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago .
he was sworn in in front of the 18 judges in black robes of the court whose building located at the edge of the nile was built to resemble an egyptian temple .
&quot; we aspire to a better tomorrow , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; said president morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television .
&quot; today , the egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life ‚Äì absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said morsi , a 60-year-old engineer trained in the united states , from the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarding the building where mr. morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time , followed by a small convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and scored from the presidential pomp of the mubarak years , traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow for the passage of his convoy in the busy streets linking the city centre to the south suburbs .
regarded as the &quot; spare wheel &quot; charismatic muslim brotherhood , his personal prestige has expanded considerably since its victory and his speech on friday in which he tried to portray himself as the only candidate of the islamists , but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian president mubarak .
&quot; egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern , &quot; said mohamed morsi , in a blue suit and red tie , addressing the judges present in the room decorated with wood when he was sworn in .
later , mr. morsi went to cairo university , where he delivered his inaugural speech .
it was officially welcomed by a military band that played the national anthem while he stood at attention .
field marshal hussein tantawi attended the ceremony .
upon his arrival , he was greeted by the chant &quot; the people and the army , hand in hand ... &quot; intoned by thousands of people gathered in the auditorium of the university .
founded in 1908 , and a former stronghold of the secular education , the university of cairo later became a stronghold of islamist student groups in the 1970s .
mr morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , where the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian regime of hosni mubarak last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council , which replaced the former president ousted , the dispossessed .
but by agreeing to formally swear an oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is bowing to the will of the military by showing that the power struggle is not over .
mr. morsi &apos;s speech on tahrir square has been accompanied by dramatic populist gestures .
aircraft manufacturers are arguing over the width of the seats so that large orders are at stake
the dispute has raged between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in tourist class on long-haul flights , paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the dubai airshow , which takes place a month .
the conflict is about the width of seats on long-haul flights to passengers in economy class - which is not always the most courted by the airlines , but the space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft made by airbus sas and boeing co ..
this week , airbus has called on the aviation industry to develop a standard for imposing a siege of at least 18 inches ( 45.72 cm ) in economic classes , but its big american rival boeing said that it should be up to the airlines to decide .
the dispute erupted as manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft , hoping a record of orders at the event , which will be held from november 17 to 21 .
how the seats will be placed at the back of the plane - in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats in front - is critical to the economic performance of the &quot; mini-jumbo segment . &quot;
boeing said that its &quot; 777 &quot; refitted to accommodate economy class 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide and will be configured with 10 seats per row .
airbus said that the competing version of its a350 will carry in economy class seat 350 people in 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9 .
the aviation giants often exchanging blows on technical issues by advertising in the press .
today , airbus is appealing directly to the public before the dubai airshow , where the 777 x should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
it was discovered recently in what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant , &quot; would you ? &quot;
&quot; boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats in the regional turboprop aircraft , &quot; said john leahy , airbus commercial director .
as dietary habits change , people grow , but the seats on planes have not dramatically changed .
between the beginning of the 1970s , when the jumbo boeing 747 has defined the modern long-haul trip , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average american from 40 to 49 has increased by 10 % , according to data from the u.s. department of health .
the size of the average american in the 21st century is 39.7 inches , according to the american health statistics .
airbus said that its rival is clinging to a concept that dates to the 1950s , when the circumference of the freshly device called &quot; jet set &quot; was more closely .
airbus says it has commissioned a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53 % .
boeing disputes the figures from airbus with regard to the width of the seats and maintains that it is not the builders to decide how the airlines cut ticket prices and equipment .
he also said that the study shows that the cabin experience depends not only on the width of the seats .
&quot; it really is to provide the flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think they need to conduct their activities , &quot; said kent walld , in charge of the boeing passenger satisfaction .
they do not want to be told what they will be profitable .
they know their business better than anyone .
for passengers , it is better to have a certain freedom of movement , but for suppliers is increasingly an issue that could affect their performance .
behind the dispute lies a race for orders for aircraft at an estimated cost of at least $ 700,000 to the market price in the coming decades , enough to tip the balance of american and european exports .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , the seating configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices .
airbus and boeing both claim a performance by headquarters in their latest models of twin-engine long-haul 20 % higher than that of the market leader in this segment , the boeing 777-300er of 365 seats .
the performance announced by boeing will partly depend on the comparison between the 777 x configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin set in rows of 9 .
the gain in terms of unit costs is small compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row .
&quot; boeing is going to be able to squeeze more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , director of passenger comfort in the european aircraft manufacturer airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing m777 suggests that many passengers were in favour of a more dense configuration , which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
&quot; a seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for the passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said the expert in interior cabins mary kirby , founder and editor in chief of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing does not provide seats , but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose .
sellers of aircraft that circle the world prevail , even with a metre to verify the competing configurations .
while extolling comfortable aircraft , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with higher density configurations for low-cost airlines and regional travel .
airbus is offering the a350 configured with 10 seats per row , but says he has not yet sold .
until recently , airbus highlighted the need for greater customization of booths offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern appliances , experts say it is unlikely that his call for the aviation industry to develop a standard for the seats , but that he could forget the wave of sales of m777 x .
guillaume nicloux &apos;s adaptation of the novel by denis diderot boasts a remarkable artistic directorate and a detailed reconstruction of the era , but it is also more difficult than it should be .
in france the years 1760 , it tells the grim story of suzanne , a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family .
when she is rebellious , she faced the cruelty of a mother superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another .
the film never remits in the prurience and sensationalism , and that is the problem .
the conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public .
the musical comedy , this beast from the scene
classic , sophisticated , popular , in english or french , the song and dance productions take flight .
after broadway and london , paris finally found his voice .
it is a revolution : the french musical is a successful genre .
long , notre-dame de paris to mozart opera rock , most attempts to ridicule has floundered .
and success as a cabaret or miserable wore the halo of mystery .
the arrival of jean-luc choplin , ch√¢telet and entertainment to mogador .
today , these two scenes are handled securities as successful tubes .
the first takes , this christmas , his excellent my fair lady and announces to the world premiere of &quot; an american in paris . &quot;
in mogador , &quot; &quot; beauty and the beast &quot; could well be one of the success stories of the season .
in other scenes , the musical performances as &quot; 1789 &quot; , &quot; les amants de la bastille &quot; and small musicals such as &quot; disco &quot; or &quot; life and times &quot; match the success and quality .
patrick niedo , author of the book &quot; stories of musicals &quot; and speaker at the chatelet theatre , analyzes the reasons for success so hard won .
how to change the french musicals ?
the offer is multiplied .
first , there is the &quot; musical events &quot; that evolve to producers ...
some use of beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789 , the lovers of the bastille .
others are a bond of fifteen years ago under the pretext that can be used for just about anything &quot; when matt pokora as headliners .
later , it was the musicals with sumptuous ch√¢telet productions that make us relive the golden age of broadway and discover the world of stephen sondheim , the greatest living composer .
stage entertainment popularizes musicals of the anglo-saxon variety adapting them in french .
the independent french producers are trying a breakthrough .
but current projects such as &quot; rent , &quot; &quot; kiss of the spider woman &quot; or &quot; spring awakening &quot; to be funded .
do we have enough artists such as broadway singer , playing and dancing ?
in paris , where eight musical performances in a season , it &apos;s a great year .
we have 200 talented artists who turn projects projects .
in the united states , the cradle of the musical comedy is very different .
young people are trained in these trades in many schools .
jobs are plentiful among the regional theatres , touring broadway , on off-broadway ...
the talent pool is so that the number of vacancies .
why do the tours in the province as successful ?
with the exception of the opera , the province remains the poor relation of culture in france .
few plays , touring and is often the scene of boulevard for adults and young adults .
the musical performances are filling the gap .
it is these same young people who love reality programming and what it produces as ephemeral stars ...
propose beautiful young men ( often talented ) at the head of a musical performance is the assurance of an appetite for these young girls and often their entire family .
the facebook pages of these performances are cleverly held by professionals who replied to questions .
these performances are very expected when they arrive at a zenith of province .

the show is designed to enter all the major halls of france in the same form as in paris .

ben greenman : tenth anniversary of the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
one could say that new york city is the birthplace of the stand-up in america : there are almost 100 years old , the vaudeville actor frank fay , who held the role of master of ceremonies at the palace theatre on broadway , began to tell jokes , directly in front of the public , the tone of the conversation .
the innovation of fay has endured over the years , to be repeated more recently by the new york comedy festival .
created and overseen by caroline hirsch , the founder of the stand-up club carolines , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 performances in small clubs and theatres .
&quot; most of the stars have emerged in the carolinas , and have been very successful , until they became too famous for playing in a club , &quot; hirsch said .
we created this festival in order to be able to continue to work with them .
this year &apos;s event will see the participation of wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher and the presentation of &quot; stand up for heroes , &quot; an evening of music and comedy to benefit veterans , held at madison square garden , which will be present , among others , bruce springsteen , jon stewart , roger waters and bill cosby .
the festival has grown , as the world of comedy .
several of the artists participating in the festival this year passed through non-traditional channels , for example , shows small television channels such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll has appeared on stage in a sitcom about a cable channel ( &quot; the league &quot; on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lusty fxx chain ) and now has his own sketch show on comedy central .
jenny slate in the tv show &quot; saturday night live &quot; and is part of the cast of the series &quot; parks and recreation , &quot; but it is still best known for his series of viral video &quot; marcel the shell with shoes on . &quot;
kroll and slate , and other young actors at the singular voice ( the pessimistic surreal anthony jeselnik , the ironic advocate for racial justice w. kamau bell ) , are pure products of the decentralized world of american comedy .
one of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview : david steinberg talking with larry david .
steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but he became a director of cinema and television , as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy .
between 2005 and 2007 , he hosted a show on tv land called &quot; sit down comedy with david steinberg . &quot;
the meeting takes place at the city hall in downtown manhattan .
&quot; the city is definitely in the comic dna of all the work of larry , &quot; steinberg said .
he told me that , when he was here , sometimes it down an alley between two buildings and said well , if i lose all my money , maybe i &apos;ll live here .
discovery of a drug tunnel between the u.s. and mexico with its own track
one of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the united states and mexico , with its own lighting , ventilation and electrical rails , was discovered .
u.s. authorities have described the tunnel as 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated and secret passages that they had never seen .
the tunnel , zigzagging on an equivalent length of about six football fields long , connects warehouse near tijuana , mexico , to san diego , in the united states .
the area is full of indefinable warehouses , which allows you to hide the trucks loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was closed before the drugs are going unnoticed emerged , authorities said .
authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel , according to court records .
three men who , according to the authorities , working as drivers , were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell .
they face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life in prison if they are convicted .
in nogales , arizona , traffickers exploit vast underground drainage canals .
the tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in san diego since 2006 .
some of the biggest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana crop in central mexico in october , posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
in 2010 , the authorities found a passage about 700 yards of tracks that started in the kitchen of a house in tijuana and went up to two san diego warehouses .
syria has destroyed its production capacity of chemical weapons , said the oversight body
syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with poisonous gas , said the international body monitoring of chemical weapons on thursday , while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
a group of syrian activists also said on thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country in nearly three years .
the announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline .
november 1 deadline set by the organization , based in the hague ordered in damascus to destroy or &quot; render inoperable &quot; all chemical weapons production units and machines used to mix the toxic gases and ammunition .
the completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy chemical weapons in damascus by mid-2014 .
thanks to the destruction of equipment , syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
however , damascus has yet to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves .
they think that the country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin .
the announcement was made as the fighting raged on thursday in the town of safira , which , according to the experts , is a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites , reported the syrian observatory for human rights based in britain .
the militant group , which follows the evolution of the human toll through a network of militants based in syria , said on thursday that 120 296 people had died .
among them , it is estimated that there were 61 72,067 6,365,800 civilians including children .
on the government side , it is estimated that 29 954 members of the armed forces of president bashar al-assad were killed , including 18 678 were combatants of the pro-government forces and 187 of the lebanese hezbollah militants .
among the dead , it is also believed that 2,202 were deserters and some 375 of the opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
on july 25 , the united nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since march 2011 .
it has not updated that figure since .
some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
assad &apos;s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to the al-qaeda network , safira for weeks .
the observatory said on thursday that there were casualties on both sides , but gave no explanation .
the fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the inspectors in charge of chemical weapons when they need to complete their mission , which is to rid syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that , under tight deadlines .
a statement by the opcw , which works in close collaboration with the united nations , indicated that his team was &quot; now satisfied to have controlled - and destroyed-all critical production and machinery for mixing and filling . &quot;
she added that &quot; no other inspection activities were planned for the moment . &quot;
earlier in the week , the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the audit work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by damascus .
they have not been able to visit the latter two sites because of security concerns , said the inspectors .
on thursday , the opcw said that the two sites were , according to syria , &quot; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program , which had been moved to other sites , which were inspected . &quot;
it was unclear at first whether the safira unit was one of two sites that the opcw inspectors were unable to visit .
syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons , which was approved by the executive committee of the opcw .
&quot; i welcome the moral strength and the courage you have all shown in the context of the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; said the organisation &apos;s director general , ahmet uzumcu , in a commentary published by the opcw .
now in its third year , the civil war between mainly sunni muslim rebels the government of assad and his security forces , which are supported by members of the alawite sect , an offshoot of shiite islam .
on the other hand , the director of the syrian observatory for human rights said that there had been a loud explosion on wednesday in an air defence base in the syrian coastal province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion remains unknown , he added .
two employees of the ymca , accused of sexual assault allegations made against jonathan lord , at a hearing of the royal commission .
two employees of the ymca of south wales were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of caringbah , jonathan lord , in 2011 , at a hearing of the royal commission on child sexual abuse .
but in his opening statement to the committee , the ymca stated that he &quot; never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization . &quot;
the director general phillip hare was questioned on two cases : a ymca employee has been charged with offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor at the ymca caringbah hall was found guilty of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991 .
mr. o &apos;hare told gail furness , senior counsel to the commission , that he had knowledge of the first case , but that he was not aware of the second .
he also admitted that the ymca &apos;s opening statement was incorrect in stressing , &quot; ymca external controls were conducted and indicated that children &apos;s safety was a top priority for the organization . &quot;
it was shown to the commission that the ymca had been informed that he had received the worst ratings on four institutions in an audit of the department of education and communities in august this year .
mr. o &apos;hare , who began working at the ymca at the age of 21 , admitted that the personnel management was a failure with the recruitment of lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any breach of the security policy .
earlier in the year , lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the ymca .
he was sentenced to six years in prison .
but he rejected the idea that the ymca had a cultural problem preventing the staff to report breaches of lord to the safety of children .
staff members have testified that they had observed some shortcomings , including the fact that lord remained alone with the children , that he kept them in private , sat her on his lap , told them he loved them and left them playing with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , which was overseen by lord and who had requested training on child protection because she worried about her conduct , said she found the head of children &apos;s services in the ymca caringbah , jacqui barnat , which covered lord &quot; very intimidating and difficult to reach most of the time . &quot;
the director general said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report such violations to their supervisor .
instead , he said that the friendly relations with lord have blurred their judgment , so that they do not have reported his actions .
mr. o &apos;hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the ymca of south wales saying that , for the organization , the lesson of &quot; the jonathan lord incident &quot; should not be &quot; reporting &quot; by the staff , and the board had agreed with him .
mr. hare has said that the decision to staff to sign confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations were raised , was taken by the director general of the ymca for children &apos;s services , liam whitley .
he said the decision was designed to prevent contamination of evidence , but that it was an &quot; excess of zeal &quot; and that she had been poorly implemented .
the ymca of south wales was not a reliable organization for children when jonathan lord was employed there , between 2009 and 2011 , said the expert on child sexual abuse , professor stephen smallbone of griffith university in front of the commission .
he said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , screening , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing was adjourned until december 20 .
a ceremony in memory of the deceased cr√©matis√©s
the crematorium of pere lachaise , at 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony in memory of all the deceased cr√©matis√©s in its establishment , in the course of the year .
anne hidalgo , the socialist candidate for the mayor of paris will attend , and then explains , at a press conference on its proposals .
in order to follow the ceremony , click above .
for their own funerals , more and more french people choose cremation rather than burial : 53 % , according to an ipsos study on september 6 and 7 from 1009 people , instead of 47 % .
for the funeral of a loved one , it is the opposite : the french prefer burial ( 53 % 47 % ) .
if they have the misfortune of losing a child , they are only 15 % to choose cremation .
in his book the death in ashes , damien the guay , philosopher and vice-chairman of the national committee of ethics of the funeral home , stresses the &quot; violence &quot; of the cremation , for the survivors .
there , with the cremation , &quot; an act of violence to the body like , &quot; which will be &quot; reduced to a heap of ashes &quot; in a very short time , and not after a process of decomposition , which &quot; would accompany the stages of grief . &quot;
there is also a &quot; symbolic violence &quot; , which is the &quot; erasure of the unique and distinctive signs &quot; reduced to the &quot; anonymity &quot; of ashes .
why what is accepted in some nordic countries and protestant , is it still lived in france ?
&quot; because the cremation is new , &quot; said marie-fr√©d√©rique bacqu√© , president of the society of thanatology and author of the book &quot; taming death .
it is tolerated since 1963 by the catholic church , which has limited attempts to tame it .
apprivoiser la cr√©mation , fran√ßois michaud-n√©rard , director general of the funeral services of the city of paris , provide for the deceased a ceremony also fit than he would with a burial .
the ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony .
77 % of the french want a , for their loved ones , be it religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
now , 73 % of those who chose cremation want to organize a ceremony .
66 % of atheists or believers want too .
crematoriums have adapted to the evolution of society .
&quot; for a decade , they are trying to prevent family violence to wait , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the presentation of the ashes , &quot; mr. michaud-n√©rard observed .
70 % of schools now offer masters of ceremonies , which are , in the presence of the body , the ritual : hosting the assembly , appoint the deceased , the link to the other , the raise , give meaning to her death , organizing the farewell .
this is the case at the crematorium of pere lachaise , since 1998 .
the masters of ceremonies are often people who have switched .
there are also old catholic priests .
it is in this context that the crematorium of pere lachaise , since 2010 , all saints day , ceremonies of remembrance , both secular and religious , to which he invited the families of people who were cr√©matis√©es in the year .
for the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies is rebroadcast online , to the attention of those who could not make the trip .
the crematorium has authorized us to pass it on .
hagel criticized 9 american states of violating gay rights
since the federal government has recognized same-sex marriage , &quot; all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the department of defense and the benefits that come with , &quot; recalled the minister in new york in a speech to the anti-defamation league for combating anti-semitism .
&quot; but some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex partners in national guard facilities established on their territory , he denounced , accusing them of violating the federal law and the principle of equality .
without these cards , these people cannot take advantage of the many health or social services provided in these databases , or access to their stores .
the defense secretary said to have ordered the head of the national guard , general frank grass , to ensure the implementation of the federal law .
the sling of the nine states began in texas that refuses to implement these benefits to the settlements of the texas national guard , because of a conflict between the texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage .
he was joined in his refusal in indiana , georgia , florida , mississippi , louisiana , oklahoma , south carolina and west virginia , according to a senior official of the defense .
the pentagon believes the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to about 5600 active people , 17,000 , including the national guard , reserve and retired .
the price of oil continues to fall and is close to $ 96 a barrel
oil prices continued to fall on friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the chinese manufacturing sector gourmand / e electricity is being strengthened .
the price of benchmark u.s. crude for december delivery fell 14 cents to $ 96.24 a barrel by late morning in europe in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) .
the contract lost 39 cents on thursday , leaving it with a drop of 5.8 % for the month of october .
the abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks .
the u.s. department of energy reported wednesday that us supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels .
but two reports on the chinese manufacturing sector reached on friday , which showed a growth in activity , suggest an increased demand .
this suggests that the economic recovery in china could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter .
brent crude , a benchmark for international crude oil used by american refineries , lost 26 cents to $ 108,58 per barrel on the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) in london .
back in black and white for marie chouinard , who danced with his two new group choreography : the first inspired inks and poems of henri michaux , the second by the famous piano solos satie &apos;s gnossiennes .
on a night that enables us to see all the prism of chouinard , art the tics and black ink on white .
a white screen serves as a background wall .
on the carpet , also white , in the vast space that is the th√©√¢tre maisonneuve , to advance , in profile , the end as a line and dressed in black , a body .
on the screen , the ink of henri michaux is projected .
the body , in simple terms , takes its shape .
and this will be the form of the entire piece : an intriguing physical imitation of the drawings .
the dancers , dressed entirely in black , only the hands and face uncovered , expect from each side of the playground , rush when the next graphie appears , embody , stand out .
this black and white game of henri michaux is healnet solos , unison group ( a mass that solo ) , with a large group of twelve solos where everyone carries his sign .
think of &quot; morning glory , &quot; where , solo , chouinard performs a series of tasks chor√©graphiques written on cartels , posed at the forefront .
it is the same principle , giant powerpoint version .
here , the music is strong , percussion and electric guitars .
energy is high , the rapid pace .
there will be a break when carol prieur sickly under the carpet of dance , to deliver , microphone in hand , without a sobriety and restraint , a part of the poem by michaux , monotonous and dull in the auction , and continue dancing .
and the music departed and the sequence of resume .
this discharge sound and energetic , long , if it can , eventually muffle and numb .
so has the regularity of the visual rhythm .
there are some nice flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in chouinard - such as these that is ruffling hair or black fabrics , which prolong the lines .
but the lack of choreographic composition .
one has the impression that the choreographer , instead of going to the meeting of the work of michaux , emerged with his tics .
the result : the bodies appear in front of the drawings .
inks michaux , as forms of gestalt , open a broader imagination swamps that dance , more porous .
only the late , negative , with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre , touches on the magic .
the public liked , the reception was warm .
the gnossiennes , after the intermission , is richer .
the scene is partly gray cummerbund , dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics , furniture in an abandoned house .
at the piano , the dancers take turns to play the partitions .
their music , touching awkwardness , give a real fragility .
on stage , the couples , love duets , very sensual , even erotic .
group work , small transitions solos , ensembles , choruses , the writing is less binary .
buffoons are as familiar as chouinard , wearing the red nose , in parades gender amoureusses very polarized .
love affairs are carnivores , shifty or players .
the gestures , the laughter and the small cree transposes beautifully archaic , grace and ridiculous bodies in coitus , people who are based .
but the piece takes its impetus from real salvation .
a clown returns to the fore when the public leaves .
then , everything becomes possible : the fourth wall falls , the unexplored universe are superimposed , dancers cabotinent , down among the spectators , pontificate , smoke , short-circuit , codes of applause , stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated that remains sensual disorder .
the joy and the sweaty folly , and it is the art of chouinard , contaminating the public .

report : the obama campaign considered dropping biden for hillary clinton
the closest advisors of president barack obama , in the utmost secrecy , to replace vice president joe biden for hillary clinton in 2012 , according to the new york times .
this revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by mark halperin and john heilemann , &quot; double down : game change 2012 . &quot;
the times obtained a copy of the book to be published and said on thursday evening that the president &apos;s close aides had conducted &quot; extensive work in groups and polls end 2011 &quot; to see if the eviction of biden could help obama in his re-election as its hopes have dwindled .
according to the times political correspondent jonathan martin , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior officials of the campaign and the white house , the former secretary general of the white house , bill daley , to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-president by the former secretary of state clinton on the ballot .
the possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded in the campaign headquarters in chicago , and inside the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisors - including daley , the former obama campaign manager jim messina and former white house advisers david axelrod and david plouffe-knew that the change was under review .
&quot; double down &quot; indicates that daley has led the charge to replace biden , despite their &quot; close personal relationship , &quot; before eventually deciding against the change when figures showed that having clinton on the presidential list &quot; does not improve significantly the chances of success of obama . &quot;
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing biden by clinton .
&quot; i said that i had discussed a series of issues , and this was one of them , &quot; daley said at the newspaper .
remember that at that time , the president was not in shape , and so we said , &apos; lord , what can we do ?
while daley described the review as &quot; cooperative , &quot; martin told anderson cooper of cnn that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in order to find out whether the change would benefit at the polls .
&quot; the campaigns do not spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking measures , &quot; said martin on ac 360 .
however , it is not clear whether obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement .
martin said on cnn that he had asked daley if his boss was aware of a possible reshuffle .
while daley has said he does not believe that the president &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former secretary general has admitted that it was &quot; possible &quot; obama knew .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; final did not respond to the question of whether the political polls had arrived at the obama office .
cooper asked martin if he seriously thought that obama did not know that the eviction of biden &apos;s presidential list was discussed .
&quot; maybe , &quot; replied martin .

the announcement of the release of a new album by david bowie had left everyone stunned .
on the day of his 66th birthday on january 8 , 2013 , he said that a new album released in march .
after ten years of silence ( the last album , reality , date of 2003 ) and too few public appearances , the english musician proved that one could still count on him to sweep the pop scene .
a feast for fans
not tired of surprises , david bowie was more a trick in his bag with the next day .
the thin white duke was expected to repeat this album , on 4 november .
for the occasion he has concocted a real feast for his fans .

previously unreleased listening
but atomica is not the only way to reveal its charms .
the information , like a rocket man , born in a ufo is also available on the web .
the double-sided : is a worrying ma√Ætris√©s before a cavalcade of light that gradually slows to a pop ballad .
on like a rocket man , bowie he wanted to make a small reference to rocket man elton john or even gravity ?
with the playful title , the singer seems to be in his element when he has his feet on the ground .
space oddity , meanwhile , was much more serious .
about born in a ufo , david bowie is once again referred to his strangeness : it would come from another planet ?
the guitar riffs , haunting , want to leave the land .
bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these securities : in turn informer , man on a rocket , martian potential ...
it conceals and reveals , plays to adopt different personalities , as he has done throughout his career , particularly with his characters ziggy stardust , aladdin sane .
no wonder he had a mask in the hand in the photograph of the campaign travel , the brand louis vuitton , which embodies the new face .
he will appear in one of their commercials , aired from november 10 .

a bird , hoisted after he was found exhausted on an oil platform in the north sea , was released in the wild .
it has increased the water rail aboard a helicopter in the direction of aberdeen last month before he is back on his feet by the scottish spca &apos;s rescue centre in alloa .

it seems that the exhausted birds have managed to find refuge on the oil platform .
he added : &quot; he was unable to fly again , so we have been contacted for help . &quot;
the water rail was in good health when he was released .

the subsidiary of cogeco said on thursday that it was currently engaged in preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users .
&quot; this will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options , &quot; said president and chief executive of cogeco , louis audet , in an interview .
cogeco cable is following its competitors , like bell , even though the subsidiary cogeco does not yet have a precise date for this new platform .
&quot; we have to adapt and change or resist change and fail , &quot; mr. audet said .
the ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers do not have access currently .
the telecommunications giant rogers already has indicated that it could give netflix some technical details , which were not named , could be resolved .
in the united states , the popular video service , said to be in discussions with some major cable so that its service is available via their distribution platforms .
the ceo of cogeco and cogeco cable also welcomed the announcement made by the harper government during his speech from the throne , on october 16 .
ottawa wants to force providers of cable and satellite tv to offer customers the option of paying a la carte services .
&quot; it &apos;s about two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large bundles of channels , it doesn &apos;t work , &quot; mr. audet said .
however , he hopes that the consultations conducted by the council of the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) will lead to valuable recommendations .
&quot; he will have to emerge from these discussions , a new reference framework for defining our new canadian cultural policy with regard to television , &quot; said the ceo of cogeco .
the crtc consults the public since last week and they should continue with the industry in the next spring .
the results , cogeco said to have recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 cents per share .
this is a decrease compared to net income of $ 44.9 million , or 83 cents per share , in the same period last year .
the company established in montreal due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions .
cogeco acquired in 2012 the cable atlantic broadband , established in the united states , to 1.36 billion .
it was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in portugal .
last december , the montreal-based company also bought peer 1 network enterprises , an internet service provider based in vancouver , for $ 526 million .
cogeco revenues , they have grown by 41.5 % in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million .
they are $ 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year .
the net profit of its main subsidiary , cogeco cable , was $ 43.9 million , or 90 cents per share , down from 45.7 million , or 93 cents per share , in the same period last year .
cogeco cable &apos;s revenues , however , increased by 45 % to 470.4 million .
the company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter .
however , for the fiscal year 2013 , the number of clients of cogeco cable is up ns5546 ..
mr. audet is not concerned to see the number of clients fluctuate so .
for me , it is not an indication of a change of trend , he observed .
it varies from one quarter to another with a fierce competition .
alexei miller , gazprom said that the gas pipeline from bulgaria heralds a new era of gas
the beginning of the construction of the south stream pipeline to bulgaria marks the launch of one of the biggest energy projects in europe , said the director of gazprom .
&quot; a historic event occurred today : construction began in the bulgarian part of the south stream pipeline , the large-scale project , the largest in europe , &quot; said alexei miller , gazprom &apos;s chief executive , in a statement on thursday .
this project is a key element of the energy security of the european continent as a whole .
south stream is expected to diversify export routes from russia to europe .
a contract dispute between gazprom and its ukrainian counterpart , which handles the bulk of russian gas to europe , increases the risk level compared to the conventional routes , &quot; says the director .
miller added that the direct junction to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed &quot; forever . &quot;
the bulgarian consumers will receive gas from south stream at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project will be put into service in 2015 .
gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year .
the pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas .
unknown assailants fired on a hotel near the pyramids in cairo
unknown hooded men opened fire on friday at a hotel near the cairo pyramids in egypt without any casualties , a result of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees .

schools are encouraged to focus more on math , spelling and grammar
in english literature courses , students will have to study at least one shakespeare play , a novel of the 19th century , a romantic poem and a contemporary british fiction since 1914 .
the review will also present &quot; new legislation &quot; to encourage a more diverse .
a combination of literature and english language courses will be deleted .
from 2015 , pupils will have to pass a gcse language independent , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in english literature .
the ministry of education must publish tomorrow its new english and math - the first to undergo a radical overhaul .
there will be changes in other core subjects next year .
moreover , ofqual , the regulator of examinations , will unveil an overhaul of the structure of the gcse , with a new scoring system and fewer courses .
speaking during the summer , michael gove , education minister , said that there was a &quot; broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insisting that the gcse would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
studies show that english schools spend less time on math ( 116 hours a year , or three hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
in comparison , australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year , and students in singapore are about 138 .
although there is no formal obligation to spend more time on math , sources close to the coalition government indicated that gcse maths eisr - as well as the greater importance attached to the contents contained in the international rankings-likely to encourage schools to provide more hours of courses .
the program will focus more on &quot; the real world , &quot; including financial mathematics .
the european elite is ready to do business with britain ?
the business for britain campaign was launched in april with the promise of companies together and define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the eu .
to do so , we commissioned the survey the broadest and most complete with british business leaders and asked them what they thought of the great britain , companies and the eu .
yougov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs , broadly representative of all sizes of companies , sectors , and regions of britain .
the findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of companies now seeking to export outside europe , focusing on the countries to modernize and grow while the member states of the eu .
they want the government to give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as china , india and brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and arduous process of arcane european institutional reform .
when asked their opinion on specific policies , ranging from the regulation of monopolies , the laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to the hands of westminster .
the single market has caused a general dissatisfaction , saying that the cost of regulation brussels is disproportionate to the advantages of being part of the european trading area - 40 % of big business , traditionally the most pro-european , are even agree .
finally , and more telling , our survey of business leaders found that a substantial majority wanted to see britain pursue initiatives in favour of a change of the treaty and the development of a relationship with the eu based on trade and not politics .
this conclusion , which is found in all the major groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world is insisting on a &quot; significant change &quot; that restores power to the united kingdom .
the stakes are high - to change the treaty and better represent the interests of britain would see a shift of 16 % of the votes in favor of keeping the country in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should not doubt for a moment : this survey shows that british companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of britain &apos;s membership of the eu .
it also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the uk .
it is possible , and necessary , to better represent the interests of british business , since the eurozone is committed towards a closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain and , as the findings of our investigation show , for businesses this means new focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach from brussels .
beijing is a turkmen islamic movement
&quot; the behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the east turkestan islamic movement , based in central and west asia , &quot; said the boss of chinese security organs to a hong kong television station , according to a video posted online on thursday evening on a website .
meng jianzhu , who is a member of the political bureau of the chinese communist party ( ccp ) , was speaking in tashkent on an official visit to uzbekistan .
it is the first time that a chinese official refers to a particular organization after monday &apos;s attack .
according to the chinese police , three uighur men from the same family of the predominantly muslim region of xinjiang , which borders several central asian countries , have hastened their car with gas cans against the entry of the forbidden city in beijing , in a suicide attack that killed two people and wounded 40 .
the driver of the car , his wife and her mother died in the fire at the car .
the etim , which says it is fighting for the independence of east turkestan , the former name of the chinese xinjiang , was ranked by the un in 2002 among the organisations affiliated to al-qaeda .
this movement is often referred to by the chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic unrest in xinjiang , but his real influence is questioned by several experts .

ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
the rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s on friday lowered the credit rating of ukraine , putting in doubt the capacity of the former soviet union , in recession for over a year , to meet its financial obligations .
the public debt of the country is at &quot; b - , &quot; spinning into the speculative investment category .
it is accompanied by a negative outlook , s &amp; p sees at least one chance in three that it be lowered again within a year .
&quot; it is becoming less likely that the government &apos;s strategy to ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its large external financing needs , &quot; explains the american agency .
the agency notes that ukraine &apos;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 % between september 2012 and september 2013 and expects that the trend will continue .
this complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad .
these reservations , which the authorities have used heavily to support the local currency , the hryvnia , collapsing , the agency considers increasingly likely a devaluation , inflating its external debt .
kiev needs cash to pay for its gas imports from russia , which accuses it of failing to pay a bill of $ 882 million .
this announcement is bad news for the ukrainian power at a time of heightened tensions with its russian neighbour , angered by the will of kiev to sign an association agreement with the eu by the end of november .
it was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy suffered between july and september , its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction .
his debt , still relatively modest , has exploded in recent years and s &amp; p estimated at 33.5 % of gdp , against less than 10 % before the crisis of 2008-2009 .
the country , with a budget deficit , has been demanding for months the help of the international monetary fund , which had awarded him in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and has set aside for the moment that 3.4 billion .
but the fund refuses to make any further as long as the country fails to adopt an unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , including raising the price of gas .
after another unsuccessful mission in the country , the imf noted this week that &quot; the significant external financing needs &quot; constituted &quot; a vulnerability , &quot; while noting &quot; some signs of economic improvement . &quot;
however , for the economist oleksandr joloud , of the centre for political studies , &quot; we cannot wait for an improvement in the short term . &quot;
&quot; there is little hope that unpopular reforms are undertaken in a pre-election year , &quot; the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015 , the expert , interviewed by afp .
the only hope is an improvement of the international environment .
s &amp; p also noted the &quot; uncertainty &quot; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between ukraine and the eu , as brussels prepares for the release of the opponent , yulia tymoshenko .
&quot; signing the agreement would be good for trade in the long term , but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium terms linked to russia &apos;s reaction , &quot; said s &amp; p , which fears of &quot; trade restrictions &quot; from moscow .
the federation , which represents a quarter of ukrainian exports , warned that in the case of creation of a free trade area between the eu and kiev , it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods .
singapore pawnbrokers are benefiting the middle class forced to tighten their belts
in a pawnbroker bendemeer shopping centre in singapore , janani amirthalinga d√©pose a bracelet , a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay school fees for his daughters .
&quot; my husband and i just bought a house so all my money is gone , &quot; says ms amirthalinga ..
while she earns $ 3,000 from singapore ( $ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband also works , the monthly family income is not sufficient , &quot; she said .
in fact , the demand is such in parts of southeast asia-where household debt increases - as valuemax , where she completed her transaction , this week became the third loan guarantee to be introduced to the singapore stock exchange .
pawning jewelry is not just a quick way to get cash - $ 1,300 for singapore in the case of ms amirthalinga-but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
in general , the pawn of singapore collect an annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % offered by united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .
however , have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary , and can make the loans more quickly than the banks .
as a result , millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops as families feel the pressure of the rising cost of living and the indebtedness of households and consumers .
after five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis , and the cheap credit fueled by a lax monetary policy in advanced economies , and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers for bridging the difference while their economies were experiencing a slowdown .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s cited the mounting debt of households , resulting mainly from increases in mortgage lending , as a risk factor for asian banks &apos; solvency .
she said that malaysia , thailand and singapore recorded the ratio of household debt to gross domestic product , the highest in asia .
malaysia tops the list with 80 % of gdp , while the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
economists also worry that the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which came out just this week of a technical recession .
on thursday , data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
&quot; the bottom line is that with rising costs , the people in the middle or at the bottom of the wage scale &#93; looking to supplement their income as they can , &quot; said song seng wun , an economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
the historically high price of gold over the past two years , the people are quick to pledge their personal effects in order to receive the cash value of their jewellery .
in singapore , about 70 % of articles pledged in the 200 shops of pawning the city-state are gold .
people say , &quot; the price of gold is high , pawned the gold chain of grandmother and they will look for the next month . &quot;
in thailand , the largest operator of pawn shops , easymoney , recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months .
the increase in the loan guarantee that valuemax , operator of the shop in bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in singapore , plans to develop not only in neighbouring malaysia , where it already has four shops-but also outside of asia , said yeah lee ching , its general director .
the company will fund them using 60 % of the $ 66 million from singapore that she raised this week in his introduction to the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders to cut rates came under criticism for the exorbitant interest rates , ms. yeah indicates that the pledge does not only offer lower rates than other lenders , but it does not increase the debt directly .
&quot; the customers &apos; mortgage assets they already have , and monetize their personal property does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .
the pledge is becoming more accepted socially as a means of obtaining secured financing in the short term .
the people who go to the pawnbrokers are also not only those who have financial problems .
the wealthy people in singapore are also in the shops of pawning valuemax for pawning gold bars or rolex watches , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash .
we are seeing clients from all segments of society .
&quot; it can be for wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments , or small companies that have cash to spend a difficult hurdle , &quot; adds ms. yeah ..
sometimes , they just need money very quickly .
the lawyer who advised addicted to a drug &apos;s sponsor of a police investigation was jailed
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to the crime lord neil scarbrough
the lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed in broad daylight
he was sentenced to a prison term of three years by the court of assize of liverpool
a defense lawyer , who had advised a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave sensitive information to the crime lord neil scarbrough of investigations into his activities connected with drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine .
the lawyer , who was nicknamed &quot; bash &quot; and considered by criminals as &quot; a matter of primary importance , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following the police bugging operations directed at scarborough , which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
police officers spotted sarborough , 32 , of three bags of cocaine in the home of the lawyer in blackburn , in lancashire , while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues .
the investigation revealed that ditta was a &quot; regular customer &quot; of this class a drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the scarborough as well as one of his associates .
the four suspects were being monitored at the time by the police in connection with a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of cumbria , lancashire , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
with 32 other men , they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for a ¬£ 1.5 m , as well as more than 200,000 pounds in cash during a series of raids .
ditta , 42 , provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is revealed .
today , the court of assizes of liverpool , ditta , who works at the law firm of forbes solicitors in blackburn , fell into disfavor after he was found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial .
he had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing .
the fall of the lawyer came after police , investigating scarborough , discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with ditta in february 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of ditta and placing of the pure drug , 60 % , in the dustbin of the lawyer in a black golf glove .
shortly after the tabling , scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with ditta which was at a dinner at the football stadium of the ewood park club , blackburn rovers .
the lawyer returned home , found the drugs and they are telephoned nine times .
the court heard that ditta was a &quot; regular &quot; consumers of cocaine after tests showed traces of the drug in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .
ditta was arrested later , but denied using cocaine . he said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot; legal privilege . &quot;
during his arrest , ditta picked his portfolio and attempted to remove several credit cards , but they were all seized and collected a sample of hair .
in an interview , he said he had an office in his home to his workplace and that customers call him home for legal issues .
but the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade , some of whom he had represented after arrests key to tell them what investigators were aware .
the public prosecutor anne whyte said : &quot; if someone needs to know that it does not violate the law , it is a criminal lawyer . &quot;
mr ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer , and too involved with individual clients .
the relationship that we are talking about is not just a drug dealer , but a drug dealer supplying drugs to her own lawyer .
some of its communications will undoubtedly be of legitimate communications because it was her lawyer .
but it went far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client .
he interfered with the investigation of the police as much as it could to enable him to continue his criminal activities .
mr ditta did not honour to her profession , but the mud .
he is too close to some customers , in particular , scarborough , and he left .
ditta has denied any wrongdoing and said : &quot; if i was a corrupt lawyer , what i am not , and if i had wanted to provide information to mr. scarborough , i would not have waited 15 hours , i would have done it immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing , the superintendent lee halstead of the lancashire police said : &quot; mr ditta from criminal lawyer to itself when it began to buy drugs from criminal organizations . &quot;
his addiction to cocaine was never compromised and left it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of leaders of organized criminal groups to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
the lawyers should observe the rules of the most stringent integrity and establish a climate of confidence among the public .
mr ditta has betrayed that trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession .
the unit responsible for the serious and organised crime in the lancashire conducted the survey on mr ditta , who was found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstructing justice , reflecting its commitment to bring criminals to justice .
this case should serve as a warning to criminals that they know that no one is above the law .
we will find you and bring you to the courts .
scarborough was himself jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
thirty-five other people involved in the smuggling were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking .
on its website , ditta organized a meeting of questions and answers about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in america , its last dinner guest would be mohammed ali and inequality would be what would motivate it to work .

a difficult year for pharmacists
the departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the center of health and social services ( csss ) laval caused quite a stir in the management of the hospital of the cit√©-de-la-sant√© and that , during the year 2012-2013 .
because of retirements , maternity leave or departures , the pharmacy department found deficit sharply .
missing nearly 30 % of the staffing requirements , making this fiscal year &quot; very difficult , &quot; according to the head of the department , gillian beaudet .
however , the csss decided not to hire independent labour , which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist .
they didn &apos;t use the troubleshooting , explained dr. beaudet .
rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the institution to remedy , the time that things would sort themselves out .
of course , it was hard to get our young &#91; residents &#93; to come and stay here .
there is a set of circumstances that we were in a bad situation last year .
situation improved
after this period , the year 2013 will be much easier for the department of pharmacy of cssh ..
already , three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists were hired in recent months .
in addition , the department &apos;s efforts to retain have borne fruit , because the four students currently in residence in laval also decided to remain in the employment of the csss .
things are much better now , stressed the pharmacist .
by the end of the fiscal year , we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns .
this will fill our departures last year .
ever-increasing needs
however , the situation remains delicate .
several factors , such as the shortage of pharmacists in the hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession , make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 are hard to predict .
for us &#91; strength &#93; is still precarious , because there is an environment that is young and employs many young women with pregnancies , almost always stretches to three maternity leave when things are going well , she added .
last year , there were many more , and pharmacists are not available to make replacements , so it was more difficult .

anger at the sentence against one of the bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice , saying that umar patek should be executed by firing squad .
patek , who spent nearly 10 years at large as one of the most wanted men in southeast asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks .
he could be released after 15 years on parole .
the 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , which killed 202 people , including 88 australians , and left many injured .
he was also convicted of numerous other counts in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches in indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors had requested a life sentence , but they could have asked that the man , described as &quot; demolition man &quot; for his reputation as an expert in making bombs , to be sentenced to death .
the decision has rekindled painful memories for june corteen , a mother from perth who lost both his 39-year-old sister , jane and jenny , the destruction perpetrated by patek and other conspirators there nearly a decade ago .
on the verge of tears , she said that patek have been sentenced to death .
i really think that he ought to follow the same path as other men .
&quot; he should be dragged in front of the firing squad , &quot; said ms. corteen the paa .
i have to live every day without having other grandchildren , to see my daughters .
the sari club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , in a van parked outside , exploded just after 11 p.m. on october 12 , 2002 .
peter hughes was at paddy &apos;s bar when a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier .
he fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month , and it is &quot; death &quot; three times while he was on life support .
mr. hugues said patek ought to suffer the same fate as the other three members of the jemaah islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage-amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra - who were executed there .
in fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
kept alive , why , there is no reason to keep him alive .
spend 20 years in prison after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds of others , it is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be brought to justice .
he had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years , but was finally arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where american forces will kill the former al-qaeda leader , osama bin laden , less than four months later .
during the trial , an fbi agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that patek was in pakistan to meet bin laden in order to re-establish links between terrorist groups in southeast asia and al-qaida .
&quot; he has not delivered , &quot; added ms corteen ..
until recently , he cared less about the grief he had caused to others .
the verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks , which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in bali and australia .
&quot; there will be a lot of tears this year , &quot; said ms corteen ..
patek , however , can appeal against his conviction .
tony blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister , but acknowledged that her return is unlikely .
in an interview last night to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his mandate , the 59-year-old man made his opinion known on various national policies .
since his departure in june 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country , mr blair has largely avoided discussing british politics , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as special envoy of the quartet for the middle east peace process .
when asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister , mr blair replied , according to the london evening standard : &quot; yes , of course , but it is likely to happen , so ... &quot;

the death of hakimullah mehsud has been announced several times in the past .
but intelligence officials , the military and the militant movement said this time he had killed in the air strike in the north waziristan region .
&quot; we can confirm that hakimullah mehsud was killed in a drone firing , &quot; said a senior security official .

imbroglio around the emergency closure of l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu
faced with the sling over several months by a part of the personal and several unions , including the cgt , the health minister , marisol touraine , had decided on 10 july of &quot; d√©caler the timetable for implementation of the project , and in particular the closing date of the emergencies that can only intervene on 4 november . &quot;
a formal request &quot; in order not to take any risks on emergency care in paris at the beginning of the winter &quot; , but that it does not interfere with the sp campaign a few months .
despite the instructions , the closure should be effective on that date .
although aphp , prefers to use the term &quot; processing &quot; or &quot; change in continuity . &quot;
as of november 4 , the firefighters who were about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu will be instructed to take the 30 or so serious cases a day to emergencies in other hospitals .
that date of november 4 is also the renewal of boarding schools .
a l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu , specializing in emergencies will on monday to five general internal medicine .
as for the transfer of internal medicine , is scheduled for later this month .
&quot; the emergency service of l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu must close soon , and for us , it is on 4 november , &quot; insures lo√Øc capron , president of the medical commission of establishment aphp ( cme ) , which supports the project .
&quot; on november 4 , there will be more patients brought in by the fire brigade , only people coming through their own means , &quot; confirms dr. jean-yves fagon , the medical director of the new l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu .
&quot; but we will continue to accept emergency patients , &quot; he qualifies , arguing the permanent presence of language-stimulating vehicles on site for serious cases .
senior emergency doctors will remain in place , he also provides .
but it is to the ars to decide on the closure of the emergency service .
&quot; things are gradually , &quot; said nicolas p√©ju , spokesman of the lra , who , on 4 november , &quot; there will be no change in terms of service . &quot;
&quot; the minister lied to us or lied to him , &quot; the doctor gerald kierzek .
dismissed from his position as head of the mug at the beginning of july for having led the slingshot against the proposed reorganization , it is defined as a &quot; warning &quot; to launch a &quot; cynical decision &quot; taken by &quot; technostructure medico-administrative . &quot;
&quot; they are emptying and stifle emergencies that were renovated within the past five years , &quot; he said .
for him , &quot; while other emergency services parisians could absorb surplus , it would not be a problem . &quot;
but they are regularly clogged .
there is , for example , sometimes nine hours of waiting in the emergency room of lariboisi√®re ..
the ars , argues that thirty patients &quot; dispatched &quot; at several sites does not represent an &quot; avalanche &quot; in other emergency services , including the human resources have also been strengthened .
the ars as aphp , defended the &quot; new hospital model &quot; already initiated since october 7 , and that should continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year .
by the end of the year , general practitioners liberals should also participate in the establishment of a &quot; permanent outpatient care . &quot;
&quot; where do we va-t if we ask people to self-diagnose , &quot; asked gerald kierzek , for whom &quot; the concept of urgency not serious &quot; is &quot; dangerous &quot; and a &quot; medical regression . &quot;
this will happen as in maternity wards .
people are not crazy , they go where the best care .
if the minister does not here on monday , we will change gear , warns christophe prudhomme , physician and member of the cgt .
we are going to be even more present in the framework of the municipal campaign and we will present a list .
in the team of nathalie kosciusko-morizet , vincent roger , ump adviser in paris and elected the 4th arrondissement , announces that &quot; even though the ump in paris was to maintain emergency l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them up to the responsibility . &quot;
anne hidalgo , candidate ps , reiterated on france inter on monday morning that it had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 november .
if that were the case , it would mark its disagreement net , said bruno julliard , his spokesman .
even though the restructuring of l &apos;h√¥tel-dieu has its legitimacy on the merits , we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of report to other hospitals .
you think that travel agencies were in the past because of the internet ?
flight centre seems to reverse the trend .
the company has revised its forecast for net profit to rise and hopes to record results thanks to holidaymakers from australia and the united kingdom .
the travel agency now expects an underlying profit for the full year between 325 and $ 340 million before taxes , compared with a previous forecast of $ 305 to $ 315 million .

&quot; since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we operate are profitable , and several of them are on track to achieve record results on the whole of the year before interest and taxes , &quot; he said .
this is australia and the united kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits .
in australia , the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half , which helped offset a domestic market of business travel declined slightly .
similarly , in the uk , the leisure travel sector of flight centre has recorded good results while business customers spent less .
its subsidiary in the united states has recovered its losses in the first half , where the seasonal demand is weak and needed to make a profit on the whole of the year for the third consecutive time .

gm recalls some of its new pickups in the united states to repair seat
general motors co recalled nearly 19,000 of its new chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra pickups 2014 in order to solve a problem with reclining files manually , according to a statement friday from the u.s. agency responsible for regulating the safety of vehicles .
on some pickups , the front seats could be a defect in the reclining mechanism .
as a result , the files do not meet federal standards on vehicle safety restraints .
&quot; if the vehicle is struck from behind , it is possible that the head restraint does not protect passengers properly , thereby increasing the risk of injury , &quot; according to the statement posted on the website of the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) .
the recalled models were built between august 1 and september 10 .
the deployment of the gm pickups began in june and is the launch of the most important vehicles for the first american automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009 .
gm has told the owners of pickups of failure during the first half of october .
the nhtsa did not review the information letter to owners because of the 16-day shutdown of government activities , which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in october .
sales of the silverado and sierra pickups , which were redesigned for the 2014 model , have increased by about 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , gm said friday .
in october , gm has sold 42 660 silverado pickups and 16 503 sierra pickups .
the price of shares in gm rose 1.4 % to $ 37.47 on the new york stock exchange on friday afternoon .

pope francis will appoint its first cardinal in february
pope francis will appoint new cardinals of the roman catholic church for the first time on 22 february , the vatican announced on thursday .
the cardinals are the men of the church at the highest levels in the catholic church , the pope and the people who elect , fran√ßois will appoint its first group of men who ultimately will choose his successor .
there are now 201 cardinals .
however , as soon as a cardinal at the age of 80 , he can no longer participate in the election of a pope -- it belongs to a group of 120 &quot; cardinal electors . &quot;
in a statement announcing the new , father federico lombardi , a vatican spokesman , said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which the bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal , known as a consistory .
&quot; pope francis has decided to communicate its decision to convene the consistory in february in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the cardinals from different parts of the world , &quot; lombardi said .
jack valero of the catholic voices said that by february , the number of cardinal electors will probably be declined .
he said that a pope named cardinals in general as much as necessary to ensure that the number of cardinal electors reaches 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age he wanted .
the consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of pope francis in march of this year , said valero .
at the moment , there is a tendency to focus on europe and italy in particular .
&quot; it will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals of the rest of the world in order to restore the balance , &quot; he added .
40 % of roman catholics live in south america , but a small number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be selected since francis formed the council of cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world to discuss ways to reform the church .
earlier , the pope decide alone .
&quot; now , fran√ßois chose these eight cardinals to help , &quot; said valero .
he added that it was &quot; entirely possible &quot; that francis to the cardinals .
but we have never experienced such a situation-it is totally new .
valero said that popes in general of bishops represent large communities to the rank of cardinal , but francis was &quot; full of surprises - so we do not know who he will appoint . &quot;
tenants must go to vote , because each of them are paying an average of $ 100 a month on housing prices that goes in taxes to the city .
when the owner pays $ 5,000 in municipal taxes , it divides it between each dwelling .
we are forced to increase rents to help pay the new taxes .
voting , we are sending a clear message .
we need to change things in the city .
all the candidates have told us that they would be involved in the scandalous debt .
we no longer have the means to pay for fireworks for $ 100,000 , to $ 5 million for the case .
going to vote is the best way to express yourself and say that enough is enough .

gerard de villiers , the author of &quot; sas , &quot; has died .
he has never seen the word retirement .
the phenomenon of the french edition , gerard de villiers , died on thursday at 83 years old , had just published its 200th sas , &quot; the revenge of the kremlin . &quot;
in february , the new york times as &quot; the author of spy novels who knew too much . &quot;
he was then to spend ten days in afghanistan , theatre of 198 and 199 a / es opus from the famous series of spy novels .
physically diminished by a very serious cardiac event in december 2010 , he was traveling on this trip with a walker .
and before the afghanistan , he was also leaving libya , russia , lebanon and mali .
with four sas produced each year , gerard de villiers , born december 8 1929 in paris , was unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the release of &quot; sas in istanbul , &quot; the first of the series , nearly half a century .
&quot; probably between 120 and 150 million for all countries , &quot; arguing it last march .
her burmese cat on the knees , in the living room of his apartment in a building on the avenue foch , near the arc de triomphe , the malicious eye under his white hair , he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of sas were translated : italian , german , russian , greek , japanese , or korean .
&quot; not counting the pirated editions , &quot; he added , pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronze or ivory reported from 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels .
for the price of a packet of cigarettes , the reader is treated to the traditional coverage with a photo of a young woman in the chest , with a pistol or an assault rifle .
inside , his serene highness ( sas ) prince malko linge , austrian aristocrat gone broke and contracted by the cia to pay for the repairs of the family castle , launches into packages of all villains , communists in the 1970s and 1980s , then jihadists from the 1990s .
each book , the same recipe : a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism , some scenes of sex addict , a dash of violence and torture .
&quot; i never had any claim to be a literary writer , &quot; explained gerard de villiers .
i consider myself a storyteller who writes for the people that i did not send a message .
he worked &quot; as the great reporters before war , albert londres type , who went out and returned with real and lengthy investigations . &quot;
sas &apos;s father said , &quot; a kind of geopolitical paper . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m in my files ( afghanistan , syria , ... ) before you go , &quot; added gerard de villiers .
on the spot , i meet journalists , including afp , diplomats , people i know for some twenty or thirty years .
the coup , many of its sas are often prescient : so , a month before the attack from a command center of the syrian regime that killed several senior officials , he had told the story in &quot; the road to damascus . &quot;
in &quot; the madmen of benghazi , &quot; he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the cia in that city , the cradle of the libyan revolt .
in 1980 , he was directing the assassination of egyptian president anwar sadat in cairo &quot; the plot &quot; , a year before the attack .
in october 2012 , in &quot; panic in bamako , &quot; he chronicled the 4x4 columns of jihadists that based on the malian capital .
i am not clairvoyant , defended gerard de villiers , i am simply assumptions from the country that i know well and , from time to time , some of my assumptions come true .
after these trips in troubled areas , he would sit for a month behind its ibm typewriter to marguerite dating back to 1976 , &quot; where all of the pieces were changed . &quot;
300 pages later , he wrote the word &quot; end &quot; and corrected each page in pen .
on the walls of his office are hung with ak-47 assault rifles , erotic photos and photos of the author with warlords in africa .
regularly singled out for machismo by feminist and leagues for racism by human rights organisations , gerard de villiers departed these charges in two sentences .
some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful , intelligent and courageous women .
i am always welcomed in africa , where i have so many readers .
gerard de villiers said : &quot; malko linge , like all heroes , not age . &quot;
he will not die and will not retreat .
not more than me .

porch lights : a member calls for the resignation of brigitte grouwels
the project of the minister brigitte grouwels &quot; relifting &quot; traffic light poles in brussels does not please everyone .
in brussels , the minister of public works and transport launched thursday in the centre of brussels a test project to repaint 16 poles of lights in the region with the colours yellow and blue from brussels .
the aim is &quot; to enhance safety &quot; and &quot; brussels identity . &quot;
the idea is to paint all the signal lights in brussels , for an estimated cost of about one million euros .
but the blue chosen by the minister is &quot; too dark &quot; , according to the brussels parliament emmanuel de bock who speaks of &quot; flamandisation &quot; in the capital and calls the &quot; resignation &quot; of brigitte grouwels .
&quot; not content to spend wildly brussels &apos; money in relifting posts signs in the colours of the brussels region , brigitte grouwels flamandisation is continuing its operations to the capital , &quot; mr. bock &apos;s scuffle in a news release .
after his taxi jaune-mangue-noir , she finally painted itself jaune-bleu bluishblack poles from brussels .
according to the mp , there is now &quot; more difference in visual continuity between flanders and brussels . &quot;
the brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a minister cd &amp; v , which produces the program itself .
it is high time to stop the trojan horse of flanders .
&quot; for the record , brigitte grouwels was elected with 2,245 votes or 0.5 % of brussels ! &quot; says de bock .
