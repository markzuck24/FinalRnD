business nsa underlines the complete lack of debate on the information
how to explain the contradictory attitude of the french government , which of with dimensions offends itself as a public by convening the ambassador of the united states on october 21st , and does other prohibit the overflight of the territory by the bolivian presidential plane , on the basis of rumour of the presence on its board edward snowden ?
in my opinion , there are two levels of answer on behalf of the french government .
when françois hollande telephones barack obama or when the foreign minister laurent fabius convenes the ambassador of the united states , they react to a true discovery , which is that of the extent of the american monitoring on the whole of the communications in france .
isn &apos;t it surprising lira in the columns of the world at a few weeks of interval on the one hand the reproduction of the american diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a judgment of listenings of the french foreign office by the nsa ?
wouldn &apos;t there be like a vague hypocrisy of your share ?
the journalistic approach is not a moral positioning , but the research of the interest and relevance of information which makes it possible to each citizen to forge an opinion .
when wikileaks raises the veil on the analysis by the american diplomacy of policy issues or others in the whole world , we consider indeed that , in comparison with the american power , that constitutes an important lighting .
when we describe the american systems of interception against the french diplomacy in the united states , it is not to in no case to make indignant us at this practice , it is to describe the world such as it is .
did france profit from furnished information by the nsa concerning of the terrorist operations aiming our interests ?
can one deprive himself of american collaboration ?
the installation for approximately ten years of technological tools for interception very powerful by the united states , but also by france , has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism .
moreover , in this field , france and the united states in particular set up quasi daily cooperation procedures and information exchanges and which are described on both sides like essential .
by way of an example , the presence of mohammed merah in the tribal zones with miranshah was announced to the french thanks to the means of the nsa .
france can be led , for example , to transmit whole blocks of data on the area of the sahel to the american services , and , on the other hand - it was already quickly said - , the americans can give information to the french about other areas of the world .
thus the basic problem behind this business nsa is not so much the capacity or the right of the countries to obtain tools with interception , only the question of the preliminary complete lack of debate , in particular within the parliaments , about the justification of such systems , the perimeter which must be theirs , and , in the final analysis , the question of the attacks to freedoms .
what risks really the united states ? a degradation of their image ?
one denounces them in vain , i do not see how they could be punished .
the risk run by the americans can be double .
the first , it is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes in the more high summit of their state , were supervised .
it is the case of brazil and germany , two countries where the diplomatic relations with the united states were tightened .
another effect can be him more economic : more and more of european companies or south american balk , in the light of the revelations , to entrust their confidential data to american people receiving benefits subjected to the american laws , and thus to the influence of the nsa .
last element : the vast movement of revelations engaged by media of the whole world , which contributes to hitherto engage a debate on the practices of monitoring of the intelligence services almost non-existent , could push the legislators , including american , to reconsider the powers which they gave at their intelligence services .
barack obama receives iraqi the prime minister , in full outburst of violence

the new vaccine anti-nicotine could remove the pleasure of smoking
scientists developed a vaccine anti-nicotine which could remove the pleasure that one takes to smoke a cigarette .
only one proportions vaccine could protect with life from the mice from the dependence to nicotine .
other tests are necessary before beginning the tests on the human being , but the professeur ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college of new york declared that the first signs were encouraging .
“ we really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will be able to help of the million smokers who tried to stop , exhausting all the methods now available on the market , but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to overcome these various approaches ” , professeur cornell declared .
the new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus which was modified to transport genetic information necessary to design antibodies anti-nicotine .
the virus repugnant in a selective way cells of the liver , which then starts to produce a regular flow of antibody .
the antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which prevented the smoker from having his nicotine amount .
at the time as of tests , the vaccinated mice to which one gave then nicotine continued their activity normally .
but the mice which had not been vaccinated “ were alleviated ” , the researchers declared , signs that nicotine had reached their brain .
the experiments are described in the review science translational medicine .
the previous vaccines against the tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies .
the injections were to be repeated so frequently so that the levels of antibody remain high that they were too expensive and not very practical .
but the cost of the new vaccine should be quite lower because it transforms the cells of the liver into antibody factories .
professeur crystal declared that if the future vaccine of human use were completely sure , one could manage it with the children before they are tempted to test a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction with nicotine .
but it is more probable than it is used by the smokers who want to stop smoking .
“ they will know that if they start again to smoke , they will take there no pleasure because of the vaccine anti-nicotine , and that will be able to help them to lose their bad habits ” , he added .
british scientists declared that the results were interesting but announced that research much thorough was necessary .

tripodi denies to be influenced by obeid
the labour former minister of news-wales of the south joe tripodi will be the object of an investigation of the regulator anti-corruption of the state .
the former minister of news-wales of the south joe tripodi denied to have modified the policy of business leases at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who had interests hidden in three goods located in the controlled area by the government .
friday , independent commission against corruption ( icac ) widened its investigation to know if mr. obeid had put pressure on several ministers for the state to renew his beams in circular quay , where obeid have two restaurants and a coffee , after their expiry in august 2005 , without there being invitation to tender .
she inquires from now on into the allegations according to which mr. tripodi was with the current of the secret interest of mr. obeid in these properties , following the testimony of the former assistant general secretary of mr. tripodi , lynne ashpole , thursday .
during years of discussions started in 2005 , the government put pressure so that the beams are the object of an invitation to tender .
the tenants were against and also wanted durations longer .
in 2009 , the beams concerning the companies of circular quay , which paid to obeid approximately 2.5 m $ a year , were renewed without there being invitation to tender .
mr. tripodi , who was minister for the ports from february 2006 to november 2009 , was with the departure favorable to the invitations to tender .
but he denied to have changed his policy at the request of mr. obeid who , recognized mr. tripodi , claimed a change of the government policy as regards beams .
the transcription of phone conversations presented to the icac showed last calls in august and september 2007 between mr. obeid , mr. tripodi and steve dunn , a high official who had arrived at the ministry for the ports after having worked under the orders of mr. obeid to the ministry for the peaches .

“ not ” , mr. tripodi answered .
i do not remember what we discussed but in any case , it was not that .
in any case certainly not between me and mr. obeid .
faa : the air passengers can from now on use gadgets on board planes ( but not to pass a call with their mobile phone )
the passengers of the airline companies will be able to use their electronic devices of door with door for reading , working , to play games , to look at films and to listen to music – but not to speak on their mobile phone – under the terms of the new very expected directives published thursday by federal aviation administration .
but the passengers should not expect immediate changes .
the speed with which the change will be set up will vary from one airline company to another , declared the administrator of the faa michael huerta at the time of a press conference .
the airline companies will have to prove with the faa that theirs planes respect the new directives and that they updated the training manuals of the team members and the rules concerning the storage of the devices to be in conformity .
the faa declared that it had already received plans of certain airline companies aiming at widening the use of the electronic devices on theirs planes .
delta and jetblue are part of the companies which already subjected plans .
“ according to the plan , we could approve a widened use of the electronic devices very soon ” , the faa in a declaration indicated .
currently , the passengers must extinguish their smartphones , shelves and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed .
they are not supposed to relight them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and that the commander gives his green light .
the passengers are supposed to extinguish their devices at the time of the descent of the plane before the landing and not to relight them until the plane landed .
under the terms of the new directives , the airline companies whose planes are correctly protected from the electronic interferences will be able to authorize the passengers to use their devices during takeoffs , the landings and the bearing on the ground , declared the faa .
most new airliners and other planes which were modified so that the passengers can use wi-fi at more raised altitudes , should satisfy the criteria .
laura glading , president of association of professional flight waiting , is known as happy of these changes .
“ once the new policy put in work in full safety – and we will work in close collaboration with the carriers for that – it will be advantageous with everyone ” , explained glading in a declaration .
we are frankly tired to feel us as “ head nurses ” when it is about this question .
but it will be always interdict to connect itself to internet for surfing , to exchange e-mails and of sms or to download data below 10 000 feet , declared the agency .
the passengers will have to put their smartphones , shelves and other devices in plane mode .
thus still not of words with friends , the online game style scrabble which the actor alec baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when it was expelled with great noise of a plane of american airlines after having refused to extinguish his device whereas the device was parked with the door .
and the devices heavier as the laptops will have to always be arranged because they could wound somebody if they flew through the cabin .
the mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited .
the lawful power concerning the mobile phones belongs to federal the communications commission and not to the faa .
the faa can raise prohibition on certain electronic devices during takeoff and the landing
last month , mark rosenker of the national transportation safety board , national expert in transport safety on cbs news , declared that the mobile phones were always regarded as presenting a risk .
“ the mobile phones are truly a problem , not only because they could possibly create interferences with the instruments of navigation , but because we know , according to the fcc , that they could disturb the antenna-relays of mobile telephony if they are used on board ” , rosenker declared .
an industrial advisory committee created by the faa to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorizes a broader use of the personal electronic devices .
the pressure weighing on the faa was reinforced during last years to soften the restrictions relating to their use .
detractors such as the sénatrice claire mccaskill , d-mo . , support that there does not exist any safety reason valid for these prohibitions .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of the devices became omnipresent .
certain studies indicate that at least a third of the passengers forgets to extinguish their devices , or do it deliberately .
the faa started to limit the use of the electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interferences with the instruments of navigation and communication when the passengers transported fm radios , the gadget high-tech of then .
the new airliners depend much more of the electric systems that former generations of planes , but they are also conceived to resist the electronic interferences and are approved by the faa .
the airline companies have allowed their passengers to use wi-fi with altitudes of cruising for several years .
the planes modified to accommodate wi-fi systems resist the interferences also better .
the vast majority of the airliners should allow a broader use of the electronic devices under the terms of the new directives , declared huerta .
the electronic devices of today in general emit radio transmissions of power much lower than the former generations of devices .
the readers of e-books , for example , emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned .
but the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data .
amazon.com is part of those which put pressure for an easing of the restrictions concerning the use of the electronic devices by the passengers .
in 2011 , the officers of the company charged an airliner with readers of e-books kindle and made it fly to see whether there were problems , but there was none of it .
that inspired to the members of the advisory committee of the faa of the mixed feelings as for the question of knowing if the use of the devices presents or not a risk .
douglas kidd of the national association of airline passengers declared that he thought that the interferences coming from the devices were real , even if the risk were tiny .
other members of the committee declared that there exist only anecdotic reports emanating from pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of a plane , and that most between them are very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa authorizes the pilots to be requested from the passengers to extinguish their devices during the instrument landings under conditions of low visibility .
a group of the industry of the travel was pleased with the changes , calling them of arrangements full with good sense for travellers equipped with technologies .
“ we are happy that the faa recognizes that an experiment pleasant passenger is not incompatible with the security ” , roger dow , president and director of the u.s. travel association declared .
the rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board remain for the moment in force in australia
the australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their shelves and their smartphones during takeoff and the landing in spite of the gesture of the united states aiming at softening the regulation relating to the electronic devices .
federal aviation american administration left the open door to the american carriers for a change of their procedures so that the passengers can read e-books , look at videos or play games on their devices during the critical phases of flight provided that they are in mode “ plane ” .
the passengers can already do it during most of the flight , but of many people find painful not to be able to reach their e-books during takeoff and the landing .
the australian carriers examine the decision which obliges the american carriers to carry out an important work in order to respect the requirements , but indicated that they do not intend in the immediate future to change their procedures .
the civilian aviation safety authority also declared that it examined the announcement but stressed that the restrictions relating to the use of the electronic devices during the critical phases of flight were always in force in australia .
“ the casa does not have specific regulations governing the use of the electronic devices in the plane ” , she declared .
the question is the object of a regulation which obliges the owners of aircraft to guarantee the maintenance of the security permanently and the passengers to respect the security instructions given by the team members .
virgin , who already spoke in the casa about his intention to extend the use of his system of entertainment on board using wi-fi technology , was opened with a change , but declared that it would follow the regulator .
“ we would favorably accommodate a revision of the casa which would allow the use of the electronic devices because we really think that would improve the experiment customer now that we lay out ( of the system of entertainment on board using wi-fi technology ) on our planes ” , indicated a spokesperson .
qantas declared that she complied with for the moment the current rules .
“ in accordance with our current policy , the electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and the landing , and we do not intend in the immediate future to change that ” , she declared .
the decision of the faa applies to the american airline companies .
however , we are always interested by the lawful evolutions which could profit with the passengers , and we will examine closely the decision of the faa and the reasons of this one .
for the american carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline company to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
the carriers will have to show that theirs planes can tolerate radio operator interferences coming from electronic devices , just as to re-examine the handbooks , the equipment of formation , the programme of transport of hand luggage and the instructions provided to the passengers .
“ as soon as an airline company checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can authorize the passengers to use light portable electronic devices , like shelves , readers of e-books and smartphones at all the altitudes ” , the faa declared .
in the rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask the passengers to extinguish their aircraft during the landing .
the group also recommended that the heavier devices are arranged in full safety under the seats or in the top chambers during takeoff and the landing .
the cdc publishes advices on the allergies in the child bound for the schools
wednesday , the american center of control and prevention of the diseases published a series of directives indicating how to manage the food allergies of the children to the school .
it is the first series of hot lines that the us government publishes , since the number of children in suffering school age of food allergies strongly climbed .
a child on 20 in the united states suffers today from a food allergy .
the cdc discovered that the prevalence of the food allergies in the child had increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guide contains the information intended for the schools on the way of sensitizing the teaching staff and staff with the food allergies in the child , and on the way of treating them in the event of allergic reaction .
it also recommends to the schools to have a stock of épinéphrine – the auto--injector of epipen brand being most usually used – to be able to react quickly in the event of anaphylaxie mortal potentially .
the legislative assemblies of the states recently brought up to date the regulations to more easily allow the schools to have of the épinéphrine in stock .
the report also understands a list of the typical symptoms communicated by the children who have an allergic reaction .
the children can say , “ i have the feeling that something pricks me the language ” , “ i have the feeling to have a hair on the language ” or “ i have tinglings on the language ” .
much opposition to the medical assistance to die in the congress of the palliative care
the canadian congress of palliative care , which proceeds this week in ottawa , occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the government bill on the medical assistance to die in quebec .
it is the occasion for several associations of palliative care to reaffirm their dissension .
if all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their sufferings , besides being able to stay at home , very little of them would like to put an end to their days , according to a spokesperson of the canadian association of the palliative care , maryse bouvette .
if one focussed on the palliative care at canada , the approach of the euthanasia would become tiny .
the president of the network of the palliative care of quebec rejects also the government bill on the medical assistance to die .
if it is adopted , alberte déry worries about the consequences on the next generations .
“ which is the direction of the life ” , she regrets .
the majority of the houses of palliative care will refuse to help the patients to die , according to the vice-president of the alliance of the houses of palliative care , suzanne fitzback .
mrs. fitzback , so direct of the mathieu-wheat-savoy house in gatineau , estimates that the service would be in any event useless .
one never asks us : “ i want to die , give me an injection ” .
the director of the association of the palliative care of ontario , rick firth , believes that the government bill of quebec disorientates the population about the vocation of the palliative care .
he does not believe that ontario will encase the step .
on her side , the liberal deputy of gatineau , stéphanie vallée , affirms that the concept of end-of-life will have to be clarified before the bill is adopted .
halloween 2013 : in figures
when i was small , halloween was magic .
my sister and me were authorized to eat candies , with going to lay down us late and disguising us to go in the vicinity .
today , i became more skinflint .
these two last years , i did not distribute only one candy and i will certainly not do it more this year .
but the statistics show that i am the black sheep when one speaks about halloween .
the majority of the americans – 158 million of them makes some – will celebrate halloween this year , spending a total of 6.9 candy md $ , disguises and decorations , according to the national retail federation .
until i impatiently wait each festival of halloween , they are the trends .
the disguises should account for 1.2 md $ out of the 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , the inanimate sexy objects make fury .
the women do not need more to be the professional sexy ones ; they can also be sexy food like pizzas , hamburgers and carrots .
as regards the men , i expect to see many zombies , thanks to the televised series the walking dead , and i bet that the men of the space of daft punk will appear among our instagram photographs this year .
according to google , the most required disguises are the zombies , batman , the pirates and the witches .
i suppose that there is no evil to remain traditional .
we disguised our dogs last year and , with my great astonishment , they were not only .

concern related to the security in mozambique grows at the same time as of the conflicts burst between powerful personalities
with the feet of the statue of samora machel , founder president of mozambique , measuring them , thousands of people gathered in the center of maputo to stress peaceful slogans at the time of a rare public demonstration .
“ we want that peace returns ; we want stability ” , declared vanessa de sousa , chief executive officer of an investment company .
worry for the future of its country , it exchanged its working clotheses against a t-shirt being marked “ we want the portuguese security ” before joining the crowd piled up on the place of the independence of the capital thursday .
during two weeks , practically the every day ago of the reports mentioning conflicts between the governmental forces and renamo , the worst fixings since the peace agreement which was signed there is more than 20 years .
renamo was formerly a famous rebel movement , constant at the beginning by rhodesia controlled by white then the government of apartheid of south africa within the framework as of efforts to destabilize the government independent of the country .
after a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
the analysts think that the country should not fall down in an opened conflict , but the recent events shook the foreign investors and the local population .
the challenge is considerable for the economy in full growth since the discovery of enormous gas reserves offshore oil rig and coal layers in the north-west could attract more than 50 md $ of investments during next years coming from companies like rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni d &apos;italie and anadarko of the united states .
frelimo , the party in power and the political main force since 1975 , and renamo are rejected the responsibility for the tensions mutually .
renamo declares that the government is at the origin of the recent confrontations and that he launched an attack against his members in the province of sofala , a traditional bastion of renamo , on october 17th .
the attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the governmental forces tackled the bases of renamo and tried to kill afonso dhlakama , the leader of the group , and fernando mazanga , the spokesperson of renamo , according to financial times .
the government makes renamo responsible to have started the conflicts , and shows it to attack soldiers .
president armando guebuza sought to minimize concerns concerning instability .
mr. guebuza declared wednesday in afp , the french news agency , that mr. dhlakama regarded himself as a “ loser ” who wanted to use “ all the forces that it remained to him to try to prove that it could impose his decisions on the government ” .
frelimo and renamo insist to say that they wish both to avoid the war .
but concern grew after mr. mazanga declared that renamo gave up the peace agreement of 1992 .
he declared with the ft that he wanted to say that the agreement was not respected any more by frelimo .
“ we want to resume negotiations , but with largest serious ” , mr. mazanga indicated .
the previous discussions between the parts did not succeed in alleviating the tensions supplied with a series of conflicts this year .
“ they are two great men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who do not stop disputing ” , explained joseph hanlon , a lecturer of the open university and specialist in mozambique .
none them can negotiate well and none them is ready to make the concessions necessary .
renamo , which is in favour of electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections in november having to take place .
the presidential and legislative elections are envisaged the next year .
certain commentators have interpreter his use of the force like the attempt at a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure on behalf of the government .
the share of the votes collected by renamo does not cease dropping since 1992 , while a new party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) which was created by a former member of renamo , should obtain one plus a large number of votes with the elections .
mr. mazanga said that mr. guebuza – who should withdraw himself at the end of its second mandate the next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country .
“ he does not want a democracy multi-party , he does not want elections transparent , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency ” , mr. mazanga declared .
one does not know exactly which is the capacity of renamo , but she conducted disturbing attacks flash on the police stations and the vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis .
most fixings took place in the province of sofala , which is located at several hundred kilometers north of maputo , but where beira is , the port from where mining companies , in particular rio tinto and vale , export coal .
in june , rio could not any more use the railroad during approximately a week after renamo threatened to attack the railway line .
mr. mazanga was wrongfully timid when it was asked to him whether renamo would reiterate this threat .
renamo wanted “ to inform the international community that the things do not go well to mozambique ” , mr. mazanga indicated .
instability reinforced frustrations which the government causes , declares fernando lima , director of mediacoop , an independent company of media , many people being also worried by corruption , the slowness of the development and the recent wave of removals .
“ people think that the persons in charge of the future of the country are the government and the president , and that is with the latter to find solutions with the problems ” , he explained .
omar sultuane , a demonstrator , said that people wanted only stability .
“ nobody worries about renamo nor of frelimo , they want just to find peace , they want to have a free access with the roads ” , he added .

coulson used the telephone hacking to check a pipe
the former editor-in-chief of news of the world andy coulson would have used “ the telephone hacking , the monitoring and confrontation ” to try to then confirm a bogus pipe on a connection implying the home secretary in exercise , charles clarke .
the prosecutor andrew edis qc declared in front of the court of old bailey that news of the world had heard a false rumour in may 2005 according to which clarke had a relation with hannah pawlby , his “ pretty special advisor ” .
it was announced to the court that the newspaper charged glenn mulcaire , a private detective , to pirate the voice mail of pawlby and “ to plant permanently in front of its door ” , but coulson also called it and left him text messages .
“ the charge suggests that mr. coulson , who is from now on the editor-in-chief of notw , is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house of people while hoping to surprise them , it is the kind of man to like to present the history to people to see what they say ” , mr. edis declared .
he declared that notw used three means to inquire into the subjects : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .
the editor-in-chief is personally implied in the third .
it is obvious that it is with the current of the second , the monitoring , it cannot be about it differently .
but what of it is it first ?
is he aware of the telephone hacking ?
he affirms the opposite , but we say “ of course that if ” .
the rumours on a connection implying clarke were taken again in first by the office of the drafting of notw when a source , testing a sexual attraction towards miss pawlby , declared that one had told him : “ do not waste your time with it , it is with charles . ”
a band , on which text messages pirated on its telephone with at least three recoveries were recorded , was seized in the residence of mulcaire in august 2006 .
the investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective which concerned miss pawlby and his sister arranged in a file “ projects ” .
for the period when the detective inquired into it , the grandparents of miss pawlby received anonymous calls where one asked them for information on it , mr. edis added .
meanwhile , the old one to defer in chief neville thurlbeck and the old one to defer james weatherup supervised the monitoring of least action of miss pawlby .
in a text message that it left him on june 18th 2005 , coulson said : “ i have a history which we envisage to publish tomorrow about which i would really like to speak to charles . ”
mr. edis explained that the implication of coulson in the history followed the same diagram as with other important men , such as the former minister for the interior david blunkett .
the jury heard thursday that coulson had confronted mr. blunkett about a connection with a married woman whereas itself attended the co-defendant rebekah brooks , who was also married at that time .
coulson and brooks deny to have conspired with others to pirate telephones between on october 3rd 2000 and on august 9th 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup admitted to have carried out telephone hacking .
rescue plan of 325 m $ intended for the health care system of tasmanie
the federal government maintains that the rescue plan of 325 m $ intended for the wavering health care system is matched strict conditions aiming at guaranteeing that the government of the state will not waste the funds .
the minister federal for health tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth currently takes “ urgent measures ” to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
the financing , envisaged over 4 years , was decided afterwards of the consultations of the government with the deputy independent of tasmanie , andrew wilkie .
“ the government proposed an emergency rescue plan which , according to us , will regulate the single difficulties with which the state is confronted ” , mrs. plibersek declared today .
the plan of 325 m $ understands a campaign of 31 m $ for nonurgent surgical operations .
2 600 additional operations , in particular in the field of the orthopedic surgery and the cataract , will help to make up for lost time .
funds are also planned for the private clinics without go to hobart and launceston , of better external care , the medical service , management training dedicated to the mental health and the deployment of systems of electronic medical records in the local hospitals .
“ these investments answer the idea according to which , according to the clinicians of first line , it is the best means of looking after the health care system of tasmanie ” , mrs. plibersek declared .
the minister affirmed that the government of tasmanie would be confronted with a strict mode of preparation of the reports and reporting .
the state will have to maintain the levels of financing current in order to receive money of the commonwealth and to prepare monthly reports on the sectors where he spends the additional funds .
a composite commission of three people will be made up to guarantee that the state provides the services in the most effective and efficient way possible .
mr. wilkie said today that the 325 m $ will not count for large-thing “ unless they are followed of a true reform making it possible to consolidate the public health care system of tasmanie ” .
he nevertheless congratulated the government to have answered at the request of urgent assistance that he presented to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i hope that the plan of federal assistance will largely contribute to withdraw the public health care system of tasmanie of the blacklist ” , mr. wilkie declared .
according to the government of the state , these additional nonurgent procedures will reverse the recent cuts mainly .
but the spokesperson of the opposition as regards health peter dutton thinks that the announcement of today is “ a makeshift solution ” .
“ the reason for which we are here is that the worker government of the state withdrew 430 m $ of its health care system ” , he declared on abc tv .
one cannot have a government of the state which tears off almost a half-milliard of dollars and the commonwealth which puts 300 m $ , and claim that it is one ostentation day .
mr. dutton visited mrs. plibersek to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy .

dr. georges bwelle exempts free health care in the villages of cameroon
dr. bwelle and his team pass almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
there are not many doctors in this country of west africa , hardly 1 per 5 000 inhabitants .
vote here or via your portable device
dr. georges bwelle is one of the 10 cnn heroes of the year 2013 .
you can vote for him , or one of the 10 other heroes , to elect it “ cnn hero of the year ” .
this person will receive 250 000 $ to continue her extraordinary work .
during 21 years , georges bwelle looked at his sick father alternating the periods of conscience and unconsciousness and going in hospitals which were not equipped to come to him to the rescue .
jamef bwelle was wounded in an automobile accident in 1981 close to yaounde , the capital of cameroon .
at the beginning , it had only one broken arm , but it contracted an infection which was propagated to its brain , creating a bruise of which it was going to carry the after-effects the remainder of its life .
“ there were no neurosurgeons in cameroon ” , georges bwelle declared .
we would have taken it along abroad if we had had enough money .
instead of that , dr. bwelle spent the years to accompany his father in crammed private clinics and hospitals , so that it obtains any treatment of which it could profit .
“ it is not easy ” , mr. bwelle adds .
you can leave the house at 5 : 00 , you ruer at the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
there are many patients .
people can die because they wait too long .
the situation did not change much since the death of the father of dr. bwelle in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the world health organization .
as comparison , the ratio in the east united states of 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants .
and even if they could see a doctor , many cameronians could not pay the consultation .
two people out of five in the country live below poverty line , and almost three quarters of the health expenditure of the country are carried out in the private sector .
“ the only problem that they have , it is poverty ” , explained dr. bwelle .
and because of poverty , they cannot benefit from the life .
after having seen his father and as many his compatriots to suffer , dr. bwelle was determined to try to change the course of the things .
dr. georges bwelle and his team of voluntary practised more than 700 surgical acts free during last year .
he became doctor himself , working as vascular surgeon at the central hospital of yaounde .
and it created a humanitarian association with nonlucrative goal , ascovime , which goes in the rural areas during the weekends to exempt free health care .
since 2008 , him and its group of voluntary helped nearly 32 000 people .
almost all the vendredis , with about thirty people , they pile up in light vans after having fixed medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult grounds to go in the villages which have more the need for assistance .
the chance always does not follow them .
they many times had to push the vehicles to cross muddy rivers or tracks .
but when they arrive , they are received as hero : the community organizes a festival , sings and dances and offers the best residences available to them .
in these villages , the free health care is a good reason to have fun , and dr. bwelle – with his great smile and its overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities .
the next morning , the team starts to receive hundreds of patients .
“ we receive 500 people with each visit ” , mr. bwelle declared .
they live sometimes to 60 km of the village , and they come on foot .
in this itinerant hospital , various health care is lavished .
many people receive a treatment against paludism , tuberculosis , malnutrition , the diabetes , the parasites and the sexually transmitted diseases .
others can receive crutches , a pair of glasses collected or a free certificate of birth – required document to go to the school , but from many poor families cannot be quite simply allowed to buy it .
the evening , the team practises simple surgical acts under local anaesthesia .
the operations are in general practised in a school , a town hall or a house ; after the intervention , the patient rises and goes in the recovery room to give up his seat to the following person .
thanks to the lighting of the generator , the operating room and the sterilization of equipment , dr. bwelle and his voluntary work until the first hours of sunday morning .
it is an exhausting rhythm , but the musicians of the villages help the team in general to remain justified .
“ they strike drums all the night to hold us waked up so that we can continue to work ” , explained mr. bwelle .
sunday , the team turns over downtown , tired but proud of the work which it achieved .
the group , composed cameronian doctors and medical students , practised 700 surgical acts free during last year , and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those of which they come to the rescue .
a man explained that the free operation that it had undergone to look after a hernia would make it possible him to work again .
“ that will change my future and that of my family ” , the man declared .
besides making live this itinerant hospital and to work as surgeon at the hospital , dr. bwelle works also during the night in doctor &apos;s offices deprived around yaounde .
it is this second employment , he explains , which finances to 60 % its association ; the rest is covered by private gifts .
“ i do not know when he sleeps ” , declared katie o &apos; malley , student in medicine in second year from the university drexel in philadelphia and voluntary within the group of dr. bwelle .
it is always at the hospital or trying to find money for its association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
for the medical students and the student male nurses like katie o &apos; malley , who come from the united states and europe to join mr. bwelle in his missions , it is an occasion of training on the ground which they do not have on their premises .
“ one could take part in operations to help to sponge blood or to make pass the instruments to dr. bwelle ” , explained miss o &apos; malley .
it is not something which you have the occasion to make in america when you are medical student in second year .
the voluntary students in general pay their travel to cameroon , and often arrive with collected medical equipment .
but once in yaounde , their pension , their transport and teaching are dealt with by doctor bwelle .
“ it is a hero , it does not have there a doubt ” , katie o &apos; malley declared .
it gives its life for this association , and its desire for helping the cameronian people is not close dying out .
for dr. bwelle , the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty .
to help the others to live happy by keeping the promise which it made to his father is something which brings an immense joy to him .
“ i am so happy when i do this work ” , mr. bwelle added .
and i think of my father .
i hope that he sees what i do .
to make laugh people and relieve the pain are the reasons which push to me to do that .

both france of pierre nora
perplexed , the academics a long time pained to define and locate pierre nora .
professor in the amphitheatres and the classrooms ?
undoubtedly , but by underlining its weak for the science-po , short cuts , advanced studies .
referee of works of others in its office of the street gaston-gallimard ?
indeed , but by being unaware of hidden work and the underground writing of the editor .
heir to the armchair which did occupy fontenelle with the french academy ?
admittedly still , but by knowing that such a sacring could not replace genuine holy oil , that of the thesis , from which it occurred .
they readily recognized in him a large eveillor , presenter and federator of their work , but while pointing out that it was shown not very inclined to produce itself of it .
with this dubious image the monument of the “ places of memory ” , to which it attached its name , also contributed .
there the scandalmongers could see a gigantic flea market , presented by a commentator intelligent , equipped with a sharp glance and ballasted of scholarship , but incurably dilettante .
the two works published by nora here soon two years already established that which passed not to write had written much and well .
the book that here should return justice definitively to him .
one however finds there , once more , the temptation of ubiquity , intellectual vagrancy , the jubilation put to jump as to feet together of a subject to the other .
but it is understood quickly that the disparate objects gathered in this book with the so beautiful title bring back the second-hand dealer to only one and even passion : that to discover the node constitutive of the french identity .
why these dramatic calls to the national unit ?
identity : it is a concern of time .
here little , we were collectively invited to give a definition of it .
but in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of then , the french identity was a timeless petrol .
one only had to deploy the accidents of them , and the business , jacobinism oblige , were entrusted to the prefects and to the sub-prefects , to interpreters authorized .
that which tracking pierre nora is very different .
it is not posed of heir to an eternal francity , it refuses with the definition .
anxious analyst of a familiar strangeness , it wanders in a forest of symbols , decree to each step by an object in the form of rebus , tormented irritating questions .
of which this one , which is born from the company itself : why , in a country so durably installed in its borders , so in the past framed and firmly built , one hears these dramatic calls to the unit ?
they are not so pressing , suggests pierre nora , that to entreat the disorder born of the discords of the french history .
francs and gallic , armagnacs and burgundian , catholic and protestant : the forces of division , here , are very old .
and most emblematic is obviously that which splits into two the national history .
as from the earthquake of the revolution , the french have two stories and they have two nations , one monarchical , the other revolutionist .
second death of the first wanted , but without managing to deny it ; concerned contrary to finding of it the sacredness and all the more avid of unit and indivisibility which it had cut the head to that which was the obvious one and powerful incarnation .
and , from there , an invincibly binary nation , shared between left and right-hand side , secularity and catholicism , worship and hatred of the revolution .
to make feel this singularity of the french identity , nothing is worth the four steps out of the hexagon , so that the american escapade of pierre nora wellness the heart of its book could .
because america and france and the other did one a revolution , written a declaration of the rights , wanted to found a new company .
but the american cousinhood does nothing but better underline what is clean for us .
over there , men who had left their former regime in england and did not have to be concerned with it any more .
here , encumbered of an indigenous former regime , and all the more radical men .
there a consensual revolution when here it sowed the drama and the candied one .
there always honoured founding fathers , and here of the revolutionary ancestors which one pains to make models , and who moreover between-committed suicide .
there an institutional constancy , and here a cascade of constitutions , like as many errors being caught up with and of tests to be begun again .
france which from goes away , france which comes
however a time ago when the french believed to be able to sew on again the torn dress of their history , and to overcome the curse of the figure two .
with this 3rd republic , central and creative moment , pierre nora much interest and even tenderness showed : greeting those which then got busy to repair the revolutionary fracture , by teaching with the schoolboys all that in old france prepared modern france obscurely and in their proposer a unified version of their history .
but this pacified identity had only a time .
here again discusses it , hustled by an immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of claiming minorities , absorptive in european space .
the book thus offers at the same time the fascinating portrait of france which from goes away and the circumspect draft of france which comes .
with , in bonus , the portrait of the historian , who should book some surprises .
it is discovered there that the tramp was a stay-at-home type .
the man of multiple curiosities turned , slightly obsessional , around the same idea .
the prowler of edges was held with the center of the center .
and that which had deposited , here more than one half-century , a subject on the idea of nation , but had been withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the thesis , entrusts to us , cum grano salis , which it will have ended up doing it .
admittedly in a less stiff form , more burst and more subtle .
but let us not mislead there we , quite as constraining .

finished the passwords to be typed to reach its smartphone or to pay its purchases ?
the american , french researchers or japanese predict a future to us where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of the telephones and the computers .
bernard didier , executive vice president of morpho , even estimates that “ the century will be biometric ” .
only biometrics will make it possible to make sure of the identity of a person realizing of the transactions in a as transverse and transnational universe as internet .
the organizations dedicated to protection of privacy confirm this passion for biometrics , but worry some .
only in 2011 and in france , the national commission of data processing and freedoms authorized 774 systems of recognition of the prints , of the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies , administrations , canteens …
“ everyone could be identified soon , anywhere and any time ” , is moved justin brookman , person in charge of the private life of the consumers within the cdt ( center for democracy and technology ) , in washington .
reasons of such an optimism , at the ones , and pessimism , at the others ?
biometrics will be based on novel methods , which will make it possible to do new favours for the citizens and to the consumers .
today , in france , the most used biometric data are the digital fingerprints , the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or the fingers .
but each one of these techniques has its constraints .
“ for example , certain people who work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their prints are illegible ” , philippe robin , works manager of the identity field in thales communications &amp; security notes .
and the collection as well as the checking of the venous network and the contour of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture people .
it is at the same time a security - one cannot collect these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage : the procedure must sometimes be repeated and thus takes time .
consequence , of research have been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches , like the recognition of the face or the iris ( the coloured part of the eye ) .
thanks to the increase in the precision of the sensors and of capacity of calculation of the computers necessary to the data analysis , these techniques become operational .
the precision of the facial recognition was multiplied by ten during five last years , calculates cyrille bataller , director of the laboratories of r &amp; d of accenture in europe .
with our assistance , the united kingdom and holland deployed automatic border posts using the facial recognition .
it is from now on possible to identify a face or an iris moving .
“ today , we undertake researches on the recognition of the voice or the way of walking using sound sensors , but one needs a quiet environment ” , indicates sridhar iyengar , director of research on the security in intel labs .
single and unfalsifiable marker , the dna also raises hopes and concerns .
“ in the actual position of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data ” , confirms sophie vulliet-tavernier , director of the studies , the innovation and the futurology with the cnil .
but the analysis of the dna is still very long and very expensive .
nec proposes at the police services legal a bag costing 90,000 euros to analyze samples of dna on the place of a crime and in one hour .
the uses of biometrics are divided into two groups : identification ( to recognize a person among others ) and authentification ( to make sure that the person is that which she claims to be ) .
the identification related to until now the identity papers delivery : it is necessary to confront the biometric elements ( impressed , photograph , iris ) with information which the state has on all the already driven citizens .
that makes it possible to make sure that a person does not try to usurp the identity of someone else .
this principle of comparison can have other applications .
nec thus proposes the recognition of vip at the entrance of a hotel or a store .
“ we recover the images of the surveillance cameras and let us compare them with the photographs celebrities who circulate freely on internet ” , explains dany nassif , charged , at nec france , of the commercial development for the solutions of biometric identification .
another use : to take in photograph a fellow which makes the tail in a store , to follow its progression thanks to the facial recognition and to calculate the latency .
the authentification related to at the beginning the physical accesses ( protected borders , buildings , canteens … ) or logics ( opening of a computer ) .
was added there , more recently , the control of presence .
“ pointer biometric avoids the phenomenon of the buddy who points for another ” , cyrille bataller justifies , from accenture .
but , more and more , the authentification will also relate to the transactions , in particular those carried out starting from devices connected to internet .
in japan , it is already possible to withdraw money with certain distributors by introducing its map and by posing its hand on a biometric reader : this gesture replaces the striking of the pin number .
a similar technique is tested in villeneuve-d &apos;ascq and angouleme by the company natural security in partnership with banks and signs of large distribution : at the time to pay in store with his credit card , the customer does not type his code , but introduced his finger into a reader who scans the veins .
the experimentation is designed to last six months .
if it is conclusive , the biometric readers could arrive soon in the french tradesmen .
tracks to reassure the users
there exist three manners of making biometrics tempting to the eyes of the general public .
first is to explain that it can make save time .
“ if , thanks to biometrics , a customer remains in case thirty seconds of less , it is appreciable ” , explains the director of a large surface .
second is to offer personalized services : in a few years , a vocal waiter will be able to recognize your voice and to propose custom-tailored options to you .
and , finally , to reassure by proposing the precautions taken to protect the databases .
“ the digital fingerprints are stored on a first waiter ; the identities of the people are in one second base : the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case , which is blocked if one tries to move it ” , enumerates philippe robin , from thales .
but , for lack of in-depth studies , it is impossible to know if these speeches convince really the users .
the specialists in protection of privacy , them , continue to worry .
“ progress of the facial recognition , the multiplication of the surveillance cameras and the enormous quantity of photographs available on facebook , flickr or picasa , make me fear the worst : a generalized monitoring ” , predicted andrew patrick , police station with protection of privacy in canada .
frontier airlines plans to make pay the hand luggage
frontier airlines plans to make pay up to 100 $ with the passengers who transport hand luggage on his flights .
frontier airlines plans to start to make pay up to 100 $ for a hand luggage and 2 $ for a coffee or a soda , although in its announcement wednesday , it indicated that the passengers could carry the quill nonopen with them to the descent of the plane .
the new expenses of hand luggage relate to the bags arranged in the top chamber , therefore the small bags installed under the seat will be always free .
frontier declared that it would make pay 25 $ if the expenses were paid in advance and 100 $ if the travellers did not pay that once with the door of loading .
the spokesperson of frontier , kate o &apos; malley indicated that the 100 $ were designed to encourage the travellers to pay the expenses in advance .
“ we do not want to make pay this price ” , she explained .
the airline companies started to make pay the first and second checked-in baggage in 2008 .
the passengers who tried to avoid these expenses put as many things as they could in the hand luggage arranged in the top chambers , thus it did not have there often more room in these compartments .
these expenses are a means of making sure that the passengers transport less things on board .
o &apos; malley declared that these new expenses will not be really used to collect money .
it is a question of rendering comprehensible with the most faithful customers of frontier which it becomes increasingly difficult to find of the place in the top chambers .
the passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the airline company will not have to pay .
thus , a passenger making the tail with a door of frontier loading could transport a bag free , while the following person in the tail could have to pay 100 $ for a similar bag .
o &apos; malley explained why the site and the procedures of recording of frontier are changing to guarantee that the passengers know the existence of these expenses before arriving at the door .
the expenses of hand luggage of frontier will not be applied before the summer , although no date was scheduled .
the passengers often grumble in connection with the expenses of luggage and other expenses , but the airline companies adore them .
they estimate that the costs of handling of the luggage are important and that the passengers who want this service should pay it .
a good amount of people with wall street consider the addition of expenses of luggage as a sign which proves that the airline companies make pay rather expensive to cover the cost of the air travel after years of losses .
however a good amount of between them did not touch at the expenses of luggage .
spirit airlines inc. the first expenses of hand luggage had applied three years ago , and the company low-cost allegiant followed a little later .
only the other company imposing such expenses is the hungarian company wizz air , declared the consultant near airline companies jay sorensen , who follows closely the expenses in supplement .
it estimated , in a report of december 2011 , that the expenses of hand luggage of spirit brought back 50 a year m $ .
sorensen , a former executive of midwest airlines , travelled recently on spirit and wondered what it was going to find with the door of loading at the time when the passengers would discover the expenses of unusual hand luggage imposed by the company .
“ i had never seen such a fluid procedure of loading of all my professional career ” , he declared .
i expected to see squeakings of teeth and a brawl to burst with the door .
the plane was full , he added , “ the passengers are assembled on board at the speed of the flash ” .
frontier also makes like spirit and applies expenses of 2 $ for a coffee , a tea , a soda or a fruit juice .
frontier indicated that the passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can carry the nonopen quill with them , and those which have coffee can be been used again free .
it will always distribute water free .
us airways tried briefly to make pay for drinks in 2008 but returned behind seven months later after the passengers complained and whereas no other large airline company had followed .
the decision of frontier to make pay expenses of hand luggage when the passengers directly do not buy their ticket near the airline company constitutes its last effort to encourage the customers to go on his site .
the airline companies online pay to the salesmen travel like orbitz 10 $ to 25 $ for each sold ticket .
that encouraged all the airline companies to encourage the passengers to buy directly near them instead of addressing itself at a travel agency online .
however , frontier went further in this field .
in september , it started to offer only half of miles of fidelity to the customers who bought their ticket via a travel agency online .
wednesday , it reduced the bonuses of miles of 25 % on a travel .
thus , a travel frontier de1 000 miles bought near a travel agency online would make it possible to gain 250 miles .
it also makes it possible to the passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they directly buy their ticket on the site of frontier .
frontier has faithful customers in his town of origin , denver , but its activity moves back and it loses money .
the receipts fell of 9 % and its capacity of flight decreased by almost 13 % during the first quarter , according to the financial results published wednesday by its parent company , republic airways holdings inc .
republic tried to rectify finances of frontier by selling the airline company .
scientists have just clarified the way in which the movements of the tail of a dog are related to its mood .
previous studies had revealed that the happy dogs more stirred up their tail towards the line ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while the nervous dogs stirred up it more towards the left .
but from now on the scientists say that the dogs can detect these subtle differences and to answer it .
professeur georgio vallortigara , neuroscientifique of the university of thirty , declared : “ everyone knows that , at the man , the left side and the right side of the brain are implied in a different way in the stimuli which wake up positive or negative emotions . ”
here , we tried to see what it was at other species .
he added that just as at the man , in the dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement towards the left and vice versa , and than the two hemispheres played a different part in the emotions .
more on the way in which the dogs react to the disordered movements of tail of other dogs , the researchers followed of the animals looking at films where appeared of other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior .
it will surely not be necessary a long time before we understand why their tail goes sometimes on a side and sometimes from the other .
professeur vallortigara explained : “ we presented to dogs of the films where appeared of other dogs – either a version naturalist or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we could adulterate the movement of the tail and present it like energy on the left or on the right . ”
when animals have seen dog without expression to stir up tail towards right-hand side ( from the point of view of the dog which stirs up the tail ) , they remained perfectly slackened .
but when they have located tail to deviate mainly towards left ( once again from the point of view of the dog which stirs up the tail ) , their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious .
professeur vallortigara said that he did not think that the dogs communicated deliberately between them thanks to these movements .
he thinks rather than the dogs know by experiment the movements of which they would have or should not worry .
he added : “ if you meet other dogs on several occasions and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their tail towards one on the east side associated with a friendlier attitude and that the right side involves a less friendly attitude , you will react according to this experiment . ”
the researchers indicate that the results could allow the owners , the veterinary surgeons and the tamers to better apprehend the emotions of their animals .
the expert in canine behavior john bradshaw , professor invited to the school of sciences veterinary surgeons of the university of bristol , specified that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right-hand side at the canine species .
last year , a team of the university of lincoln discovered that the dogs turned the head towards the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and towards the line when it was about a merry dog .
and in another scientific study carried out by the university of victoria in canada , he declared : “ the dogs went more easily towards a dog robot when its tail stirred up towards the left rather than towards the line , instead of becoming anxious – the reverse of what appears in the italian study . ”
it indicated that the differences could come owing to the fact that the dogs having taken part in the various studies entirely did not regard the animals of the films or the dogs robots as dogs .
a study on the way in which the dogs react vis-a-vis true dogs could be useful , he explained .
“ although many elements , raised in various mammals , indicate that the two sides of the brain are used at different ends , a good amount of details must still be specified – and the dogs do not make exception ” , he declared .
however , being given the facility with which their behaviors can be recorded , it will surely not be necessary a long time before we understand why their tail moves sometimes on a side and sometimes of the other .
launching of a shop of accessories for google knell
an online shop , proposer of multiple accessories dedicated to google knell , has just been put at disposal as of thousands of developers having a prototype of the signed connected glasses google .
they can thus acquire an ear-phone , a charger or even a case of storage .
this shop , strictly booked with the developers having google knell already , proposes some accessories such as a charger and his usb cable , for 50 $ .
for the same price , it is also possible to acquire a cover of protection manufactured in microfibres or an intra-auricular ear-phone .
although google currently works on a model of google knell equipped with glasses of correction , no date of marketing on a large scale was still confirmed .
to live together in french , the challenge of the school commission marguerite-bourgeoys
at the school commission marguerite-bourgeoys , 62 % of the pupils have a mother tongue other than french .
it is what justified , one year ago , a consultation near the parents , pupils , professors and staff members of education , to think of the means of better integrating the pupils who live with horse between several cultures .
the school commission has just revealed its vision of the “ french food together ” .
the organization vision diversity has walked for one year in the schools to help the pupils of any origines to discover common reference marks which are not limited to the french language .
the discovery of districts , our architecture , our places are reference marks .
great names of writers , artists , who they are of stock or which they came besides .
who are our builders ?
“ thus , projects are created so that they are identified with all that ” , explains the president of vision diversity , aïda kamar .
michel venne , of the institute of the new world , identified several challenges for the school commission .
“ on the transmission , for example , of what is the québécois culture , the feeling of membership , the support for staff in the transformations which one lives , within the student customers ” , he enumerates .
the school commission marguerite-bourgeoys created a research centre which will give tools to the professors who , also sometimes , come besides .
rachida azdouz , of the university of montreal , will be the scientific director .
preparation to manage a class in a north-american , québécois context .
“ different teaching strategies , it is that the true need ” , she summarizes .
research will relate to inclusion from every angle : linguistics , school , social and cultural .
obama puts an end to listenings aiming at the imf and the world bank
barack obama gave order to the national agency of security ( nsa ) to put an end to listenings which it practised on the funds international currency and the world bank within the framework of its activities of information , indicates an american official , thursday .
this decision is part of the attempt of the white house to take again the hand in the business of listenings of the nsa after the revelations made by the former analyst edward snowden , taken refuge in russia .
it is the first time that the monitoring of the imf and the world bank by the information agency is mentioned since the beginning of the scandal .
questioned on the subject , a person in charge of the american administration answered : “ the united states does not carry out electronic monitoring aiming the seats of the world bank and the imf at washington ” .
expressing itself under the seal of anonymity , this person in charge did not specify if such a monitoring had been installation in the past .
another official , indicated to him that barack obama had given order to cease these practices during past weeks .
this instruction was given about to the same fine moment as that putting at listenings of the general headquarter of uno in new york .
in this context , the senatorial commission of the information approved thursday a reinforcement of controls on the governmental programs of monitoring but authorized their continuation .
the commission founded new restrictions on the data which the information agencies are authorized to collect and imposed a five years limit for the conservation of this information .
the european stock exchanges drops some with the mid--meeting , except london
except for london , the principal european stock exchanges evolve in fall friday with mid--meeting , leaded by certain news of disappointing companies , while wall-street is expected in rise .
in addition , the investors remain careful because they estimate that american federal reserve could untie its policy of quantitative easing earlier than envisaged .
contrary , after the announcement of an inflation with 0.7 % for the whole of the euro zone , the idea is spread among the actors of the market that the european central bank ( ecb ) could soften its monetary policy .
the future ones of wall street let predict an opening of the american actions in rise , after two consecutive meetings of fold .
with the values , renault ( - 4.63 % ) records the strongest fold of cac 40 , leaded by the warning on result of its partner nissan motor friday .
royal bank of scotland ( - 6.26 % ) marks the worst performance of eurofirst300 , after having also published results drops some this morning and announced in-house creation of a structure of defeasance ( “ bad bank ” ) gathering 38 billion books of the riskiest credits .
on its side , vodafone ( + 2.45 % ) is maintained at the top of the rises of eurofirst300 in reaction to press information wanting that at &amp; t studies a possible tender offer .
on the foreign exchange market , the speculations on the evolution of the monetary policy of the ecb go good progress , as testifies some john hardy , strategist at bank sax .
the single mandate of the ecb always related to inflation , therefore mario draghi and his team have more reasons to act during the meeting of the next week .
we anticipate a strong potential of fall of the euro .
in this context , the euro continues its fold against the american dollar and touched during the meeting one low two weeks to 1.3517 dollar .
these same conjectures support contrary the bond market to the euro zone .
this judgement means that legal text adopted in july in this state and calling largely into question the right to the abortion will be able to come into effect .
classical song for teenagers
each time , it is the school customers which will be targeted , an initiative which had known much success during the former season .
through five playlets imagined and interpreted by artists of the area , labels comprising a strong amount of humour , one allows teenagers to tame the classical song .
in addition to this show , the company of lyric art of the kingdom will return with its lyric destinations , a formula which makes from now on full house in pulperie de chicoutimi .
two other concerts will take place at the summer 2014 , which gives the chance to artists of the area to show what they are able .
to these activities was added the lyric aperitif , the concert-benefit held last august , with the participation of the soprano coloratura marie-Ève munger .
it was about a activity-benefit , parallel to artistic dimension , and it helped the non-profit making organization to produce financial results which are as soft with the ears as an air of the bat .
without delivering precise figures , the president of the board of directors , yves bergeron , benefitted from the meeting of press held yesterday , in chicoutimi , to show itself reassuring .
in spite of the precariousness which is the batch of so many cultural institutions , the future takes shape well , even in the long run .
we have more solid and constant supports .
“ finances are with flood and we hope to last until the 50e birthday of the operetta , a stage which we will reach in seven years ” , the administrator commented on .
“ i would say even beyond ” , added the chief executive officer , hélène gaudreault , while smiling .
the congolese army pursues the rebels of m23
congolese army ( fardc ) announced thursday that its units were going to pursue the rebels of m23 until in their bases located in the forests and the mountains of north-kivu bordering on rwanda and uganda .
m23 appears about to be beaten after being driven out localities of the north-east of the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) which it controlled since the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insurrection .
“ we will continue m23 and will drive back it everywhere where it hides because they are criminals ” , declared at reuters colonel olivier hamuli , spokesperson of the fardc .
we should not let them reorganize because they martyrize the congolese people since too long .
time had just brought back peace .
persons in charge of m23 explained to have evacuated the localities under the diplomatic pressure and bertrand bissimwa , political official of the rebellion , affirmed on rfi that these military setbacks would not modify of anything its claims with the peace talks .
the latter , according to the ugandan mediators , began again wednesday in kampala between the government of kinshasa and m23 .
fixings are announced in the hills which dominate bunagana , the last locality with the hands of the insurrectionists to being fallen this week , like in the neighbourhoods of runyoni , a hill where the rebellion of m23 came out in 2012 .
with their apogee in november , the insurrectionists occupied gummed , chief town of the province of north-kivu , benefitting from the escape of the governmental garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of monusco .
the fall of gummed brought the most important mission of the united nations in drc , to the world in term of manpower , to reinforce its mandate and to form a fast brigade of made up intervention south-african soldiers , malawites and tanzanians .
on his side , the staff of the fardc was altered and the army passed to the offensive against m23 , making change the course of the war .
the rhythm of progression of the governmental troops is today without precedent .
“ m23 seems to touch at its end ” , predicted an expert of the congolese business , jason stearns , on his blog congo siasa .
it would be historical - it would be the first time that the government of kinshasa succeeds in beating a major insurrection .
and it would be as the first time since 1996 as no armed group combined in rwanda would be present in the east of the drc .
experts of the united nations show rwanda , which denies it savagely , to militarily support m23 , made up at the beginning of mutinous congolese former servicemen .
the chief of the british diplomacy , william hague , invited rwandan president paul kagame to show reserve , announced a spokesperson of foreign office .
last week , kigali had evoked the possibility of military reprisals following the shells fallen in rwandan territory .
wednesday , the inhabitants of bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of the soldiers of the fardc .
“ we lived one year with m23 and it appeared unimaginable to us to be one day released by the army ” , an inhabitant testifies to this locality bordering on uganda .
“ we lived in terror ( of m23 ) , we are traumatized ” , this man added .
john kerry admitted , made without precedent , that american espionage “ had gone too much far from inappropriate manner ”
john kerry indicated a rise in temperature of the defensive attitude of the united states with respect to his programmes of monitoring while admitting , made without precedent , that on several occasions , espionage “ had gone too much far from inappropriate manner ” .
the secretary of state also admitted that it had , just like barack obama , controlled on “ autopilot ” when a series of revelations flamers of the denouncer edward snowden about the activities of espionage of the nsa came out .
the escapes put the us government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
expressing itself at the time of an intergovernmental conference in london by video connection , mr. kerry declared : “ it is undeniable that the president , myself and other members of the government became acquainted with certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility of it , as of the second world war and until the difficult years of the cold war , then of course september 11th . ”
he became then the first member of high ranking of the government of the united states to admit that american espionage had exceeded the terminals , but insisted on the fact that the rights of each one had not been violated .
he declared : “ in certain cases , it went too much far from inappropriate manner . ”
and the president is determined to try to clarify and specify clearly with people who it proceeded now to a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels misled .
i ensure you that the innocent people will not be victims of abuse within the framework of this process .
mr. kerry insisted , however , on the fact that the nsa was a force acting for the good and that its operations of monitoring had saved many lives .
he added : “ we live in a new world where people are ready to be made jump . ”
there exists a radical extremism in the world which is given to try to kill out of people , to explode them and attack the governments .
and if you could intercept their communications and to stop them before they act ?
we indeed prevented planes from falling , buildings to explode and people to be assassinated because we could become acquainted with the facts in advance .
meanwhile , the american legislators will go to europe to answer the concerns concerning the business of supposed american espionage and to convince europeans of the need for continuing the joint efforts of fight against terrorism with the united states , explained thursday the president of the subcommittee of the senate on the european business .
the senator chris murphy of connecticut indicated that it had been expressed in front of the members of the european parliament and others this week and that it was anxious threats which they had uttered concerning a possible withdrawal of the organizations anti-terrorists because of the feeling of frustration that the monitoring of the national security agency causes .
“ it is really important for the protection of the national security in the united states which europeans remain at our sides in the mutual obligation in the fight against terrorism ” , declared murphy , a democrat serving its first mandate , and chair subcommittee of the european business of the american senate , during a maintenance from washington .
and i will go to europe for good to render comprehensible to them that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism , in spite of the anger caused by the programs of the nsa .
press reports that the nsa collected million communications in europe , which put at evil the relations with some combined of the united states , however the director of the agency declared this week that it was inaccurate and that it was about a misunderstanding because that related to metadata which the allies of nato had collected and shared with the united states .
other revelations mentioned documents revealed by snowden according to which the nsa had intercepted data and communications emanating of the mobile phone of the german chancellor angela merkel and those of 34 other heads of state .
the director of the intelligence services , james clapper , justified the espionage of the allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was about a common practice on the two sides .
in this atmosphere of tumult , murphy indicated that its office organized a travel of the congress , which should take place this year , and which he hoped for that the delegation would understand of the members of the two parties and the two rooms .
the names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the days to come .
it indicated that the route remained to be defined .
murphy declared that the goal of this travel was to make it possible to improve the relations , but also to show “ affectionate firmness ” .
he explained why the european heads of state were to be honest with their citizens about the type of programs of espionage which they apply themselves since years .
“ we can modify our programs of monitoring in order to better protect the rights of europeans , but they must as understand as we are not in the world to only make espionage ” , murphy declared .
meanwhile , mr. kerry envisaged to go this weekend to the middle east and to poland to manage the rancour generated by the american strategies in syria , egypt and iran , like by the activities of monitoring of the united states .
the call of rejected scott brown
scott brown , the captain of celtic glasgow , saw his rejected call and will be well suspended for both next matches of league of the champions of his club , against ajax and ac milan .
expelled against barça to have addressed a blow to neymar , the scottish medium saw its suspension extended to three meetings by the uefa .
in an official statement , its club was said “ very disappointed ” , estimating that its call was entirely justified .
for the chairman of titan , “ the project of purchase of goodyear amiens starts with zero employee ”
after having thrown sponge with crash in january for the recovery partial of the goodyear site of amiens-north promised closing , to maurice taylor , the chairman of the american tire maker titan , declares itself , today , ready to save 333 employment out of the 1,137 which account the factory .
arnaud montebourg , minister for the productive rectification , had already announced it , monday , october 21 .
after having given up the project of purchase of the factory in january , you return today .
you had pronounced violent attacks and insults , while speaking about “ so-called blue-collar workers ” , who “ work three hours ” per day , of “ insane ” trade unions , by aiming at cgt .
this volte-face is not understood .
is this to please mr. montebourg ?
i do not try to please anybody .
except with my wife .
mr. montebourg , is a charming young man who tries to save industrial employment among best paid .
if i wounded somebody by my words , i am sorry .
but france has a high level of tax and unemployment too .
does the truth wound you ?
to work seven hours per day when in other countries one works eight hours handicaps france .
in india , china and in full with other countries , one works ten to twelve hours per day .
but i do not have prejudices on france .
what i see , it is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires , has good equipment , is well located and has spaces to increase .
why titan does it need so much this factory ?
titan does not need to buy this factory .
but , with a correct price and qualified workers , that is worth the blow to test .
which type of agreement do you wait between cgt and goodyear ?
if , since the announcement of the closing of the factory , goodyear to the employees a good severance pay had offered , i think that 100 % of the employees would have accepted it .
now , let us imagine that titan buys in goodyear the closed factory .
consequently , titan could move the machines towards poland or any other country of the european union which still has its own currency .
i think that mr. montebourg knows that .
however , he wants to keep the factory of amiens with at least 333 well paid employment .
titan agrees to recruit them among the few 1,200 current employees of goodyear .
also mr. montebourg needs it a commitment of titan before trying to lead cgt to sit down with the table with goodyear .
the first stage is that cgt and goodyear seal an agreement on the severance pays for all the employees .
consequently , there will be no more employees in the factory .
mr. montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee this 333 employment during four years .
do you confirm it ?
the only number that i mentioned with the minister , it is 333 .
i know that he would like a four years warranty .
but , as i told you , cgt and goodyear must initially agree on severance pays .
if all the employees accept them , the project of purchase of the factory starts with zero employee .
how can we give guarantees of duration of employment when it does not remain more employees on the site ?
if mr. montebourg arrives so that cgt and goodyear agree and that titan buys the factory , we intend well to remain in amiens-north more than four years .
the airport of los angeles evacuated after a shooting
a shooting took place with the international airport of los angeles .
it was 10 : 00 of the morning local time when a man opened fire .
according to the local police , there would be at least 2 casualties .
it would be about an employee working for the administration for the transport safety of the united states ( tsa ) and the author of the shots .

the supreme court validates the law of reform of the health care system of obama
great victory for the administration obama : the american supreme court declared today that the law of reform of the health care system ratified by obama was constitutional .
by 5 votes against 4 , the judges validated the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act ( law on the protection of the patients and the care accessible ) – who requires that the citizens subscribe a health insurance by 2014 , under penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional under the terms of the power of imposition of the government .
the president of the supreme court , john roberts , joined himself the four most liberal members of the court , while judges scalia , thomas , alito and kennedy expressed their dissension .
court has also validated other sections of law of 2 700 pages and has , in addition , considered that provision of law of reform of health care system , which stipulates that it is necessary to lower the threshold of eligibility at medicaid under penalty of losing all the federal financings of the program , was coercive in accordance with the constitution .
the procedure aiming at blocking the law was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
all the large republican candidates with the presidential election in string during primary educations of 2012 , including the candidate designated mitt romney , savagely opposed the law .
aretha franklin will go up on scene in december
the newspaper news strait reports that the queen of the drunk person will occur on december 21st in the room sound board of the hotel motorcity casino .
mrs. franklin business in november with the recording of an album for clive davis and sony music , produced by don was and kenny “ babyface ” edmonds .
without specifying the disease of which she suffered , celebrates it interpreter of respect had affirmed with the media on october 16th which the side-effects of a treatment which she received were “ difficult ” .
she affirms being “ happy to be of return ” .
it would be necessary to teach the myths and legends with the children like “ models of lifestyle ” , the author declares .
the legend of thor could show that “ the brute force does not make the weight vis-a-vis the subtle trick ” , while the legends arthuriennes reveal the importance to have dreamed one .
saying that many myths would be “ well too violent one , well too scandalous and in certain cases , well too obscene to be taught at the school ” , crossley-holland recommended a “ meticulous selection ” of the works adapted to the age .
“ i find formidable that in america , the myths and the folklore are already part of education ” , he said .
i have pled in favour of this project for 20 years .
he added that the fact that the authors and the teachers “ didactic ” are openly made that the children “ take down completely ” , the messages “ being sublimated ” in pleasant stories .
crossley-holland , which translated beowulf of the anglo-saxon and wrote the penguin book of norse myths and folk british bruise , declared : perhaps “ you have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight . ”
perhaps that the great difference between an adult author writing for the adults and an adult author writing for the children is the need for offering hope .
not that all must be simplified or finish well , but there exists an innate direction of the good and evil .
and it must be sublimated ; revealed through a history rather than declared .
the known base of what one shows and which one does not say .

new request for collective appeal against the brothers holy-cross
a new request for collective appeal was presented against the brothers holy-cross , relating to sexual assaults which would have proceeded this time at the oratory saint-joseph like in several orphanages , colleges and schools .
the request is based on the testimony of the applicant , identified like “ j.j ” . , which would have been masturbated in the years 1950 , initially with our-lady-of-snows by its professor the subjected brother , then by his confessor , the father bernard , with the oratory saint-joseph , where it was being used as mass and where his / her father worked as painter .
the first recourse aimed only three establishments , and when the regulation was announced , much people told us : “ me , was i at such place , i can be registered ? ” , the lawyer alain arsenault tells , who defends the victims in both recourse .
the collective appeal which has just been deposited has as a characteristic to allow the addition of plaintiffs of any establishment where maltreatments could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of holy-cross .
at present , the recourse joins together the complaints of 25 people who affirm to be attacked by the brothers holy-cross .
the pled facts are in general older than those mentioned in the first recourse , since several of the establishments concerned closed down in the years 1960 .
the recourse underlines in addition that the congregation of holy-cross and the oratory saint-joseph , which is a distinct entity , “ allowed that sexual maltreatments are perpetrated against children ” , that they “ exerted a moral constraint , religious and psychological on the victims ” , that they “ were with the current of the perpetrated sexual maltreatments and nevertheless choked them ” , and that they “ knowingly and consciously chose to be unaware of the problems ” .
these last charges are based inter alia on letters written by lawyer of the brothers holy-cross , me Émile perrin , in the years 1990 , but also by the research made in the archives on this subject by the brother wilson kennedy , a former brother of holy-cross which denounced the maltreatments publicly .
the collective appeal must initially pass the stage of the admissibility in superior court .
once the allowed admissibility by the court , one proceeds at the second phase , that is to say hearings on the bottom .
in the case of the first recourse , the congregation of holy-cross had agreed to regulate by amicable agreement before hearings are carried out on the bottom .

mr. paluku envisages to go saturday has bunagana .
political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion , this locality is located at the ugandan border , approximately 80 km north of gummed .

the court blocks a decision relating to the policy of control and excavation of the nypd
a federal court of appeal blocked thursday the decision of a requiring judge of the changes in the checking routine and of excavation of the department of police of new york and dispossession of the file has it .
the court of appeal of the united states ( second circuit ) indicated that the decision of judge shira scheindlin was suspended until the exit of the call lodged by the city .
the judge had ruled in august that the city had violated the constitution following the implementation of its program aiming to control and question the citizens .
the city appealed against its conclusions and its corrective ordinances , in particular a decision aiming at allotting a controller to help the department of police to modify its policy and the training program which is associated for him .
the court of appeal heard the arguments tuesday relating to the request for suspension .
the court of appeal declared that the judge was to be dispossession of the file because it infringed the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge for avoiding any appearance of partiality , partly because of a series of talks granted to the media and public statements in which it reacted publicly to criticisms of the court .
the judge had ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil laws of tens of thousands of people by targeting black men and of hispanic origin within the framework of their excavation and checking routine .
it appointed an external controller to supervise the modifications , in particular the reform of the policies , formation and supervision , and it ordered the installation of a pilot program to test cameras related to the body in the districts where more a large number of controls proceed .
in august , the town of new york agreed to put an end to the practice consisting in preserving the names and addresses of the people whose case is rejected after police checks .
the hearing of the call lodged by the city should take place after march 14th 2014 .
the tactics of control and the excavation were criticized by many defenders of the civil laws .
this monitoring system and of excavation exists since decades in a certain form , but the number of recorded controls increased in a spectacular way under the administration of the independent mayor michael bloomberg , to reach his more historical high level in 2011 with 684 330 controls which concerned mainly black men and of hispanic origin .
a legal action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all coming from minorities , and was transformed into collective action .
the partisans preaching of the changes in and the excavation checking routine of the nypd say that they will put an end to the unjust practices , will allow to have more effective contingents of police and to which one trusts , and will be able to change the way in which the departments of police use of the policy .
the opponents say that these changes would undermine the moral one of the police without cause a drop in the crime , would represent a money wasting and would not solve the broader problem of contingents of police under pressure after manpower of police officers were strongly reduced during the last decade .
the judge stressed that it did not put fine at the practices of control and excavation , which are constitutional , but that it reformed the way in which the nypd implemented its controls .
the revelations of the nsa increase the paranoia of the companies with regard to the monitoring of state
by a beautiful day of the end of august , a helicopter of the german police flew over at low altitude the british consulate of frankfurt , the financial capital of germany .
on order of the federal office of protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the german national agency of information , its mission was to photograph the roof of the american outpost , located at less than 5 km of the european central bank and bundesbank .
the german media explain why bfv hoped to identify the presence of antennas of listening and that the operation caused an exchange between the united states and the german ministry for foreign affairs in berlin .
james clapper , the director of the american intelligence services , insisted again in september on the fact that the united states does not use their capacities as regards foreign information “ to steal the industrial secrecies of the foreign companies on behalf of us companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their benefit ” .
but since edward snowden , the consultant become denouncer , started to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrecies of the monitoring of the united states , the european governments and the managers of undertakings do not know any more if it is necessary to believe the director on word .
reports , according to which the national security agency american spied on the brazilian oil company petrobras and had access to data held by american suppliers of services of storage in cloud , in particular google and yahoo , more than ever caused the paranoia of the companies with regard to the monitoring of state .
the revelation according to which the telephone of the german chancellor angela merkel had been pirated , perhaps even during a decade , was the drop of water which made overflow the vase .
if the most powerful person of europe can be aimed , then the managers of undertaking are surely also potential targets .
snowden made transparent intensive collaboration between the american intelligence services and the companies .
i estimate that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest .
“ germany must awake ” , declares oliver grün , president de bitmi , who represents german sme of the sector of ti .
the german companies think that the united states represents a risk as important as china when it is of industrial espionage and flight of data , according to an investigation published in july by consultancy ey .
however in all the documents revealed by mr. snowden , nothing states to date that the united states transmitted industrial secrecies of foreign companies to us companies .
the politicians informed of their concern to the idea that the eu do not have data-processing capacities and internet sufficient and think that it should endeavour to reduce her dependence with respect to the united states .
the managers of undertaking are skepticals on this subject .
a deputy of the german parliament said that we should create a google german .
i can only close the eyes and slowly reopen them …
“ it is not the good way of making ” , indicates hasso plattner , president of the software company of german company , sap .
if one wanted an industry european of ti strong , then one did not have to let it die 20 years ago .
all is subsidized in germany , of coal to the cars , via the farmers .
all except the industry of ti .
however , the extent and the sophistication of the american agencies of espionage exposed by the revelations of snowden were a shock for certain companies which thought hitherto that china represented the largest risk in terms of monitoring .
a large change is occurring in data processing in cloud since the european persons in charge became aware owing to the fact that the data preserved at the united states are controls under the terms of the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey conducted by cloud security alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of the nonamerican members gave up their projects to use an american supplier of services of storage in the cloud after the revelations on the american programme of exploration of the prism data .
jim snabe , deputy manager of sap , declares : “ our customers put a question today to us that they did not pose to us one year ago : where my data are preserved and can you guarantee to me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction ? ” .
many german leaders indicate that the last reports are only one confirmation of what they knew already , namely that the powerful states want to steal their most invaluable secrecies and that these data must consequently be kept at all costs .
it is not surprising that there is economic espionage .
there always was of it .
“ it is a recurring subject since many years and nothing basically changed within the framework of the current discussion ” , declares kurt glass of bier , chief executive officer of the film company of chemical products basf .
the americans spy on us on the commercial plan and industrialist just like let us spy on we them , because it is in the national interest defend our companies .
the managers of undertaking are generally not very inclined to reveal the preventive measures which they installation , if that would leave the advantage to an adversary .
the large companies for a long time hammer the message according to which it is at the very least imprudent to recover a free usb key at the time of a trade show or to leave a laptop without monitoring in a hotel room .
ulrich hackenberg , member of the board of directors of the audi car manufacturer , declares that the collection of the mobile phones before the meetings of the council , so that they cannot be used like devices of remote listening , is a common practice since years .
bfv of germany advises with its leaders to plan to use simple mobile phones prepaid at the time of their travel abroad because of the risk of attack to the integrity of the smartphones .
the prepaid mobile phones are then thrown .
however , it is feared that the small and medium-size companies remain vulnerable to the hacking and the monitoring .
in germany , a good amount of sme are world leaders in their particular niche .
“ sme often miss experiment , of staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrecies against an unauthorized access ” , bfv in a report informs .
the united states alerts their own companies on the economic activities of espionage carried out by other countries .
the national estimate intelligence ( denies ) carried out in february by the united states , quoted france , just as russia and israel , culprits with the second degree to have carried out acts of hacking of economic information , behind china , according to the washington post .
a member of the board of directors of a famous german company estimated that when it is about economic espionage , “ the french are the worst ” .
bernard squarcini , old directing of the french interior information , the dcri , declared in a maintenance this month : “ the services know perfectly well that all the countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , spy on their allies . ”
a tax on the foreign real owners to make burst the bubble of london
the treasury quantified temporarily the measurement of the tax on the capital gains but expects a definite decision of mr. osborne which , in the budget of 2012 , registered an excise tax of 7 % for the properties costing more than 2 m £ and of the annual expenses for the purchasers who choose to rather hold properties within the framework of a company than to in an individual capacity .
the excise tax applies already to the residential properties of the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , and accounts for 708 m £ on the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , which exceeds the full amount of northern ireland , of wales , of scotland , of the north-east , the north-west and the region joined together yorkshire terrier and humber .
mr. cook declared : “ following the increase in the excise tax on the properties of great value and the introduction of the law anti-avoidance on the matter , it is very difficult to advance that the properties of great value under-are imposed independently of the effects of the system of obsolete tax of dwelling . ”
“ but this change could make the foreign investors reticent to the idea to buy properties in london or the current owners reticent with the idea to sell ” , he added .
the real estate of prestige – 5 to 10 % of the highest prices of the market of the real estate – in the prosperous sector located at the south-west of london which is stretched of fulham to wimbledon , increased by a record percentage by 11.8 % during last year .
the prices in the center of london display a regular year growth by year of 5.6 % but were eclipsed by a “ interior market ” in full growth , the south-west of the city , north ( 7.4 % ) and is ( 6.5 % ) knowing a recovery , according to the studies of savills .
the shutdown in the usa slowed down the rise of the automobile market

the three large manufacturers of strait display a growth with two digits compared to october 2012 but only general motors did better than expected .

in a note with the customers of the bank , it estimates that this light brake application is explained initially by “ the governmental &apos; shutdown &apos; and its impact on the feeling of the consumer during first about fifteen the month ” .
gm nevertheless mentioned a progression of almost 16 % of its sales last month with 226,402 vehicles , against 211,563 expected by the consensus .
the four brands of the group saw their commercial performances improving compared to october 2012 .

a study intended to multiply the advantages of railway project hs2 for scotland was launched by the british government .
the work completed by hs2 ltd lets think that the services at high speed until scotland and the north of england will start as of the phase cut-off 1 in 2026 .
the minister for transport baroness kramer declared that the project “ would gather the united kingdom ” .
the scottish minister for transport , keith brown said himself “ excited ” to the idea to work with the british government on the project .
phase 1 will relate to a railway new line at high speed between london and west midlands .
when phase 2 is completed , the lines will serve manchester and leeds .
in june , the government re-examined upwards the estimated cost of the construction of the connection at high speed between london and the north of england , passing from 32.7 md £ with 42.6 md £ .
the british government , which is in talks with scotland transport , asked hs2 ltd to study the reinforcement of the railway capacity and the improvement of the journey time for the north of england and scotland .
that must include the possibility of durations of travel between glasgow and three hour old edinburgh at the maximum .
the baroness kramer declared : “ our objective for hs2 relates to a truly national network which will bring closer the united kingdom and its cities . ”
we push project hs2 because the advantages which he has are enormous .
without him , we are confronted with a problem of capacity of our railway network .
but it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 british big cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , so that the connections between them are better thanks to hs2 .
the british secretary of state for scotland , alistair carmichael , added : “ the announcement of today is a good news for scotland . ”
for the scottish government , keith brown invited mr. carmichael to support “ unambiguous ” the inclusion of scotland in network hs2 .
mr. brown declared : “ the train at high speed has the potential to offer considerable economic advantages to scotland , but it also brings the economic weight of scotland in the global project of railway network at high speed in all great britain .
“ we are thus excited with the idea to work in partnership with the british government in order to examine the options aiming at bringing the network of train at high speed as far as scotland , creating an advantage for all and supplementing the glasgow-edinburgh line which the scottish government is already planning .
“ i am impatient of reading the report of examination with the british ministers the next year and we will then decide together forthcoming stages . ”
uno greets the new objectives in favour of the fight against poverty
the united nations will be put as of now working on a new series of objectives intended to replace the objectives of the millenium for development ( omd ) , which had been set up 12 years ago to fight against poverty in the world .
the australian diplomats played a key function in the durable setting in front of the “ development objectives ” intended to replace the omd , which will expire in 2015 , before the summit of the united nations on the sustainable development which began the day before in rio de janeiro .
they appeared in the final preliminary draft of the document , which will be adopted by the world leaders , including mrs. gillard , during the top .
the general secretary of uno ban ki-moon said the day before the top that it was now time “ to exceed the national interests ” .
“ i am happy that the member states agreed to launch and to adapt the process aiming at setting universal development objectives durable ( odd ) ” , he added .
ces odd will be based on the progress made within the framework as of objectives of the millenium for the development and will form integral part of the framework of development post-2015 .
i will do the utmost to discharge mandate which was entrusted to me by the member states to carry out our durable vision of the development objectives which are based on the success of the omd .
the parents of intersexués children can choose “ unspecified sex ”
germany became the first european nation to recognize a third sex for the infants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
the male sex or female of new born will be allotted to them more , in a rigid way , with the birth .
within the framework of the new law , the parents will not be held any more to declare the sex of their child , authorizing them to register an “ unspecified ” sex or “ not specified ” on its certificate of birth .
the goal of the law was to remove the pressure which weighed on the shoulders of the parents who could make decisions precipitated concerning a surgery of sexual reassignment for their infant , and to fight against discrimination in the opposition as of intersexuées people .
according to the bbc , a intersexuée person would have said years later , “ i am neither a man nor a woman . ”
i will remain the patchwork which the doctors created , contused and slashed .
it is estimated that a child on 2 000 born each year , is neither a boy nor a girl .
they are intersexués , intersexuality belonging to the group of about sixty diseases diagnosed like disorders the sexual development , a generic term nominating the persons having of the chromosomes or the gonads ( ovaries or testicles ) atypical or of the abnormally developed sexual organs .
wallis simpson could have been intersexuée .
the sexual identification still is not well understood , but most specialists in the united states say that when the sex cannot be given , it is better to use best information available to allot it , then to expect and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act , if necessary .
dr. jack drescher , psychiatrist in new york and specialist in the questions of sexual identification , declared that the new german law “ seems to be a good idea ” .
the intersexués children pose an ethical dilemma .
“ certain people suffer from extremely serious diseases which require a surgical act , but it is not the case of the majority of the children ” , he added .
it is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation , and to see how the identity develops .
the science which consists in knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
nobody can answer the question of knowing why that occurs .
it is as the mystery which surrounds the homosexual people .
report subjected to european commission in 2011 described people intersexuées like different from people transsexuals or transgenres , since their statute is not related to the sex but rather with their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman , but is in general two at the same time and not the clearly defined one as being one or the other .
these characteristics can appear themselves in the secondary sexual characters , ( as the muscular mass , pilosity , the chest and the stature ) , the sexual characters primary education ( like the reproductive bodies and the sexual organs ) or the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones .
the report also gave an outline of discrimination with which were confronted the intersexuées people and transgenres as regards employment , as well as the extent of the acts of harassing and violence and of the crimes moved by prejudices .
the young boys of kind not-in conformity have from now on camps which are especially intended to them .
australia and nepal authorize already the adults to register male sex , female or “ third sex ” on their official documents .
in june , australian 52 years , norrie may-welby , became the first nobody in the “ neutral ” world to be recognized after having gained its appeal which authorizes it to keep a sex “ not specified ” with life .
the german passports will comprise the third designation beside m or f – x for intersexué , according to the ministry for the interior .
in close france , the questions of kind always are the object of controversies , according to a report diffused on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozen legislators of this fundamentally catholic country signed a petition so that the “ theory of the kinds ” is withdrawn from the schoolbooks .
the american site catholic online was also opposed to the german law , writing that “ since the world is trailed in a new reign where the kind is a choice but where the sexual activity is not one , one reverses two other pillars of the civilisation . ”
in maryland , the mother of an infant also declared on baby zones that she would prefer that a sex is allotted to the babies with their birth .
“ the role of relative is sufficiently stressing without additional restrictions , in particular if you do not know the sex of your child ” , she declared on the site intended for the young parents .
the children need stability and certainty .
historically , the newborns without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites , according to the name of the splendid greek god who had a double sex .
and hardly about ten years ago , the medical community regarded the kind as a slate , which one can delete and on which one can redraw .
but from now on , many which is those call into question the ethical base of the surgery , knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can be mistaken , not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when it grows .
“ in the middle of 20th century , one called that a psychiatric urgency ” , drescher indicated .
when these children were born , one did not call the psychiatrist , one telephoned the surgeon .
the dominant theory on the way of treating the children equipped with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by dr. john money , of the johns-hopkins university , which considered that the kind is malleable .
it devoted the term “ identity sexual ” and supported that the social and environmental signals – the way in which the parents raise a child – interact with genes and the hormones of a child to work it so that it is identified as being of male sex or female .
but in a case of 1966 , known under the name of “ john / joan ” , his theories caused controversies .
he had advised with the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut at the time of a circumcision skimped on to make it entirely castrate , by also removing the testicles to him , and to raise it like a girl .
“ money presented that like a successful case of transition , but it was not the case ” , drescher declared .
at the age of approximately 15 years , it is become again a boy and married with a woman .
but at 38 years , it committed suicide .
drescher declared that certain doctors “ always repeat this model ” .
but in the years 1990 , with the arrival of internet , those which survived these operations of change of sex say “ &#91; that &#93; they are not satisfied with the result ” .
such is the case of jim bruce , a 36 year old writer of montana , which was born with male chromosomes xy but from the ambiguous sexual organs .
the doctors could not really say if it had a broad clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that it could not never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
thus little time after its birth in 1976 , bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external body and testicles and was high like a girl .
one made him take female hormones at the 12 years age .
“ i knew that i was not a girl ” , he declared on abcnews.com .
i was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 years , it underwent a vaginoplastie .
but depressed and realizing that something did not go , he asked his medical record .
what he discovered it horrified .
i was sterilized with the birth – and nobody had never told me .
bruce was born with a disorder from the sexual development ( dds ) which prevented its body from producing sufficient testosterone so that its sexual organs can develop .
after having learned the truth , it is become again a man , while following a treatment to testosterone and was made remove the centres .
the surgery made it sterile .
today , it defends the cause of the others in an organization called project interface , which tries to standardize the perception of the intersexuées people .
but anne tamar-mattis , chief executive officer of the non-profit organization based in california advocates for informed choice , fears that the german law “ invites to labelling and stigmatization ” .
“ many activists worry that the german law encourages the parents to make fast decisions and give to their child “ an unspecified ” sex ” , she declared .
we are afraid which she encourages the interventions .
we think that it would be to better allot a male sex or female , and to wait .
but we did not see what the law was going to give , therefore we can only advance assumptions .
tamar-mattis declared that its organization supported the australian law because “ it authorizes the adults to be chosen to be recognized under name third sex ” .
“ the adults should be able to make up their own minds in connection with a legal kind ” , she added .
the german law relates to the attribution of the sex to the birth .
it is not a battle which the young children should lead to this age .
when they grow , they will be able to make decisions concerning their own body .
but dr. arlene baratz , radiologist specialized in the mammographies with pittsburgh , whose girl is reached of a disorder of the sexual development and who helps of the thousands of people in a group of support , declared that the german law “ will give a sense of responsibility ” the parents and the children .
the girl of dr. baratz , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but suffers from a dds called syndrome of complete insensitivity to the androgens .
because of the failure of his receivers of androgens , katie developed female characteristics .
it has a vagina , but not uterus nor of ovaries .
today 29 years old , katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
although it is sterile , it hopes to have children through services of adoption or surrogate mothers .
“ the law leaves a certain latitude to the parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions ” , baratz declared .
that leaves them time to make certain tests and to understand them , and a time before registering “ male ” or “ female ” .
thus , all is well – you can raise your child and like it .
you have a splendid baby and benefit from the pleasure of being relative .
you do not have to precipitate you for a surgical operation which is irreversible .
“ that puts the children in the middle of the decision and attenuates the feeling of anxiety which motivates the parents because they are afraid not to do what it is necessary ” , she declared .
lastly , the child will decide with which sex il / elle le / la at ease feels more – and it is something of formidable .
that authorizes the child to make the decision for itself .

the cry of despair of a voter of obama
i voted twice for president obama , believing in the possibility of a change
he says that obama made creditable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the republican party
obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the obamacare site , nor the attacks of drones
the report of marketing year 2008 of obama is a sad recall what could have done without
nathaniel p. morris is student in 2nd year of medicine at the medical college of harvard .
i am reading a terribly sad book these days .
it is a book which , i thought , would encourage to me during the moroseness of the 2nd year of medicine and hope would give again me .
it is called “ the audacity to windows ” and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of barack obama of 2008 .
when i finished the medical reports of my patients the evening and that i lie down , this book takes back me at the time where the policies inspired by the million people and where the speeches could cut you the breath .
the election ended in a crushing victory and the presenters of the newspapers of news took the time to think of the historical nature of the moment .
my comrades cried of joy and my parents preserved all the newspapers which they found .
a young team of visionaries advanced towards the white house and the nation was ready for the change .
during the period of transition of obama before her taking of in 2008 , it had 82 % of favorable opinions .
and then i close the book .
the return to the present is a difficult alarm clock , it is like leaving one dreamed .
it is difficult to remember these days full with optimism , it are like remote memories , a sad recall of the appropriatenesses of the past .
the change really occurred in the years which followed the first time where i voted .
that had nothing to do with what i had imagined .
i put at the credit of obama of great achievements , since the passage of affordable care act ( law on the accessible care ) until the departure of iraq of our army , via the end of “ neither seen nor known ” and the assassination of oussama ben laden .
moreover , i believe that obstructionism in favour destroyed too many efforts aiming at advancing our nation in the field of the reforms of immigration , the public health care and the closing of guantanamo , inter alia things .
but after defendhaving many times defended the administration of obama vis-a-vis my pars and my colleagues , i do not manage any more to provide explanations .
i am at the edge of political despair .
the republican obstruction cannot explain the setting on listening of the foreign leaders , nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones .
it cannot explain why the national security agency collects data on the private life of the americans , nor the committal for trial of the denouncers who reveal the misdeeds of the government .
it cannot justify the assassination of anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , without lawsuit , nor the escape from public finances and the going beyond the expenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns .
it cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the white house to reduce the media to silence are “ the more aggressive … since the administration of nixon ” .
and , more recently , it cannot excuse impossibility of conceiving a simple website during more than three years after the law on affordable care act was ratified .
i do not know if it is it what i expected .
if , at 18 years , i were supposed to understand that the governance could contradict the political campaigns which precede it .
obviously , the electoral function is not foreseeable , because the political party of opposition and the events which occur by chance , as the massacre of newton , influence our public conversation .
however , all the examples which i indexed above seem to be mainly the choice of the administration .
it is what disturbs me more .
i again voted for obama in 2012 , but not because i was filled with enthusiasm by his candidature .
mitt romney presented a confused and little refined alternative which did not seem to make it possible to determine its policies or its positions .
i felt that obama , elected for a second mandate while being released of the pressure of future elections , would keep the promises about which one intended to speak since so a long time .
however , whereas the index of favorable opinions plunged under 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return at the year 2008 through this book .
it makes me wish the many promises which flew away .
this week , i read the part of the book which describes how obama underwent enormous losses with the profit of clinton to the primary educations of pennsylvania .
at a meeting of after-countryside , he said to his team that it was necessary that they go back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause .
“ i want that we centre ourselves on our talent ” , he declared .
we must remember who we are .
us here 5 years afterwards , mr. president , and i am not any more agreement with you .
the points of view expressed in this comment are only those of nathaniel morris .
the nouvelle star made a success of a return in strength , side audiences , with 1.3 million televiewers behind their station of tv , that is to say 5.6 % of share of audience .
but was the show with go ?
some 10,000 candidates presented themselves to hearings of this 10th season , to face the jury : maurane , malicious sinclair , perched andré manoukian and olivier bas .
on twitter , the televiewers shared their comments .
passed the excitation to find their favorite program , much were disappointed .
but why so much of disappointment ?
no candidate really seems to have marked at the time of this first bonus .
like each year , the first emissions of hearing brew a wide selection of the grass singers , for best and sometimes for worst .
however , on twitter , one wants of the show , the emotion , the originality , the music …
fortunately , some found their account there .
they are numerous to have tried the nouvelle star , and sometimes even with being gone until the end .
behind the tv screens , the vocations of singer with success are always there , season after season .
others have just the ambition to make laugh .
rbs suspend two traders on the foreign exchange market
royal bank of scotland suspended two traders of its division foreign exchange market according to two sources close to the file , which shows once again that the world investigation of the regulators into suspicions of handling of the foreign exchange market starts to bear fruit .
some of the more large banks in the world , in particular ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they cooperated with the regulators within the framework as of investigations conducted into the most important financial market to the world , where 5.3 billions of us dollars change hand each day .
both traders are the first employees of rbs to being suspended within the framework of the widening of the investigation which echoes the scandal of handling of interbank rate libor .
the bank , which refused to comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month to have received information requests on behalf of the regulators .
“ the investigation in progress into this business continues and we cooperate fully with the fca and the other regulators ” , a representative of the bank declared two weeks ago .
last month , of the sources close to the file declared that rbs had transmitted files of e-mails and instantaneous messages , sent to and by old a trader , with the british regulator , financial conduct authority .
this trader , richard usher , left rbs in 2010 and would have been put suspended of its station of european person in charge of the trading at the cash for the currencies at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , person in charge european of the trading of exchange the cash at isic , was put on leave this week , while matt gardiner , trader senior of currencies at barclays and ubs , were suspended by standard chartered this week .
none of these traders was the object of any charge .
the file of mr. usher understood instantaneous messages sent to and by bankers working at barclays and citigroup , sources close to the file added .
ubs explained this week that she had brought an action against some of her employees after the swiss regulator , finma , declared that he inquired into suspicions of handling of the foreign exchange market in a certain number of swiss banks .
in the world , at least six authorities – european commission , finma , authority of swiss competition weko , the fca , the american department of justice and monetary authority of hong kong – examine the allegations made concerning bankers who would have intended themselves to handle the rates on the foreign exchange market .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also launched internal surveys or receipt of the information requests of the regulators , indicated sources close to the file .
the banks peel the instantaneous messages and the e-mails sent since of the years to find cases of acts reprehensible .
the news concerning these investigations shook the traders in a sector which was one of the largest engines of growth of the units of trading of the investment banks during last years , but which was called into question this year because of the low volatility of the currencies which limits opportunities for the speculators .
certain bankers tried to minimize the business by saying that it is almost impossible to handle the vast strongly liquid foreign exchange market , but the traders seniors explain why that is not necessarily true .
a trader senior declared that in spite of the high volume of the daily currency exchange transactions , the fragmentation of the liquidity between the platforms of management of the exchanges and the increasingly frequent use by the banks of their own internal platforms “ explain why it is possible to start to have an impact on the market with few expenses ” .
the news arrived the very same day where credit suisse announced to have returned a trader working in its office of the negotiated funds london stock exchange this week after it because a loss of 6 m $ at the end of the year last .
the bank quickly informed the competent jurisdictions and cooperated with the regulators .
“ we are convinced that the trader acted only and that the business was controlled ” , indicated a representative of credit suisse .

obama goes into reverse reverse running on her reform of the health care system
under an avalanche of criticisms , president obama reconsidered yesterday his promise without ambiguity and often repeated according to which “ if you are satisfied with your mode of health , you can keep it ” .
after hundreds of thousands of people received opinions of cancellation of their people receiving benefits , the republicans criticized the president during last days by showing it to mislead the american people .
yesterday , barack obama adjusted his promise of origin .
“ the majority of people holding a health insurance which is appropriate to them can keep it ” , he declared at the time of a speech in boston .
speaking about what it calls “ an effervescence in the news ” about the cancellations , president obama incited the americans who received these opinions to seek a new insurance on the market .
most people will be able to obtain modes of health complete and adapted better for the same price , even for even less expensive than envisaged .
“ you will leave winner there ” , he declared .
the administration announced that one should not be astonished if 5 % of the population which contracts themselves their insurance found forced to change mode because their cover does not satisfy the new standards required under the terms of affordable care act .

homage to folk of the coen brothers
“ inside llewyn davis ” of the brothers coen , grand prix of the last cannes film festival , is a nostalgic and funny film on greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music which just started to resound there , before the arrival of bob dylan .
joel and ethan coen , from which the catalogue of films comes to be the object of a retrospective to the french cineclub , had nicked the gold palm in cannes in 1991 for barton fink .
in the absence of being able to engage dylan or the trio peter , paul and mary , joel and ethan coen threw their reserved on rising star of the american cinema , oscar isaac , 33 years , but also on the planetary star pop justin timberlake .
in this stuffed film of humour where the music is a central figure and the songs interpreted live , oscar isaac appears a musician and singer of folk achieved , while timberlake , his / her friend in the film , leaves the pop one for the folk music with a contagious jubilation .
as for carey mulligan , it left the rich attire of daisy mulligan in “ gatsby the splendid one ” for clothing less reluisants , a soft voice when it sings , but the swearword output with the machine-gun when it speaks .
“ inside llewyn davis ” tells over one week the tribulations of a singer of folk who does not manage to bore and is annoyed with the whole ground .
it accepts with move back the replacements with the foot raised in the studios .
without housing , he does the rounds of the settees of his friends who want to still receive it .
an air of documentary
“ its relationship to success is tortured , it is that which interested us : a mixture of bad luck , a guy who is not there at the good moment , which is not careerist but integrates , with a self-destroying behavior ” , declared with the press ethan coen , crowned with his brother joel of several oscars and price in cannes .
if llewyn davis did not exist , the two scenario writers fans of folk music built their history on true personalities of the time like the folk musician dave von ronk .
the idea was to show the moment preceding the advent by greenwich village , this district of new york called to become “ the epicentre of the rise of the folk music which would generate stars international ” like writes it the journalist elijah wald , friend of van ronk .
the film takes on an air of documentary then , label of dusty music invaded of 33t unsold inhabited by an old invaluable secretary , with the musical choices of the studios of the time and with the coffees where the singers occurred .
the magic of the coen brothers still operates by integrating funny of character who crosses the film permanently : a splendid russet-red cat with the cracking glance , companion of fortune of llewyn davis .
questioned on the way in which it composed its character , the actor and singer justin timberlake had recalled “ to have grown in tennessee , to have bathed by the blues and the country ” .
“ my first lessons of music were taught to me by my grandfather who learned how to me to play of the guitar ” , he had added .
for justin timberlake , if work is necessary “ to be regarded as good ” , “ the chance can also launch the career of somebody ” , and “ more and more today ” .
comme llewyn davis who refuses very compromised on his music , the pop star explains that in a career , “ most important is not to let itself wedge by all that can prevent us from expressing us ” .

espionage of the nsa : the united states “ went too much far ” , kerry admits
the united states sometimes went “ too far ” as regards espionage , recognized the secretary of state john kerry , in this first consent of washington in full polemic with europe on the massive collection of data by the national agency of security ( nsa ) .
after ten days of scandal , revelations and denials between the european united states and their allies , it is the first time that an american governmental leader explicitly admits practices discussed in the interception by the nsa of communications and data in europe .
“ in certain cases , i concede it to you , like made the president , some of these actions went too far and we will make sure that does not arrive in the future any more ” , john kerry at the time of a conference in london declared in which he took part from washington thursday , october 31 by video connection .
in his broadcast intervention , in the presence of his british counterpart william hague , the chief of the american diplomacy lengthily justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks .
calling upon the attacks of september 11th , 2001 , the attacks of madrid in march 2004 and those of london in july 2005 , john kerry ensured that the american authorities since had thwarted many projects of attacks , thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information .
“ we have in prevented fact that planes do not fall , that buildings do not explode and that people are assassinated , because we were able to be with the current upstream of these projects ” , the owner of the american diplomacy argued .
and , john kerry intended for europeans , “ i affirmed ensure you that in this process of the innocent people were not misled ” .
but we endeavour to gather information .
“ and yes , in certain cases , it went too much far from inappropriate manner ” , still the secretary of state admitted , which had already had to be described on this international scandal at the time of a round last week in paris , london and rome .
it ensured thursday evening that president obama “ was determined to try to clarify and that it proceeded to a re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels misled ” .
but the controversy between americans and europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press .
according to washington post , the nsa intercepted data of hundreds of million users of google and yahoo .
the newspaper , which quotes documents obtained from the ex-consultant of the nsa edward snowden , affirms that the program baptized “ muscular ” , and carried out with the british counterpart of the nsa , the gchq , makes it possible these two agencies to recover data since optical fibers used by the giants of internet .
with believing one of the documents of them , some 181 million elements had been collected during the only month of last january - energy of metadata on e-mail , with elements of text or audio or video documents .
these interceptions would take place apart from the united states .
but yahoo and google denied any link with these practices .
for ten days , several large newspapers in france , in germany , in spain or italy , have revealed that the nsa would massively have intercepted data and communications emanating of combined of the united states and their leaders , in particular the german chancellor angela merkel .
vis-a-vis the anger of european states and whereas escapes in the american press affirmed that the us president was not with the current of such listenings , barack obama refused to be expressed on this subject , calling upon the national security .
on the other hand , the owner of powerful the nsa , the general keith alexander , contradicted to him that its information agency collected tens of million communications of european citizens .
it even returned the ball to the european intelligence services which would have seized themselves of these communications , before providing them to the nsa .
that would relate to “ military operations ” in countries where these allies of nato cooperate with the united states and that would absolutely not aim europe , affirmed the alexander general .
and the polemic extended friday in asia .
indonesia convened the ambassador of australia , whose mission is shown to be used by the americans within the framework of a vast international spy network which also caused the anger of china .
early puberty : to age earlier
studies show that the young girls afro-americans and hispanic tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than the white young girls .
the physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
nothing proves that the hormones or that other chemical substances are responsible
the experts think that the epidemic of obesity could be a release of early puberty
the trend towards an early puberty is not also marked among boys
the former correspondent of cnn pat etheridge is a specialized journalist in the family questions and of health in the child .
does a mother have to worry if the centres and the pubic hairs of his / her daughter start to push to 7 or 8 years ?
at the time of the annual conference of american academy of pediatrics which was held this week in orlando , in florida , dr. paul kaplowitz , pedo-endocrinologist , explained that these early physical changes are rather current among the american young people and represent a new standard .
“ i spend much time to reassure the parents – in general , that does not indicate a quick change towards full puberty ” , kaplowitz declared .
the obvious signs of development , such as the budding of the centres , the hairs under the arms and in the pubic zone and the body odors , appear earlier in the girls .
but there was only one light advanced of the age of the first rules during four last decades .
in the united states , the median age is of 12 years and half , whereas it was 12 years three quarters in 1970 .
“ once the chest started to develop , one needs at least two or three years before the first rules appear ” , indicated kaplowitz , also the author of “ early puberty in girls : the essential guides to coping with this common problem ” .
time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve .
there is a debate concerning what constitutes the real appearance of puberty , but she is regarded as “ early ” when the development of the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the 8 years age .
in most case , the development slows down or stops – it is something which a pediatrist can follow closely .
a faster evolution can justify tests carried out by a endocrinologist to draw aside from the serious problems like tumours or cysts .
there exist treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : a premature ageing of the bones which can slow down the growth and a small at the adulthood .
the recommendations as regards medicamentous and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .
the psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is careful with the drugs but recognizes that “ the fact of controlling puberty can attenuate certain problems of behavior and the feeling for the young girls to be different from different ” .
the other major problem is comprehensible : the parents do not want quite simply that their very young girls have their rules .
“ they fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they will manage the questions of hygiene ” , kaplowitz declared .
“ that was a shock ” , remembers a woman whose girl had her first rules at 10 years .
even if there were signs and that we had spoken about the rules , it was not prepared emotionally .
it returned from the school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends .
there exist many theories made available of the public on the causes of early puberty .
however , there is no coherent theory according to which the hormones contained in milk or other food , the chemical products present in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible .
the boys , like the girls , reach their puberty earlier .
kaplowitz affirms that the most credible assumption is that of the epidemic of obesity .
it took part in a study conducted on old girls from 6 to 9 years which binds the percentage of fatty mass to the release of puberty .
others discovered support this conclusion , but there exist many other influential factors .
in this country , the young girls afro-americans and hispanic tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than the white young girls .
there exist various explanations .
on a worldwide scale , the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by all , of the economic conditions to the climate , via genes .
another problem : although the boys have hairs on the face and in the pubic zone young people , the trend towards a true early puberty is not as marked as in the girls .
other doctors taking part in the conference of the aap insisted on the complexity of the subject .
the appearance of the acne and the pubic hairs is current , even in the infants and the toddlers .
“ we must be careful as for the way in which we identify the true appearance of puberty ” , said dr. lawrence silverman , a pedo-endocrinologist working at the hospital for goryeb children in morristown , in the new jersey .
the parents should not hesitate to request council from their pediatrist to know how to speak with their child .
“ that can mean to have a conversation earlier than envisaged ” , explained kaplowitz .
if you remain calm , your child will react well in general .
the girls whose puberty is early must be reassured on the fact that , even when that arrives earlier than provided , the process is part of the life .

he tells me “ one is released ” , but i am not sure , and tell me that one can still be killed .
one very excited , but is very tended too .

the descent of the staircase of the plane , the meeting again with my son and my parents , my friends , all that is extremely strong in emotion .
between the airport and at home , of many motorcycles follow our car that led roussin .
the motorcyclists draw flock to make photographs and follow me until at home where i must make a little the police to prevent some from going up .
the media pressure is enormous .
that does not stop , we are well placed for the knowledge …
but the state of emotion and tiredness is such as it is difficult to see there clearly .
one leaves a hole and one is suddenly under media fires .
it is complicated a little , a little violent one , rather complex to manage .
but one made hardest .
the evening-even , i am at the 20 : 00 , the following day also i am on tv .
begin then a kind of readjustment with the life , very gently , for one or two months which is a little like vacancies .
how did the medical examinations and debriefing dgse occur ?
i had been entitled to the first medical control in corsica .
the rest was made with the valley-of-grace the following days my return : radios , examinations in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist .
it is not a meeting which does all but one can that one can count on him , recall it if need be , that one is not delivered to ourselves .
that been part of the procedure .
i also met the intelligence services .
they put to me questions about the takers of hostages .
it was logical .
that did not obstruct me .
how do you react , today , with the release of the four hostages of niger ?
i listen what is said .
the debate on the ransoms in particular .
certain things irritate me , others less .
i try to make allowances between the questions about my past as an hostage and a my cap of president of association “ hostages of the world ” which enables me to put distance , and seems much more interesting to me to approach .
i wonder for example about the definition of impact strength .
especially , i fight , with others , for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage .
there is in my opinion a problem of semantics .
it is necessary to qualify the taking of hostages of “ political ” taking of hostages - what is the case most of the time - and to make it possible to the hostages to have access to justice , to carry felt sorry for and to bring their takers of hostages before the international criminal court .
today , once more , everyone is in the compassion , the emotion , and is delighted by the release of these hostages .
but which says that these hostages could perhaps have also access to justice ?
a court in the hague east made for that .
why wouldn &apos;t one say to the takers of hostages “ you ridiculed the rules of the war , like those of all geneva conventions , one will bring you in justice ” ?
that however seems to me founded , legitimates , struck good sense .
this message is heard , but is not listened , and that shocks me .
it is my principal combat .

in seyne , rehousing due to rats turns to the polemic
at the beginning of week , a family left her apartment in ground floor of the building fructidor d2 , because of the presence of rats .
in front of the urgency of the situation , the director of the office grounds of the southern habitat , proposed , in an exceptional and provisional way , to rehouse the couple and his three children in new t4 .
however , the family refuses “ for financial reason ” and the situation is blocked .
the business took exaggerated proportions , estimates joël canapa , the director of the office .
rats , there always was in the cities .
the company of rat extermination carries out two passages a year , and moreover , we intervene , with our load , each request of the inhabitants .
we thus carried out , since the end of last winter , 64 interventions .
the district is not left with the abandonment , and the rats do not pullulate in the city .
for reasons of environmental protection and public health , the products of rat extermination are four times less effective than in the past , certainly , but for two rats , one will not kill a kid .
“ we did not invite the rats on our premises ” , defends the father who left his housing to settle with the hotel .
we are soon without the penny and we expect a new housing , with the same rate as the old one .
royal bank of scotland will create in-house a structure of defeasance ( “ bad bank ” ) gathering 38 billion books ( 45 billion euros ) the most risked credits , intended measures to slacken its relations with london and to accelerate its reprivatisation .
the bank wants to reduce by 55 % to 70 % the proportion of the doubtful credits in its assessment in the two years to come and hopes to have completely cleaned this one in the three years .
rbs also said that it would register a provision for depreciation of the doubtful debts additional from four to 4.5 billion books over the quarter , a writing related to the constitution of the structure of quartering .
rbs also specified that this internal reorganization would release from 10 to 11 billion books of capital , thus reinforcing its capacity to be lent .
the bank and london stressed that the “ bad bank ” would make it possible to draw a feature on the past , the government having been in particular shown to interfere into the management of rbs .
“ we can now go from front , to worry us future and of the 90 % of the credits which constitute a really good bank and to build a large bank for the customers and the united kingdom ” , the new chief executive officer ross mcewan said to the press .
george kerevan : the bursting of europe gives the choice to the scot
another day , another worrying history of independence .
this time , us are warned that independent scotland would be held to join the european zone of freedom of movement to be able to adhere to the eu .
and here that one hears stories of passport control in berwick and a border of barbed sons along the hadrian &apos;s wall .
if it is true that the newspaper of strathclyde indicated the possible economic consequences of a greater freedom of movement with the rest of europe , that however did not appear in the headlines ( and it was to be envisaged ) .
nobody either said that the member states of the eu devote most of their time to circumvent their formal rules when that arranges them .
since scotland is not part of schengen space for the moment , a continuous non-observance of the rules would be a mean concession that brussels could offer whole on the other hand that she wants to obtain from the scot .
it is thus about a history which is not one .
and a history so old that it is now fixed : i heard for the first time the tall story according to which “ independence means the passport control ” there is more than 40 years .
however , one forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale .
why independent scotland should follow the instructions of europe , in fact ?
why exchange the yoke of london against that of brussels , in particular now ?
here true news concerning europe : the great plan of post-war period aiming at unifying europe is definitively at the dead point .
with the crisis of the euro , the europe project officially died .
through europe , the parties which oppose to the eu or which militate for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency , gain ground .
even in germany , the party eurosceptic alternative for germany , only founded this year and arrived of nowhere , gathered almost five million voice at the time as of federal elections of september and left the democratic liberal party ( equivalent of our liberal-democrats ) the bundestag .
there always was a national opposition to the creation project of federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis marked a turning .
the austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , associated with the heavy yoke on the national economies via adhesion with the single currency , led many people to think that the europe project went too far .
the crisis of the euro does not have large-thing to see with the national governments which record excessive budget deficits – that was only true for greece .
the european system rather made weigh on its members of exchange rates favorable to the german exporters – what the german politicians want to preserve .
without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the countries of europe of the south are found with an intrinsic problem of productivity with respect to germany .
the only recourse is to make dark cuts in the wages and the public expenditure – encouraged by berlin .
beyond the budgetary and monetary problems current , there exists a major discomfort related to the productivity in europe .
following the “ green ” energy policies imposed by brussels – which are a reason to subsidize the french companies and german of the energy sector to the expenses of the consumer – european industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas that the united states .
it is about a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs , as we already saw in grangemouth .
all the gel of wages in the world will not prevent european petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap american schist gas .
consequently , the revolt thunders , in particular in france , one of the large leaders of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite regarded the eu as a means of controlling germany and of putting paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin does not need more paris like passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in europe , leaving the french economy put at evil to thrash about .
result : the party of far right of marine le pen , front national anti-european , has just gained a crucial by-election , returning the socialists with the power in the third place .
front national is from now on the most popular party in france with 24 % of the votes – a convenient warning for the british workers party which reminds to him that it cannot leave the principle which a scission of the right-hand side will support automatically the left .
what makes marine le pen with her new popularity near the french white working class ?
she wants to make use of the european elections of the next year to create a single block anti-currency and anti-european within the european parliament .
if the parties anti-europeans make good figure with these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the european parliament for the first time .
here what i think : very soon , the feeling anti-european and single anti-currency in europe will unify and will end up killing the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will return to something which will resemble more “ europe of the nations ( sovereign ) ” free privileged by the general de gaulle .
germany and some of its satellite economies could preserve the euro , but france and europe of the south will find their own currency .
i expect that the united kingdom keeps its distance compared to this project , and i hope that it will make the soft eyes in the united states .
however , the interest growing of washington for the pacific lets think that great britain will be rejected in the atlantic .
and scotland , in all that ?
we can decide to be an area of small england ( primarily ) .
or we can defend our economic own interests , which includes to send packing berlin and brussels .
i believe that scotland could put up with a freer european agreement provided that we keep our own currency .
the co-operation with the other countries with the similar sights would be easier in nonfederal europe of the nations .
if not , we should imitate norway and preserve our economic independence .
the government snp of scotland east – and it is to be noted – the political movement anti-austerity which best succeeded in europe , since it gained a spectacular majority in 2011 founded over its opposition to the cuts dark suggested ( and put in work ) by the labour chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , and the coalition conservatives / liberal-democrats who followed .
it would be ridiculous maintaining for scotland to vote for independence if is to accept the austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .
a house the prey of the flames in the old québec
a fire which started midday friday in the old québec was quickly controlled .
more than thirty firemen were dispatched to the 9 of the street hébert .
the flames were declared in a house of three residences distributed out of four stages located behind the court of the seminar of quebec .
all the tenants were absent at the time of the fire .
fire was controlled one hour after the arrival of the firemen , who were numerous to intervene .
at once that our first firemen arrived , they really saw apparent smoke .

an investigation is in hand to find the cause of this fire .
spectacular jump in “ wingsuit ” above bogota
the sportsman jhonathan florez jumped thursday of a helicopter above bogota , the colombian capital .

end of service for the chef of the elysium
entered 500 m2 of the elysian kitchens as clerk after having worked in embassies , the cook climbed all the levels until becoming chief , nine years ago .
it served six french presidents , of georges pompidou with françois hollande via nicolas sarkozy , including on their holiday places , and nourished an incalculable number the large ones of this world in an quasi-anonymity which it breaks only today , at the time of the retirement , at 60 years .
the man with the opened face , skull dismantled and glasses of intellectual , born on october 24th , 1953 in ferté-saint-aubin is titular of a cape of pastry making .
his / her mother was itself cooker in a castle of the sologne .
“ i passed from a castle the other ! ” , is ironical bernard vaussion , who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for which it officiated , but also of their wives and some their famous guests .
“ it is always the head of the state or its partner or marries which chooses the menus ” , he recalls .
“ mrs. chirac was implied a little , it came directly cooks some ” , so much so that it had prohibited the women in the kitchens of the elysium !
with due respect to heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods , “ they all are greedy ” , denounces bernard vaussion nicely .
jacques chirac had certainly “ an appetite a little more developed ” .
but with nicolas sarkozy , who had removed cheese , the plates returned empty !
as for françois hollande , who restored cheese , “ it is somebody who likes to eat ” and “ there is not large-thing that it does not like ” .
the current head of the state , which regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign , does not have “ not a request for specific regime ” .
bernard vaussion also remembers the pressure which weighed on its shoulders , in particular at the time as of dinners of state to the elysium : it is necessary to be useful “ between 200 and 250 people in approximately one hour ” .
the night who precedes is almost white .
these people-there would not understand that there are errors .
from now on the former chief of the kitchens of the elysium , which took glass tuesday evening with its team , her family and of the friends , leaves with a pinching in the middle ” . françois hollande came to greet me ” .
he said praises .
“ its human side is brought out ” , he tells .
the chief will be replaced by his assistant , guillaume gomez , 35 years , which has been for its part for seventeen years in the elysium .

the investigation into the mayor rob ford was skimped on , supports a lawyer
after the police had confirmed to have put the hand on a copy of the video which would show smoking rob ford of the ace , me clayton ruby supported never not to have seen “ such a skimped on ” investigation .
me ruby said to believe with the canadian press that the police “ had been unaware of or minimized ” the pieces of evidence against the mayor .
this thursday , the police stopped the friend and occasional of rob ford , alexander lisi , driver 35 years old , and showed it of extortion compared to the video .
alexander lisi , previously shown of drug trafficking , was in frequent liaison with the mayor .
the police said to have also observed this delivering man of the parcels with rob ford , indicate new documents of court .
me ruby qualified “ unexplainable ” fact that the police never excavated the vehicle of rob ford or its residence , or put on listening its telephone , supporting that the chief of police bill blair chose with full knowledge of the facts not to act against the mayor .
under the terms of the law , the police , having been pilot suspect transactions in clean hands , could very well have intercepted the vehicle of rob ford , have stopped the mayor , and have carried out a search - even without mandate .
it could also have required an instantaneous search warrant , if considered to be necessary .
the chief of police did not comment on , but its spokesperson mark pugash qualified the remarks of me ruby of “ attempt obvious and despaired ” to put forward itself near the media in a business which does not relate to it at all .
in press conference , thursday , mr. blair affirmed that there was nothing in this video which can constitute “ reasonable reasons ” being able to lead to the deposit of a criminal charge against the mayor .

explosion of a house with gesves : a defective water-heater at the origin of the explosion
the grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak .
the explosion of a dwelling with gesves , which made two seriously injureds friday morning , a 52 year old grandmother and her 5 year old grandson , is due to a gas leak coming from a defective water-heater , indicated friday evening the substitute of the prosecutor of the king .
the expert dispatched on the spot by the parquet floor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental .
the grandmother lit a cigarette whereas there were an escape and an accumulation of gas .
the vital prognosis of the two victims is always committed .
the grandmother was projected by the explosion and is seriously burned .
the little boy , who remained in his grandfather and his partner , was at his sides and was flaring more slightly .
“ the two victims were intubated and lengthily conditioned on the spot before being taken along to chu de liège , it in the helicopter , him in the ambulance ” , the burgomaster josé paulet specified , went down on the spot .
traumatized , the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
healthy and except , there could join the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed .
the grandfather and the tenant of the close house , weakened by the explosion , were rehoused by the president of the cpas .
the firemen of andenne and namur and the police of the arches intervened .
the civil protection of crisnée stabilized the two buildings .
a black box in your car ?
whereas the planners of the road network of the united states have difficulty finding the money necessary to repair the motorway infrastructure in decrepitude , many which is those foresee a solution in the form of a small black box which is fixed above instrument panel of your car .
the devices , which record all the miles traversed by a motorist and transmit information to the civils servant , are in the center of an attempt discussed in washington and in the governmental offices of planning to alter the obsolete system of financing of the american main roads .
the sector generally without interest of the planning of the main roads suddenly caused a debate extremely animated and animated alliances .
the libertarians joined groups ecologists to put pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep the trace of the miles which you traverse , and possibly road on which you circulate , then to use information to write a tax government bill .
tea party is dismayed .
civil american liberties union also is very worried and expresses its concern concerning protection of privacy .
and while the members of the congress are not able to agree to know if it is necessary to continue , several states did not wait .
they seek how , during the next decade , they will be able to pass to a system making it possible the drivers to pay according to the number of traversed miles .
thousands of motorists already embarked these black boxes , sometimes equipped with a monitoring system by gps , for one transferred experimental .
that is really essential for our nation .
“ it is not as if we had the choice ” , declared hassan ikhrata , chief executive officer of southern california association of governments , which provides that the state starts to record the miles traversed by each californian motorist by 2025 .
there will be change in the way in which we pay these taxes .
technology is there to do it .
the pressure comes owing to the fact that the highway fund trust of the country , financed with the taxes which the americans pay with the pump , is financially dry .
the americans buy as much of petrol only front .
the cars can traverse more miles with one gallon .
the federal tax itself , which is of 18.4 hundreds per gallon , has not increased for 20 years .
the politicians are reticent to increase the tax , even of 1 hundred , whereas the prices of the petrol are high .
“ the tax on the petrol is quite simply not bearable ” , declared lee munich , a specialist in the policies of transport at the university of minnesota .
its state recently made install tracers on 500 cars to test a system of payment with the mile .
“ that proves to be the most logical alternative in the long run ” , he said .
wonks calls that of the expenses of use to mileage .
it is not surprising that the idea allures the town liberals , since the taxes could be used to modify the practices of control so as to make it possible to reduce the obstructions and the gas emissions , for example .
the planners of california are interested in the system since they work out strategies to reach the objectives set in the ambitious laws of the state on climate warming .
but the representative bill shuster ( r-pa . ) , president of the committee of transport of the house of representatives , declared that he also regarded it as the most viable alternative in the long run .
the partisans of the open market of the reason foundation also appreciate the idea to make pay the drivers with the mile .
“ it is not simply about a tax engulfing itself in a large black hole ” , adrian moore , vice-president of the policy to the reason foundation declared .
people pay more directly for the advantages which are gotten to them .
the movement is also supported by two former american secretaries with transport which , in a ratio of 2011 , exhorted the congress with going in the way of the payment to the mile .
the american senate approved a pilot project of 90 m $ last year which would have related to approximately 10 000 cars .
but the presidency of the room killed the proposal , answering the concerns of the rural legislators representing of the voters who must traverse many miles the every day to go to their work or downtown .
several states and big cities make nevertheless progress on their side .
given is oregon , which mobilized 5 000 drivers to undertake the most important experiment of the country .
these motorists will pay soon in the state of the kilometric expenses instead of the taxation of the petrol .
nevada already carried out a pilot project in the long term .
the town of new york considers one of them .
illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which understands 17 agencies implied in road transport in states skirting on the east side american ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) studies how it could implement the change .
the concept is not a universal success .
in nevada , where approximately 50 voluntary motorists recently equipped their car with a device , the drivers were anxious that the government can follow their the least action .
“ concerns about big brother and this kind of things are a big problem ” , alauddin khan declared , which directs the strategic management of the performance to the department of transport of nevada .
it is not something which people want .
at the beginning of the test , the aclu of nevada informed on its site : “ it would be relatively easy to transform these devices into devices of localization except for whole . ”
it is not necessary to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure which will be inevitably widened to preserve the recordings of the daily comings and goings of people .
nevada is part of some states which thrash about from now on to find a technology accessible which would make it possible at the state to know how much miles traverses a car , but without knowing the place nor the hour exact .
if one can do that , added khan , the citizens will be more at ease .
the search for this technology led certain agencies of state to call on small a start-up of california of the name of true mileage .
at the origin , the company was not intended to help the motorists who pay taxes in the states .
she sought to bore in the emerging market of the car insurance , in which the drivers would pay according to their mileage .
but which it tests the planners of the main roads liked the devices because they do not use gps and provide a limited quantity of information , downloaded periodically by modem .
“ people will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not locate them ” , ryan morrison , chief executive officer of true mileage declared .
large mistakes were made in the pilot programs of certain states .
there exist average much cheaper and methods much intrusive to proceed .
in oregon , the planners try the experiment by offering to the motorists various choices .
they can choose a device with or without gps .
they can still choose not to have a device of the whole , preferring in the place to pay a fixed price based on the median number of miles traversed by all the residents of the state .
other states hope to sell the concept to citizens being wary while allowing the devices to make some more , rather than not enough .
in the town of new york , the persons in charge of transport seek to develop a device of taxation which would be also equipped to pay the expenses of parking , to provide an insurance “ payment to control ” and to create a set of data on speed in real time coming from the other drivers that the motorists could use to avoid the congestions .
“ the motorists would be incited to take part because as of advantages that the system their offer ” , a document indicated on the urban development .
however , certain planners of transport wonder whether all the debate on the payment with the mile is not simply an enormous diversion .
to metropolitan transportation commission of the zone of bay of san francisco , the persons in charge say that the congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the highway fund trust by increasing the taxation of the petrol .
single or renewal fees additional could be imposed on the drivers of hybrid vehicles and others of which the vehicles do not consume much petrol , so that each one pays its right share .
“ it is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when one quite simply needs aspirine ” , declared randy rentschler , the director of the legislation and the public affairs attached to the commission .
if that is done , about the hundreds of million motorists will worry about the protection of their private life and a lot of other things .
the british police delivers a mandate of extradition against assange
the british police today delivered a mandate of extradition against the founder of wikileaks julian assange , which took refuge with the embassy from ecuador in london and required the political asylum .
scotland yard declared that it had delivered a “ opinion of handing-over ” against australian the 40 years , requiring of him to present itself to a police station , adding that if it did not do it , it would be likely to be stopped .
assange could be extradited in sweden following the allegations of sexual crime , after having exhausted all the possible ways under the terms of the british law after the supreme court invalidated the call which it lodged against its extradition at the beginning of the month .
fearing that stockholm authorizes its transfer towards the united states , it found refuge with the embassy from ecuador in london on june 19th , asking this country of south america the political asylum .
scotland yard “ delivered an opinion of handing-over against man a 40 year old who asks him to be presented to a police station , the date and hour of his choice ” , a spokesperson declared .
it continues to infringe the conditions of its setting in release on bail .
the embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the opinion by the police .
assange fears to be extradited of sweden towards the united states where it could be marked of espionage , after having revealed more than 250 000 american diplomatic cables on the wikileaks site fighting against secret information .
letta trustful in the longevity of its government
the president of the italian council enrico letta judges that its government will hold until 2015 in spite of the strong tensions between left and right-hand side within the coalition with the power with the approach of the vote of the senate to wane silvio berlusconi of its mandate .
in an interview with the daily newspaper stampa , the leader of centre left known as to intend “ firmly ” to continue to control with its coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015 .
the upper house of the italian parliament will meet during the course of the month to decide fate of the former president of the council condemned for tax evasion in august .
silvio berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the senate , where it counts more adversaries than partisans , pronounces its dismissal .
but part of its camp , gathered around the national secretary of the people of freedom ( pdl ) angelino alfano , continuous to support the government , like showed it on october 2nd its refusal to yield to the injunctions of berlusconi who already wished to make fall the cabinet .
since more than one year , everywhere , i am capable to note a strong dissatisfaction on behalf of people whom i meet : monstrous revaluation their properties , flood of taxes , cost of the licences of all kinds , general and administration expenses to finish moreover it .
in short , unbounded siphoning of our pockets .
million wasted dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful tax on those which pay .
any removed money of force to the taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment .
in shawinigan , in spite of the closing down of all the major companies , one does not obstruct oneself as for the extravagant expenditure and the maintenance of lame ducks : overdrawn arts centre , strong subsidy in the city of energy , etc
if these installations are not profitable , whether one sells them at the private company or that they are demolished .
it is also upsetting to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry which never came .
i however give a honourable mention to the transformation of old wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator , but to which cost for the payers of taxes ?
it is not with the public stages to invest in such companies , but well with the private sector while being based on the request of the consumer .
the citizens were happy to learn that the lakes with the fishing season and of the piles will continue to supply the city out of drinking water .
following the departure of all industries ( large water consumers ) and with the great decline of the population , the use of water decreased considerably everywhere on the territory .
without meaning to waste it , the city will never miss water and the severe regulation as for its use could be largely softened .
in short , it is quite easy to carry out large things with the money of the others .
i would have shame to defend such an assessment .
with a rough debt of more than 200 million $ , this city is not even able any more to buy a pen without passing by a regulation of loan .
we have been managed for more than 40 years by put on a tie with beautiful diplomas for the majority and i do not believe that a stockbreeder of sheep makes worse .
a worker dies buried under concrete blocks
a worker of construction died buried under tens of morning , concrete blocks thursday , in montreal .
the drama occurred around 11 : 00 , on the street inlays , very close to the intersection of the street beaubien , in the district of rosemont it petite-patrie .
according to any probability , the work carried out on the foundations proceeded at this place for a certain time .
a joint wall of foundation had just been set up during last days .
the accident occurred at the time when the victim had just been able on the building site in order to recover its tools .
i passed by car and i saw the wall collapsing with a large cloud of smoke , said sylvain jean , who remains near the building site .
i am unloaded and i went to remove the large bricks which recovered it .
one saw only part of his back , they are so unhappy .
according to the authorities , the victim is an old man in around fifty which worked for a company of formwork .
operations of reanimation were tried by the emergency services , but without success .
the man did not survive his serious wounds .
an inspector of the commission of health and occupational safety were dispatched on the spot in order to inquire into the circumstances surrounding this drama .
the nsa implicates a “ internal error ” and not of the hackers for the breakdown of his site
the national security agency working in the shade declared friday that it was a bug which had caused the breakdown of its public site during a few hours , and not of the hackers as some had claimed online .
“ nsa.gov remained inaccessible during a few hours this evening because of an internal error which took place during an update envisaged ” , the agency of espionage in a declaration by e-mail indicated .
the problem will be solved this evening .
the allegations according to which the breakdown was due to an attack of distributed denial of service &#91; dsd &#93; are false .
earlier this evening , the trackers of waiters online noted that the site of the nsa had been broken down during at least 6 hours , and certain users cannot still reach the site .
earlier , a spokesperson of the nsa indicated at abc news that the significant internal network of the agency was not “ pas du very ” compromised .
no classified information is in danger , explained the spokesperson .
at least a group of hacktivists online affirmed to be responsible for the breakdown of the site of the nsa by an attack dsd .
attacks dsd aim at flooding a site targeted until the waiters are overloaded and which the site crumbles .
the cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and them attacks are not intended to penetrate in the internal network of the system concerned .
the nsa formerly ultra secret , a time called “ no such agency ” , found itself under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized during last months following a wave of revelations in connection with its vast programs of monitoring of the communications at the national level and abroad – which are part of the secret files of the nsa stolen at the agency and revealed by the former disillusioned consultant of the nsa , edward snowden .
this increasing controversy around the agency caused many speculations according to which the incident of this evening was the result of a targeted cyber-operation .
the delta downtown area now closed
the hotel delta downtown area closed down thursday in montreal , after 36 years of existence .
the investment fund which had the building it sold to promoters who will transform it into student residences .
three hundred and fifty people worked with the hotel .
among them , 200 still did not find new employment .
delta promises not to drop its employees .
employers came to meet employees directly on the spot , one individually met the employees to evaluate their needs .
“ this support will continue for the six next months ” , explains the regional director of the business relations of the hotels delta , félix bisson .
the closing of the delta intervenes in a very competing hotel market .
the investment fund which was owner of this masonry had choices to make .
either it reinvested in the masonry to continue to operate it , therefore there were investments of tens of million whereas the competition is very wild , there are many new hotels which appeared in montreal .
“ or it is sold it to someone else and it is what occurred ” , explains paul arsenault , holder of the pulpit of tourism deckchair at the school of the management sciences of the uqam .
other hotels of montreal will be also converted in the next months , as crown plaza who will become a residence for elderly people .
meanwhile , four hotel projects adding up nearly 600 rooms will come out within two years .
do you want an ice fluo ?
a british entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world containing jellyfish .
charlie francis benefitted from the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent collation .
it had the idea of it after having read a study on the jellyfishes and convinced of the chinese scientists to recreate brilliant protein chemically .
the ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the ph of protein to make it shine .
chris explains that , since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth , more one licks , more it becomes brilliant .
charlie , the founder of the company of ices “ lick me i &apos; m delicious ” , declared : “ it is something of incredible but let us be we yet only at the beginnings in terms of production , and 2 g of this trick cost approximately 200 £ . ”
the protein that we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral ph .
thus when your mouth heats protein , the level of ph increases and the ice starts to shine .
we tested it during last months and it seemed convenient to share it with all at the time of halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice which i created because the luminescence of the jellyfishes is worth four times more expensive than gold .
each ball thus costs me approximately 140 £ .
but it has good taste rather !
the company with the experimental approach of charlie , based at bristol , is known for its unusual perfumes of ice such as beer , cheese , ox and the sheet of gold .
but its next creation is announced even more ambitious .
he added : “ i would like to really develop an invisible ice . ”
it is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the crystals of ice which constitute the ice cream , but i think that i will find a way of arriving there .
the ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by chinese scientists .
a seriously injured in an accident with a phantom driver on the boxing ring of brussels
a road accident made a seriously injured , friday morning around 5 : 30 , on the interior boxing ring of brussels to height of hoeilaart , in the direction of waterloo .
the car of conducting was struck by a phantom driver , which is unscathed for him .
the boxing ring was closed to traffic , until 9 : 00 , towards the accident , time that the road is cleared and that an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
this situation however hardly caused congestions because the accident took place with height of the hoeilaart exit .
circulation consequently could be deviated by this exit / entered of the boxing ring .
a child seriously wounded in an attraction with disneyland paris
a five year old child was seriously wounded following an accident on an attraction with disneyland paris .
its vital prognosis is not committed any more but he is always hospitalized .
at the time of the fall , the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction “ pirates of the caribbean ” .
it was closed until new order .
snowden is ready “ to cooperate ” with germany on the question of the american monitoring
edward snowden , the denouncer of the american intelligence services , declared that it was laid out to go to berlin to testify before the german parliament if the national security agency of the united states and its director keith alexander did not provide answers on their activities .
the german deputy hans-christian ströbele met mr. snowden in russia thursday , where it profits from the right of asylum , to discuss its testimony in germany .
in a letter which the deputy presented to the media in berlin friday , mr. snowden said : “ although the result of my efforts was obviously positive , my government continuous to treat the difference in opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize the political discourse with charges against which it is impossible to be defended . ”
however , to tell the truth is not a crime .
in his letter , mr. snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the us government to give up the penal loads retained against him .
within the framework of the lodged complaint by the american ministry of justice , he is shown of espionage and flight of goods of the state .
hans-peter friedrich , german home secretary , declared in zeit online : “ if mr. snowden is ready to speak to the german officials , we will make in kind make that possible . ”
the relations between the united states and germany were put at severely tested following complaints according to which the nsa had put on listening the mobile phone of the german chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the deputy who directs the parliamentary group supervising the foreign secret services , indicated that if it were likely there to hear mr. snowden as witness “ without endangering it and completely ruining the relations with the united states ” , it was necessary to benefit from it .
mr. ströbele , german green deputy , published a photograph of him with mr. snowden on his twitter account .
at the time of its visit in russia , it was accompanied by two german journalists .
mr. ströbele declared that , according to lawyer of old consulting nsa , mr. snowden could not turn over to russia if it left the country .
if mr. snowden testified in germany , the insurance would have to be given him that it would be in “ security ” over there , declared the deputy .
mr. snowden wrote in his letter that it had been the object of persecution campaign a “ serious and supported ” which had forced it to leave its country .
however , he said that he had been encouraged by the world reaction vis-a-vis “ my act of political expression ” .
the citizens of the whole world as well as the high ranking officials – including in the united states – judged that the revelation of an unexplainable system of permanent monitoring was of public utility .
the letter advances an offer of co-operation with the german authorities “ when the difficulties of this humane situation are solved ” .
a team of biologists directed by wildlife society conservation of new york identified a new species of dolphin with bump with broad as of septentrional coasts of australia .
thibaut bouveroux , scientific operations manager at the observatory for the conservation and the study of the animals and marine environments ( oceamm ) reconsider for l &apos;express this discovery and explain the long process of identification of new species .
does the discovery of this new species of dolphin with bump astonish you ?
it is a good news , but that does not astonish me particularly .
so in the past , the species were described and identified on morphological , anatomical and geographical basis , today , the development of new tools such as the genetics enable us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of the species .
it is not impossible besides that this progress in genetics and molecular biology calls into question the classification or the membership of a species to a kind , a family , and even an order .
at the beginning of the 19th century , the morphologists classified the animals , on basis as of morphological differences between the species .
today , some of these rankings are called into question because as of progress of the genetics .
same manner , two very close species morphologiquement were distinguished thanks to the genetics .
it is the case of the new species which has just been identified .
some ten years ago , the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily : dolphins with bump of the pacific and humpback whales of the atlantic .
the recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species .
why is it about a discovery of importance like affirmed it wildlife society conservation ?
from a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences , in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability .
if this population were already known for a long time by the researchers , they did not know that she belonged to a new species , presents only to this place .
consequently , if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or of accidental capture arises in the area , we could deal with the extinction of a species , rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a species more largely widespread on earth .
this loss of genetic inheritance would be much more problematic .
a species is considered threatened or in way of extinction according to the number of existing individuals on earth , i.e. stock , and possibility that it has to be restored starting from close stocks .
as regards the species sousa chinensis , from which the population of the new species discovered is resulting , its stock automatically became weaker , making it thus more vulnerable .
why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals ?
the marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain .
they live in homogeneous habitats , open , in which there are many genetic exchanges between the populations and the individuals .
this gene mixing limits the creation of new species .
contrary , more closed ecosystems support the genetic insulation , which can in the long term generate the creation of new species .
it should be known that marine environment is the least well-known medium .
one prefers to send robots over mars , that of knowing what lives in the pit of mariannes , with only 11 kilometers of sea surface .
one spends more money in research of life on another planets than in marine research and it is high time that changes .
cleave micrometer caliper claims that the deputy tony abbott has a conflict of interest concerning the system of parental leave .
the deputy billionaire cleaves micrometer caliper advances that the prime minister tony abbott has a conflict of interest concerning the system of parental leave because his / her daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system .
the tycoon of the mining extraction , which disputes the payment of a tax carbon of an amount of 6 m $ , put forward this argument to try to draw aside the questions concerning a possible conflict .
palmer united party could control up to four votes with the senate , which could be crucial at the time to decide if the taxes carbon and mines must be removed .
but mr. palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that the girls of mr. abbott were ready to profit personally from these policies .
“ it will have an important conflict of interest when it is a question of paying the parental leave because if one of his / her daughters is pregnant , he will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtains or not a leave ” , mr. palmer declared .
two months after its election , the electoral commission officially declared that mr. palmer gained the head office of sunshine coast de fairfax by 53 votes , after recount .
mr. palmer has advanced the idea of a rehandling of the system of skin of the votes to accelerate the process .
girls of tony abbott , frances and bridget .
should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished ?
“ we need a better system ” , he declared .
why couldn &apos;t we have a system in which you can enter , seize your contact in a computer , vote immediately and to have the result at 6 : 30 the next morning ?
mr. palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the paper ballots .
is this to be able to delete the result if somebody is not agreement ?
nowadays , to have a paper pencil seems extraordinary .
the electoral commission studied the possible options with regard to the e-voting and recently published a discussion paper united with new zealand .
mr. palmer , 59 years , declared that its political project understood an international airport for sunshine coast and that it would very take his new functions “ with serious ” .
the performance of civil services is a question of public service .
“ we do not seek a reward , except the reward of the history because we must be used the community for one critical moment ” , he added .
when many experts in equestrian demonstrations met in cardiff to clash and gain the trophy of the horse of the year , they knew that the competition would be hard .
but nobody expected to see gaining peg wood kirkland , a three year old child .
not yet at the school and only a few months after having begun his first career , the toddler and his pony the shetland toffee trotted during the three turns with a great facility and gained the first price , leaving behind them the 30 other adult competitors .
the two inseparable ones – which is same size – were greeted for the presentation , the attitude and the style at the time of the annual competition which proceeded at the sunnybank equestrian center , with rudry close to cardiff .
presenting itself against men and women out of elegant bowler hats , it carried its cap punt a little on the side in a way relaxed to make ravel its toffee pony 2 years old around the track .
peg wood was greeted by the judges for its natural qualities of raising not very common for a child of its age .
and toffee received very high notes for its presentation and its personality .
peg wood had toffee in gift for its 3rd birthday last march and was involved since with its shetland pony the every day .
his / her mother gave , 30 years , declared : “ peg wood and toffee make an excellent duet . ”
they were presented towards and against all , but both nicked the gold cut and the rivet washer .
it was only the second time that it contributed with toffee and we were insane of joy which it gained .
on the track , people who did not know it thought that it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be made photograph with him .
this young boy , from the village of nantyglo , close to ebbw vale , in the south of wales , follows the traces of his aunt sharon howells , who has taken part in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years .
mrs. howells declared : “ there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it . ”
he traversed all the length of the track while running and even if he seemed to be very small , he did a marvellous job .
peg wood is insane animals – he adores the horses , the tractors and the rural world and has two chickens of which he occupies himself .
way in which it started , it will take part surely soon in the manifestation of the horse of the year – and i am sure that it will make a beautiful service .
a spokesperson of the annual equestrian demonstration declared : “ peg wood is only 3 years old but it knows how to lead its pony . ”
they train a good team .
the judges noticed that peg wood and toffee presented well and the way in which they ravelled on the track .
they search an effective team work between the pony and the tamer – peg wood and toffee were the best on the track .
i am sure that his beautiful clothing helped peg wood , it had really proud pace .
the minister for defense , rob nicholson , insisted to say that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the canadian armed forces , and stressed that a transition process was followed by all the soldiers before their return to the civil life .
attacked by the liberals and the néo-democrats with the house of commons , mr. nicholson ensured that before their release , the members of the army followed a plan of transition in collaboration with their superiors .
all the wounded soldiers receive the suitable care for their return to the civil life and none of them is released before being ready , he affirmed .
the detractors show the government to want to save money while not allowing the wounded soldiers - who do not answer the rule of “ the universality of the service ” of the army requiring that staff be able to carry out a series of varied tasks - to reach the period of 10 years admissibility necessary for the services of retirement .
they in particular quoted two cases brought back by the canadian press , of which that of a soldier released last friday .
the corporal david hawkins , a reservist of london , in ontario , reached post-traumatic syndrome of stress , was released from the army in spite of his request to remain one year more in order to being able to receive a fully indexed retirement .
its case occurred after that of the corporal glen kirkland , who declared before a parliamentary committee , last month , which it had been thorough towards the exit before being ready because it did not answer the rule of universality of the service .
mr. hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave , with plans and meetings of consultation , but that was completely different that the fact of wanting to leave the rows .
“ i told them that i was not ready ” , he affirmed at the time of an interview with the canadian press wednesday .
i asked during months if there were a means so that i can remain , and they said not .
since the beginning as of major combat in afghanistan , the army pains to determine which latitude it can grant to the wounded soldiers who want to remain in the rows , but which are not suited to the combat .
under the terms of the current rules , the seriously wounded soldiers have up to three years to be restored .
if they do not answer the criteria for the deployments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
data submitted last year to the parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons , 199 had not reached the necessary working life to obtain services of retirement .
the liberal spokesperson as regards veterans , jim karygiannis , asked wednesday for the rehabilitation of the corporal hawkins , while the néo-democrat jack harris claimed the immediate end of “ this ashamed practice ” .
air raid against military installations in syria
according to the lebanese army , israeli planes entered the airspace lebanese wednesday at the beginning of afternoon , but strikings took place in the evening .
a cargo of ground-to-air missiles of short range sa-8 would have been targeted and destroyed .
this new raid of the aviation of tsahal in syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the israeli daily newspaper haaretz ) was confirmed neither by israel nor by syria .
the raid proceeded in circumstances about identical to that which had taken place on july 5th : at the time , it is also an anonymous american person in charge who had confirmed in cnn an israeli attack , aiming this time of the missiles ground-mer yakhont , delivered by russia at damas .
the israeli persons in charge had not hidden their irritation to see washington revealing the attack , with the risk to oblige president assad to react .
life imprisonment for a former chinese vice-governor
a former vice-governor of the province of jilin , in the north-east of china , was condemned friday to the life imprisonment for corruption .
excluded from the communist party in july 2012 , tian xueren was shown to have touched more than 19 million yuans of bribes , bring back the chinese official mediums .
between 1995 and 2001 , the vice-governor , who was also the president of the bank of jilin , a public corporation , helped undertaken and persons in charge to secure contracts , loans or promotions in return for money or of gifts , declared the first court intermediate of beijing on its microblog .
president xi jinping , who took up his post last march , made fight against corruption a national priority , estimating that the phenomenon constituted a threat with the existence-even of the communist party .
if the head of the state promised that justice would be as intractable with powerful “ the tigers ” as with the “ flies ” - the civils servant subordinates - only a handful of persons in charge of high ranking were condemned , among which former executives of the petrochina oil giant .
the recent case most spectacular was that of the former chief of the pcc with chongqing , bo xilai , condemned to life in september for corruption and abuse of power after having aimed at the high positions within the state .
but the government at all did not express the intention to reform the system of fight against corruption by creating for example an independent organism of the party .
the benefit of bomber in fall , whereas the deliveries and the orders of planes move back
bomber inc , aeronautical and railway manufacturer canadian , announced a fall of 15 % of its net earning thursday , under the pressure of a fall of the orders and deliveries of planes during the third quarters and problems contractual in its division trains .
bomber , based in montreal , either did not provide data of in-flight test for its very new cseries plane nor of information making it possible to know if the plane will respect its ambitious calendar of commissioning commercial before next september .
after the inaugural flight of the plane of test there are approximately a month and half , this last stole only three times , and the question then arose of knowing if the phase of test were in right track .
the results were not worthy of forecasts and the exchange stocks moved back of 8 % at toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst within national bank financial , lowered his notation thursday , passing from “ surperformance ” with “ performance of sector ” because of the low potential of rise in the stock market during the next quarter or two next quarters .
“ although the fall of the deliveries of planes was mainly anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in division transport ” , cameron doerksen in a note with the customers declared .
we think that bomber will record new orders for its cseries planes as the test routine in flight advances .
however , if no new order is announced during next months , we expect that the market becomes more skeptical about the program .
bomber hopes that the family of cseries planes will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first plane of test was revealed in march and flew away for the first time in september after months of delay .
but the number of firm controls for the cseries planes is modest until now to a total value of 177 . it seems that the potential buyers expect the results of in-flight tests to validate the assertions of the company concerning the energy efficiency and the potential of economies of the new airliner .
at present , the company recorded a total of 403 orders and undertakings to buy near 15 customers and operators .
pierre beaudoin , president and chief of the direction , is convinced that bomber will achieve its goal of 300 firm controls before the commissioning commercial of the first plane .
the leaders also reassured the analysts and the media thursday in their indicating that the program advanced in accordance with the calendar .
“ the plane of test did not remain on the ground longer than envisaged ” , mr. beaudoin at the time of a conference call declared , adding that the ground tests and the software updates were envisaged during the downtime of the plane .
each manufacturer plans in a different way .
we had decided to carry out a first flight and to envisage one period of update , and it is what we did .
that will reproduce throughout the program of vol .
the second of the five planes of test should fly away in the weeks to come , the others will follow little time after , indicated the company .
however , the analysts are skepticals as for the fact that the first customer can make fly a cseries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight .
bomber indicated that it was evaluating the calendar of service entrance and will provide new information during next months .
“ this slowness of in-flight tests – although it is apparently in conformity with the internal calendar of bomber – reinforces our opinion according to which the service entrance will be pushed back in first quarter of 2015 ” , mr. doerksen declared .
with the closed third quarters on september 30th , the net earning of bomber fell to 147 m $ , or 8 hundreds per action , compared to 172 m $ , or 9 hundreds per action , one year earlier .
the per share earnings adjusted remained unchanged to 9 hundreds .
the incomes slightly moved back from 4.2 to 4.1 md $ .
the analysts expected a result of 10 hundreds per action and the incomes of 4.56 md $ , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the fourth aeronautical manufacturer in the world indicated that it had delivered 45 planes during the quarter , against 57 one year earlier .
the clear orders fell to 26 planes , against 83 before .
the delay in aeronautical division accounted for 32.9 md $ at september 30th , quantifies unchanged compared to on december 31st of the previous year .
“ in aeronautics , the results were in conformity with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and the general terms of the market were disappointing ” , mr. beaudoin declared .
the incomes of aeronautics dropped by 13 % to reach 2 md $ .
bomber , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , declared that the incomes of this division had increased of almost 11 % with 2.1 md $ .
the order book of division transport added up 32.6 md $ at september 30th , that is to say a light rise compared to on december 31st of the previous year .
the margins of division transport suffered from the problems of execution concerning some large contracts .
the leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarters .
the stock exchange of bomber , which also announced that patrick pichette , chief of the financial management of google inc , would sit at the board of directors , fell of 8.5 % to 4.83 canadian dollars in the afternoon of thursday .
the brazilian company embraer sa , third aeronautical manufacturer in the world and competitor nearest to bomber , indicated thursday a fall of 10 % of its quarterly earning .
the kenyan press is indignant at the controversial law on the media
“ it is an alarming country and it is legitimate to raise the following question : what will prevent the parliament from sweeping the independence of the legal system tomorrow ? ” , the newspaper declared by disputing the government bill and requiring so that he be declared unconstitutional .
“ this law is draconian and very punitive , and let us refuse we it ” , explained cyrus kamau , chief executive officer of group capital – owner of capitalfm , one of the radio stations and independent websites of news the most respected in kenya .
it indicated that the new court of the media “ will be always partial because it is about a prolongation of the government ” and that the restrictions relating to the contents and publicity would harm instead of kenya in the worldwide economy .
“ i hope that the president will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this government bill and to return it in front of the members of parliament ” , he added .
according to the newspaper the star , the new government bill will make it possible the government to have “ the seizure on the media ” . standard the , as for him , indicated that the democracy and freedom of opinion in kenya “ had undergone a heavy blow ” and fustigated the government bill describing it as “ draconian ” .
the adoption of the government bill intervenes at the same time as series of measures aiming at reinforcing the national security in the wake of the attack perpetrated by the islamist ones armed in the shopping centre with westgate last september .
the kenyan media caused the anger of the authorities by diffusing images of cameras of vidéosurveillance on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack concealed the shopping centre of luxury supposedly .
the chief of the police , david kimaiyo , reacted by convening two journalists and a person in charge of the media to question them , although the convocation was withdrawn following raised shields in the media .
under the terms of the new government bill , the media could be liable to fines going up to 20 million kenyan shillings and the journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk to be “ erased ” or to more be able to receive accreditation presses official .
the court also has the power to seize the goods of a contravener if this one did not pay its fine .
according to daily nation , “ even only one fine is enough to paralyse most fm stations ” .
he also says that measurements could have a devastating effect on what he described like the “ animated blogosphere ” of kenya .
by reducing the media to silence , the politicians know that they can do what they want in all impunity .
“ nobody will never know ” , wrote mutuma mathiu , journalist with the nation , by describing the kenyan media like a source of key control in the public life .
“ delivered to themselves , the politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and would bring back for us to hunting and the gathering . ”
the kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the population in the past .
in may , they came out against the cuts ordered by the national commission in charge of the wages and restored their fabulous wages of approximately 532 000 shillings per month tax-free – which appears among highest in the world .
two speleologists of 23 and 27 years were reported missing in a pit under the tooth from crolles since thursday evening , one learned friday at spéléo help from isere .
they were localised this friday - afternoon .
the two men , one hardened with the practice and the other not , had left under ground thursday around 21 : 30 in order to carry out a crossing of the tooth of crolles , located on the commune of saint-pierre-of-charterhouse .
one was then without news of them since , specified the same source .
“ the speleologists should have arisen in the neighbourhoods of 5 : 00 of the morning ” , thierry larribe , technical advisor in spéléo help in charge of the organization of the helps said .
tens of people on the spot
about twenty first-aid workers , ten civil members of spéléo french help , as well as gendarmes , crs and firemen were on the spot .
in end of the afternoon this friday , the two speleologists were localised .
“ it is another group of speleologists which , after having found them exhausted but in good health in the cavity , transmitted information to the one of the rescue teams engaged in the network ” explains the dauphine one .
the two soldiers with the 13th battalion of the alpine hunters of chambéry , were found “ exhausted , but nonwounded ” .
they were lost in the network , are turned over on their steps while waiting for the helps , specified the prefecture .
réalimentés , they should arise from the cavity with the assistance of the first-aid workers in the evening .
an inhabitant of aubervilliers launches his party of the suburbs
we do not mislead especially .
in the spirit of abdel-malik djermoune , his founder , the “ party of the suburbs ” does not address solely to the commuters .
i chose a map of france like logo , justifies t it .
when i speak about suburbs , i address myself to all those which are excluded from the national large family .
it prevented , its project , presented thursday in press conference in its native commune of aubervilliers , was born from the will to better defend the multiculturalism , this large melting cultural pot which characterizes before all the districts .
my n ° 1 proposal is to create a ministry for the multiculturalism , indicates t it .
abdel-malik djermoune , 50 years , territorial attache , asserts himself today as “ 100 % apolitical ” even if it were not always neutral .
militant in 2002 at the sides of jean-pierre chevénement , it then locally supported dominique de villepin between 2010 and 2011 .

“ the declarations crashing to pieces on the “ foreigners turning over at the end of the file ” and “ of employment for the australian ones initially ” are an unpleasant return at the time where the trade unions asked a protected job market ” , she said to australia india institute today .
historically , that meant that the work of the white was to be protected – and i would not be surprised that certain countries of the area see there like an echo with this historical artifact .

the minister for the immigration brendan o &apos;connor , which was in sri lanka to meet high ranking officials in order to discuss the traffic of human beings , implemented five of the changes recommended , the others being under examination .
if the criterion “ of authenticity ” were adopted , an applicant of visa could be controlled to know “ if the job offer is authentic if the candidate is a relation or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company which sponsors it ” .

reconsideration of the right to the abortion in texas
a federal court of call restored in texas certain restrictions on the right of voluntary interruption of pregnancy which had been blocked by a judge of first authority this week .
this judgement means that legal text adopted in july in this state and calling largely into question the right to the abortion will be able to come into effect .
the judgment delivered by the court of appeal means that the doctors who will practise ivg must have a “ privilege of admission ” near the local hospitals .
the privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , under the terms of his statute of member looking after of a hospital , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center in order to deliver a diagnosis or a treatment there .
the defenders of the ivg make the point that the contents of the law are likely to result in an immediate closing of a third of the private clinics of the state because these private clinics did not succeed in obtaining this “ privilege of admission ” for their experts .
on the whole , it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be private of an access to these establishments .
monday , a judge of first authority had estimated the day before the coming into effect of the law that the provisions treating of the privilege of admission were anticonstitutional .
but the attorney general of texas , the republican greg abbott , who aspires to the post of governor , asked the court of appeal to cancel the judgement of first authority which blocked the application of the law .
a plenary audience on this question is planned for january .

tuesday , this 43 year old patient had been suspected of being reached , after being returned of saudi arabia , a country where the disease already caused about fifty deaths .
the 22 years top model does not begin its career with the cinema with the small door .
the director lars von trier chose it to incarnate young charlotte gainsbourg in nymphomaniac , his next film .
this pornographic drama shells , in eight chapters which will leave in two shutters ( january 1st and 8th , 2014 ) , the erotic memories of a fortysomething addict to the sex since its adolescence .
the resemblance of stacy martin to its elder is striking : a silhouette of brushwood , a diaphanous dye and franco-english origins .
without forgetting a certain taste for danger : that which had not hesitated to pose naked over glazed paper will be displayed in situations much more sulfurous on big screen .
an extract of nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the web : stacy martin appears there with the bed and in full ecstasy with shia labeouf .
if the provocative scenario writer asked his actors to put their decency at the wall cupboard , it had recourse to professionals of x for the most dared scenes of sex , before amalgamating all the bodies numerically : above the belt , it is the star ; below , the lining .
de björk with charlotte gainsbourg , via nicole kidman , lars von trier has as a practice to always push its actresses in their last cuttings off , for the best .
stacy martin did not finish making speak about it .
five years ago already that my father deleted world of the alive ones .
at the beginning i denied his death , i spoke about him at the present ,
i was afraid so much to forget it or rather i did not know how i was going to continue “ to attend it ” .
there does not exist receipt , of instructions to pass the wall of invisible and to find to them his .
then signs appeared .
the first time it was very extremely felt its presence on the momentary seat whereas i led .
another time , a soft alarm clock as a middle of the night to look at her watch which does not leave me any more , posed on the night table .
it is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my gestures with the daily newspaper .
our mother left us after her combat exhausting against cancer .
it is at least what i thought the day when i found his body empty , contracted on this hospital bed to ruffled cloths .
in the same way , its funeral was an icy good-bye focused around the thin gleam of the candles which framed its coffin .
i thought that it had left .
little by little , by small diurnal or night appearances , a little timid , a little deleted , it quickly returned in my spirit , evolving as it took again its place in the landscape of my thought which was believed in mourning .
and then , it appeared all while revealing me my own facets which i had not perceived yet , masked by my relation with it .
i thus learned and understood that i had not at all lost the person of my mother but simply a woman whom i really did not know , a woman who incarnated this person , during his stay in the life .
while dying , this woman had perfect her life and released the person whom i loved , and here that i found it , full and whole .
this turning of the way of my life remains most unexpected and most beautiful .
it is a privilege of knowing that loved people never leave us .
i resemble to my father , “ with the inside as with the outside ” it appears .
it was always told to me .
i never believed it at the time .
i had difficult relations with him until it becomes old , sick .
there , i was not any more afraid of him and i could like it .
one day , he died .
for a long time , it accompanied me : when i stopped smoking , when i was afraid , when i had badly …
he spoke , to me encouraged me constantly , he lived my body .
i saw his hands by looking at mine , i lent my body to him .
but it was never indiscreet .
i could have a personal life .
it left me my intimacy .
that lasted a long time then a day it left .
finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
i do not know any more who said that the people deceased are not forgotten but of the invisible ones .
my parents are not any more but i constantly feel them close to me .
each event , each moment of my life makes me feel their presence because i always refer to it : what would they have said ? what would they have thought ? what would have they makes ?
i dreamed constantly of them , perhaps not every night but several times per week it is certain .
i often dreamed of the last moments that i must share with them before it is too late , only , there am always a thing which prevented me from achieving this moment .
i often awake distressed when that arrives to me and i feel their absence deeply .
sometimes , some dreamed carry me on the contrary and fall under my history and indeed , they continue to live and share my life .
the my echography day before where i was to know the sex of my baby , i dreamed that i awoke , i rose out of bed , my father waited me on the stage and he smiled me and was delighted until i expect a little boy .
the following day , i had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean me that he shared with joy what arrived to me .
and of course , it was a little boy in my belly .
i liked to share this moment with him and i take pleasure in telling this common memory lived after his death .
precisely five years ago , my grandmother died of the continuations of a cancer .
one year before , it was on a journey with my family in cuba .
it is to say the shock which its disappearance caused at the young graduate who i was at the time .
i despite everything carried out my mourning rather quickly .
but it continues to influence my life , in particular in the moments when i am in difficulty , or when i must make important decisions .
to learn arabic and to interest me in the middle east , at the point to make a master degree in an university of it , were not , with the passing , of the pain-killers choices .
in fact , i often heard it to speak arab in my childhood , and of morocco , where she had lived during decades - before regaining france at the time of independence .
the values that she inculcated to me are always present , so that it sometimes happens to me to think of how she would like that i act at a given time .
the same applies to my attitudes : i try to be worthy of the generosity and of the uprightness of spirit of that which was enthusiastic believing .
from now on , i feel it like a daily presence , a benevolent heart , a saving spirit .
i see his eyes being posed on me .
my mother died nineteen years ago now .
died after me to have spoken on the telephone .
i passed by all the phases : incomprehension , anger , the pain , the tears which only start , anywhere , any time , in unusual places , incongruous moments .
then , time alleviated the sorrow .
remained only the lack , this vacuum without answer , to entrust this need for it , to me , to reassure themselves with the hollow of its softness .
however , it is there , quiet presence , it is there and looks at me .
every morning , i see his anxious eyes being posed on me , i see the rings which weigh down its glance , the small wrinkles around the lips which the cigarettes dig , the folds which mark the face the surfaces of concern .
my mother took possession of my face and it looks at me every morning in my mirror .
and every morning , i divert the eyes .
my wife and the mother of my 3 children died of a cancer at 43 years .
one permanently feels his protection , nothing low register cannot arrive to us .
it was its promise on its bed of pain , then one gradually relearned to smile , and to pronounce its name is not any more taboo but a comfort .
of course , i speak to him in the hollow about the night when the absence makes too badly , it invites myself in my dreamed when the moral one is reached a little .
we feel carried and protected in the difficult moments , the retreat of time makes us realize how much it was orchestra conductor and we try to remain in the way that it had traced us .
if a being loved you very extremely , the absence cannot tear off it to you heart and memories .
in a certain way , the loved being becomes your interior energy .
i lost my father on august 22nd , 2008 of the continuations of a cancer of asbestos .
i was very close to him , i always acted according to what he thought or of what he appreciated .
i could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death , i gave birth to a little boy .
if i have my convictions sometimes different as of his , i always wonder if my intrigues are in conformity with its vision of the things .
i had besides problems in my work for these convictions .
for me , it is impossible to go in a contrary direction , i do not sleep about it and i always wonder what he will think .
i do not know if i adopted his way of being or if i am simply like him : is this genetic ?
in any event , it will be always my reference .
it was a little like an alter-ego , it did not need there to speak between us .
in short , it is there with the daily newspaper .
i feel his presence and that returns to me happy .
here are soon thirty years that my husband is deceased at the 33 years age .
i had 28 years and our son 6 years .
the immense sorrow which then invaded me is of course attenuated but it is always close to me .
very often it “ unloads ” in my dreamed in a so precise way , if alive that with the alarm clock i am even sadder to note than it only one was not dreamed .
the other night , he asked to me whether i were well , i told him not , he answer me “ i go down ” but of a so real voice that i awoke in start , distressed and i lit the bedside lamp by looking at everywhere , persuaded that he was going to arrive .
i always live in the same house , and often , i feel observed and i am turned over to see whether it is not there , i know that it is him and i speak to him .
in all the parts i feel his presence and that returns to me happy .
for nothing in the world i would not leave this house where we were happy and or its spirit lives with me .
i am 58 years old , i always lived only since his departure , there is and will remain the love of my life .
i make a point of specifying that i am sociable with a trade with responsibility , i laugh and i sing , i leave , i am grandmother , i have full with friends , but my heart and my heart belong to him and i never speak about him except with my son , and i never go to the cemetery .

mohamed morsi lent the oath of nomination , but it is not very probable that its day of triumph marks the end of the political conflicts in egypt .
islamist mohamed morsi promised the emergence of a “ egypt news ” when it lent the oath of nomination to the presidency , becoming thus the first chair freely elected and succeeding hosni moubarak who was driven out power 16 month earlier .
during his nomination before the high constitutional court , mr. morsi also became the first islamist president freely elected arab world and the fifth head of state of egypt since the inversion of monarchy 60 years ago .
it lent oath in front of the 18 judges out of black dress of the court whose building located in edge of the nile was built to resemble an egyptian temple .
“ we aspire to better following days , an egypt news and a second republic ” , stated president morsi during the solemn ceremony diffused live on public television .
“ today , the egyptian people posed the bases of a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability ” , explained mr. morsi , engineer a 60 year old trained in the united states , resulting from the muslim brothers , a fundamentalist group considered during more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and hard repressed by the successive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers kept the building when mr. morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours , local time , followed by a small convoy .
only a few hundreds of supporters had gathered before the court to acclaim the new president and , dissociating presidential ostentation of the years mubarak , circulation only was briefly stopped to allow the passage of its convoy in the very attended streets connecting the downtown area to the southern suburbs .
regarded as the not very charismatic “ spare wheel ” of the muslim brothers , his personal prestige was reinforced considerably since its victory and its speech of friday during which it tried to be presented as the candidate not only the islamist ones but of all those which want to finish the work started during the rising of 2011 against authoritative president mubarak .
“ egypt is today a civil status , national , constitutional and modern ” , mohamed morsi declared , in blue costume and puts on a tie red , addressing to the judges present in the room decorated with woodworks where it lent oath .
later , mr. morsi went to the university of cairo where he made his speech of nomination .
it was officially accommodated by a military brass band which played the national anthem whereas it was put at the attention .
the marshal hussein tantaoui attended the ceremony .
on its arrival , it was accommodated by the song “ the people and the army , hand in the hand … ” struck up by thousands of people gathered in the large amphitheatre of the university .
founded in 1908 and old bastion of laic education , the university of cairo became later a stronghold of the islamist groups of students in the years 1970 .
mr. morsi has made oath symbolic system friday on place tahrir , from where the rising left which put an end to the authoritarian regime of mubarak last year , and swore to recover the presidential powers whose military council , which replaced the former ousted president , dispossessed it .
but while agreeing to officially lend oath before the court , rather than before the parliament as it is of use , it is inclined in front of the will of the army by showing that the fight for the power is not finished .
the speech of mr. morsi on the tahrir place was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures .
the airframe manufacturers quarrel about the width of the seats whereas large orders are concerned
the argument made fumes between the large aeronautical manufacturers in connection with the width of the seats of the economy class on the long-distance flights , opening up the way for a bitter confrontation at the time of the aeronautical living room of dubai who takes place of month .
the conflict relates to the width of the seats proposed on the long-distance flights to the passengers of the economic class – who always are not courted by the airline companies , but to which allocated space is essential to increase the profits of effectiveness in the last devices presented by airbus sas and boeing co .
this week , airbus invited the aircraft industry to set up a standard imposing a size of seat of at least 18 inches ( 45.72 cm ) in the economic classes , but its large american rival boeing declares that it should be with the airline companies to decide .
the disagreement burst whereas the airframe manufacturers seek to sell versions even larger of theirs twin-engine long-distance planes , by possibly hoping for a record of orders at the time of the event which will proceed from november 17th to november 21st .
the way in which the seats will be laid out in the back of the plane – will in particular , be there 9 or 10 seats of face – is essential for the economic output of the segment of the “ mini-jumbos ” .
boeing declares that its “ 777x ” refitted will be able to accommodate in economic class 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches broad , and will be configured with 10 seats per line .
airbus indicates that the concurrent version of its a350 will transport in economic class 350 people in seats of 18 inches broad configured in lines of 9 .
the giants of aeronautics often exchange blows on technology matters by making publicity in the professional press .
today , airbus calls some directly with the public before the aeronautical living room of dubai , where the 777x should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders .
one could realize recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation with financial of a photograph showing three people the ones against the others with the restaurant , entitled “ you would accept that ? ” .
“ boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats narrower than on the aircraft regional turbopropellers ” , john leahy , sales director of airbus indicated .
as the dietary habits change , people grow bigger , but the seats on the aircraft radically did not change .
between the beginning of the years 1970 , when jumbo 747 of boeing defined the modern long-distance travel , and the turning of the century , the weight of the average american from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 % , according to the data of the american department of health .
the waist measurement of the average american of the 21st century is of 39.7 inches , according to the american medical statistics .
airbus declares that its rival clings to a concept of seat which dates from the years 1950 , when the circumference of the device coldly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .
airbus adds that it ordered a study which indicates that an additional inch on the level of the width of the seats would improve quality of the sleep of 53 % .
boeing disputes the figures of airbus with regard to the width of the seats and affirms that is not to the manufacturers to decide way in which the airline companies balance the price of the tickets and the equipment .
he also says that the study shows that the experiment in cabin does not depend only on the width of the seats .
“ it is really a question of bringing flexibility to the airline companies and of enabling them to do what they think of having to make to undertake to good their activities ” , kent craver declared , in charge of satisfaction passengers at boeing .
they do not want that one tells them what will enable them to be profitable .
they know their company better than anybody .
for the passengers , it is more a question of having a certain freedom of movement , but for the suppliers , it is more and more a question which could affect their results .
behind the argument a race with the orders of planes for an amount estimated from at least 700 md $ at the cost of market in the decades hiding place to come , sufficiently to tip the scales of american and european exports .
comme reuters indicated it for the first time in july , the configuration of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the very last devices .
airbus and boeing assert both an output by seat in their last models of long-distance twin-engines 20 % higher than that of the leader of the market in this segment , boeing 777-300er of 365 seats .
the performances announced by boeing depend partly on the comparison between the 777x configured with 10 seats per line and a model 777 of origin configured in lines of 9 .
the profit in terms of unit costs is currently weak compared to the device configured with 10 seats per line in service .
“ boeing does that to be able to put more seats and to make its planes more competitive by reports to our products ” , kevin keniston , director of momentary comfort at the european airframe manufacturer declared airbus .
on another side , the analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per line in 777 what exists suggest that many passengers decide in favour of a denser configuration , which can go hand in hand with less expensive rates .
“ a width of seat of 18 inches would be perfect for the passengers , but reality is that , from the commercial point of view , the proposal of airbus is justified by the threat of the 777 ” , declared the expert one in interiors of cabins mary kirby , founder and editor-in-chief of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers among whom the airline companies must choose .
the salesmen of planes which go the world carry even with them one meter to check the concurrent configurations .
while being windy to propose comfortable devices , all the manufacturers also offer planes with configurations to strong density with the airline companies low-cost and for the regional travel .
airbus offers a350 configured with 10 seats per line but indicates that it did not sell it yet .
until recently , airbus emphasized the need for a greater personalization of the cabins by offering broader seats side gone on some of its planes .
without the support of alone the other large manufacturer of large modern devices , the experts say that it is not very probable that his call to the aircraft industry in order to set up a standard of size for the seats succeeds , but that it could make forget the wave of sales of 777x .
the adaptation by guillaume nicloux of the novel of denis diderot is prided on a remarkable artistic director and a meticulous reconstitution of time , but it is also harder than it would not owe the being .
being held in france of the years 1760 , she tells it murky story of suzanne , a young aristocrat sent in a convent by her family .
when she rebels , she copes with cruelty without terminal of a deliberately sadistic mother superior and becomes an erotic object of fascination for another .
the film never pours in the lustfulness nor sensationalism , and it is well the problem .
the conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penitence for the public .
the musical , this animal of scene
classics , sophisticated , popular , in english or french , the sung and danced productions take their take-off .
after broadway and london , paris finds finally its voice .
it is a revolution : the musical french one is affirmed like a kind with success .
a long time , notre-dame de paris with mozart the rock opera , most attempts were trapped in the ridiculous one .
and the successes like cabaret or les misérables carried the aureole of the mystery .
the arrival of jean-luc choplin to châtelet and entertainment internship in mogador changed gives it .
today , these two scenes handle the titles like tubes with success .
the first begins again , this christmas , his excellent my fair lady and announcement for the following the world creation of “ an american in paris ” .
in mogador , “ the beautiful one and the animal ” could wellness one of successes of the season .
on the other scenes , the musical productions like “ 1789 ” , “ the lovers of the bastille ” and the small musicals like “ disco music ” or “ life and times ” put at the tuning fork success and quality .
patrick niedo , author of the book of reference “ stories of musicals ” and lecturer to the theatre of châtelet , analyzes the reasons of success conquered so hard .
how do the french musicals evolve ?
the offer was geared down .
there are initially the “ musical productions ” who evolve with the liking of the producers …
some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789 , the lovers of the bastille .
others leap up a fifteen years behind under pretext which one can serve about anything when one has matt pokora at the top of poster .
afterwards , there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of châtelet which make us revive the golden age of broadway and discover the universe of stephen sondheim , the largest alive composer .
entertainment internship popularizes anglo-saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in french .
the independent french producers try an opening .
but of the projects in progress like “ rent ” , “ the kiss of the woman spider ” or “ the awakening of spring ” has difficulty being financed .
do we have enough artists able as in broadway of singer , to play and dance ?
in paris , when there are eight musical productions in one season , it is a great year .
we have 200 artists of talent who turn of projects in projects .
in the united states , cradle of the musical , it is very different .
the young people are trained with these trades in many schools .
employment is numerous between the regional theatres , rounds , broadway , off-broadway …
the fish pond of talents is as consequent as the number of positions of power .
why the rounds in province have do success as much ?
except for the opera , the province remains the poor relation of the culture in france .
few plays leave in round and it is often light comedies intended to the adults and not for the young adults .
the musical productions fill this lack .
they are these same young people who like the reality tv and what it produces like transitory stars …
to propose beautiful young men ( often talented ) at the top of poster of a musical production , it is the insurance of a passion of these young girls and often of their whole family .
the facebook pages of these shows are learnedly held by professionals who answer the questions .
these shows are very expected when they arrive in a zenith of province .
mayonnaise is assembled to paris and is tasted by the provincial ones .
the show is conceived to enter all the big rooms of france in the same form as to paris .

ben greenman : tenth birthday of the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
one could say that the town of new york is the place where was born the stand-up in america : almost 100 years ago , the actor of light comedy frank fay , which held the role of master of ceremony with the de luxe hotel theatre , on broadway , started to tell jokes directly in front of the public , on the ton of the conversation .
the innovation of fay remained over the years , until being taken again more recently by the new york comedy festival .
created and supervised by caroline hirsch , the founder of the club of carolines stand-up , the festival celebrates its tenth birthday this year , with more than 60 shows introduced in small clubs and grand theatres .
“ most tops of the bill emerged in carolines , and had great success , until they became too famous to play in a club ” , hirsch declared .
we created this festival with an aim of being able to continue to work with them .
the event of this year will see the participation of wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher and the presentation of “ stand up for heroes ” , one evening of comedy and music to the profit as of veterans , organized in madison square garden , to which will be present , inter alia , bruce springsteen , jon stewart , roger waters and bill cosby .
the festival gained in importance , just like the world of the comedy .
several of the actors taking part in the festival of this year passed by nontraditional circuits , by introducing for example shows on small tv channels , like central comedy , fx and spike .
nick kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ( “ the league ” on the topic of the fantasy football joyfully lascivious of chain fxx ) and has from now on his own show of sketches on central comedy .
jenny slate took part in the emission “ saturday night live ” and belonged to the casting of the series “ parks and re-creation ” , but it is however more known for its series of viral videos “ marcel the shell with shoes one ” .
kroll and slate , as well as other young actors with the singular voice ( the surrealist pessimist anthony jeselnik , the ironic defender of racial justice w. beautiful kamau ) , are pure products of the decentralized world of the american comedy .
one of the independent factors of attraction of the festival this year will be a maintenance : david steinberg discussing with larry david .
steinberg started as an actor of stand-up , but he became a director of achieved cinema and television , as well as a semi-official historian of the comedy .
between 2005 and 2007 , it animated an emission on tv land which was called “ sit down comedy with david steinberg ” .
the appointment takes place with the town hall , in the center of manhattan .
“ the city is definitively in the comic dna of all the work of larry ” , steinberg declared .
he told me that , when he was here , sometimes he descended a lane between two buildings and said himself well , if i lose all my money , perhaps which i will come to live here .

one of the most sophisticated tunnels being useful for the drug trafficking between the united states and mexico , having of its own lighting systems , ventilation and electric rails , was discovered .
the american authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secrete ways which they had ever seen .
the tunnel , zigzagant over a length equivalent to nearly six football fields length , connects warehouses close to tijuana , in mexico , in san diego , the united states .

three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intention of sale .
they incur a prison sentence going 10 years to the life imprisonment if they are condemned .
in nogales , in arizona , the traffickers exploit vast underground channels of drainage .
the tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of mexico in october , thus posing a challenge for the cartels of drug which must quickly deliver their products to the consumers .
in 2010 , the authorities found a passage approximately 700 yards equipped with railways which left the kitchen of a house of tijuana and went to two warehouses of san diego .

completion of what is primarily the phase of initial destruction is a big step of the ambitious calendar aiming at destroying the chemical weapons of damas by the mid-2014 .
thanks to the destruction of the equipment , syria will not be able to produce new chemical weapons any more .
however , damas must still start the weapons &apos; destruction and of the existing reserves .
it is thought that the country has approximately 1 000 tons of products and chemical weapons , in particular of mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin .
the announcement was made whereas the engagements raged thursday in the town of safira which , according to the experts , shelters a production unit of chemical weapons as well as sites of storage , brought back the syrian observatory of the human rights based in great britain .

the observatory declared thursday that there were losses on the two sides , but did not give any precision .
engagements have underlined importance of dangers with which are confronted inspectors charged with chemical weapons whereas they must to complete their mission , which consists in removing syria from its toxic arsenal in the middle of a civil war which continues , within tight times .

thursday , the oiac said that the two sites were , according to syria , “ given up and … that the elements of the program of chemical weapons which they contained had been moved towards other declared sites , which were inspected ” .

two employees of the marked ymca of sexual assaults following allegations formulated against jonathan lord , at the time of an audience of the royal commission .
two employees of the ymca of news-wales of the south were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations formulated against the teacher to caringbah , jonathan lord , in 2011 , at the time of an audience of the royal commission in charge of the sexual abuses on the children .
but in its declaration of opening before the commission , the ymca declared that it “ had never had to deal with problem of sexual assault on children within his organization ” .
the chief executive officer phillip hare was questioned about two business : an employee of the ymca was accused of infringements relating to the child pornography and a monitor of physical education of the ymca caringbah hall was recognized guilty of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991 .
mr. hare declared in gail furness , legal consultant attached to the commission , which it had had knowledge of the first business but which it was not with the current of the second .
he also admitted that the declaration of opening of the ymca was inaccurate while underlining , “ of external controls of the ymca was carried out and indicated that the security of the children was an absolute priority for the organization . ”
it was shown before the commission which the ymca had been informed that it had received the seconds worse appreciations on four establishments at the time of one to that the quality of department of education and communities carried out in august of this year .
mr. hare , who started to work with the ymca at the 21 years age , admitted that the staff management was a failure with the recruitment of lord and that it had omitted to check that the employees knew that they were held to announce any violation of the security policy of the children .
earlier in the year , lord was condemned for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years when he worked with the ymca .
he was condemned to a 6 years of prison sorrow minimum .
but mr. hare rejected the idea according to which the ymca would have a cultural problem preventing staff from announcing the failures of lord towards the security of the children .
the staff members testified that they had observed certain failures , in particular the fact that lord remained alone with the children , that it kept them into private , made them sit on his knees , told them that it liked them and let them play with its mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , who was framed by lord and who had asked for a formation as regards protection of the children because it worried about its behavior , indicated that it found it responsible for the services to the childhood of the ymca caringbah , jacqui barnat , who very framed lord “ intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time ” .
the chief executive officer said that it rejected testimonies of the staff according to whom they were reticent with the idea to announce these failures to their hierarchically superior .
instead of that , he declared that the friendly relations that they maintained with lord scrambled their judgement , with the result that they did not announce his intrigues .
mr. hare declared that it had expressed his point of view in front of the council of the ymca of news-wales of the south saying that , for the organization , the lesson drawn from “ the incident jonathan lord ” was not to relate to “ the description ” with staff , and the council was of agreement with him .
mr. hare said that the decision to make sign with the staff of the agreements of confidentiality , shortly after that the allegations were evoked , was taken by the chief executive officer of the ymca in charge of the services to childhood , liam whitley .
he declared that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the pieces of evidence but which it acted of a “ overzealousness ” and that it had been badly put in work .
the ymca of news-wales of the south was not a sure organization for the children at the time where jonathan lord was employed there , namely between 2009 and 2011 , declared the expert as regards sexual violences on the children , the professeur stephen smallbone of the university of griffith before the commission .
it indicated that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , control , initiation , the training and the supervision of staff .
the audience was deferred until december 20th .
a ceremony in memory of late crematized
the crematorium of père lachaise organizes , at 11 a.m. , a laic ceremony , in memory of all the late ones crematized in its establishment , during the year .
anne hidalgo , socialist candidate with the town hall of paris must assist to with it , and will explain then , at the time of a press conference his proposals as regards funerary .
to follow the ceremony , click above .
for their own funerals , more and more of french choose the cremation , rather than the burial : 53 % , according to a ipsos study realized september 6th and 7th near 1009 people , instead of 47 % .
for funerals of a close relation , it is the reverse : the french prefer the burial ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
if they have misfortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the cremation .
in its book death in ashes , damien le guay , philosopher and vice-president of the national committee of ethics of funerary , insists on the “ violence ” which the cremation constitutes , for the survivors .
there is , with the cremation , “ a violence made with the liked body ” , which will be “ reduced to a lot of ashes ” in very little time , and not after a process of decomposition , which “ would accompany the phases by mourning ” .
there is also “ a violence symbolic system ” , which is due to the “ obliteration of the singularity and the characteristics ” reduced to the “ anonymity ” of ashes .
why what is accepted without sorrow in certain scandinavian and protestant countries , it is still badly lived in france ?
“ because the cremation is a new fact ” , marie-frédérique bacqué , president of the company of thanatology and author of the book answers to tame death .
it is tolerated only since 1963 by the roman catholic church , which limited the attempts to tame it .
to tame the cremation , it is for françois michaud-nérard , chief executive officer of the funerary services of the town of paris , to envisage for late ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial .
the annual inquiry of ipsos shows a very strong attachment with the organization of the ceremony .
77 % of the french want one of them , for their close relations , that it is nun ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
from now on , 73 % of the people having chosen a cremation wish the organization of a ceremony .
66 % of the atheists or not believers wish it too .
the crematoriums adapted to this evolution of the company .
“ for about ten years , they have endeavoured to avoid with the families the violence of waiting , without anything to make , during one hour and half , immediately followed by the handing-over of ashes ” , mr. michaud-nérard observes .
70 % of the establishments propose from now on masters of ceremony , which proceed , in the presence of the body , with the following ritual : to accommodate the assembly , to name the late one , to connect it to the others , to evoke it , give direction to its death , to organize the good-bye .
it is the case with the crematorium of père lachaise , since 1998 .
the masters of ceremony are often people who reconverted themselves .
there are also former catholic priests .
it is within this framework that the crematorium of père lachaise organizes , since 2010 , the day of all saints &apos; day , several ceremonies of the memory , laymen and nonreligious , to which it invites the families of the people who were crématisées in the year .
for the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies is broadcast enligne , for submission to those which could not make the trip .
the crematorium authorized us to relay it .

on the carpet , also white , in the immense space which is the maisonneuve theatre , of profile , end like a line advances and dressed in black , a body .
on the screen , an ink of henri michaux is projected .
the body , simple feature , takes its form .
and this form will be that of all the part : a row of physical imitations of the drawings .
the dancers , entirely dressed with black , only the hands and the face discovered , expect each side of the playground , precipitate when the next c-w communication appears , incarnate it , arise while running .
this game black and white of henri michaux makes out of relay solos , in group with unison ( a mass which makes solo ) , in great group of twelve solos where each one carries out its sign .
one thinks of “ glory of the morning ” , where , in solo , chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels , posed online with the apron .
it is the same principle , version powerpoint giant .
here , the music is strong , percussions and electric guitars .
energy is high , the always fast rhythm .
it there will have break when carol prieur takes refuge under the carpet of dance , to deliver , microphone in hand , without sobriety nor selected , a share of the poem of michaux , monotonous and monotonous in shouted , and will continue while dancing .
and music to set out again , and the sequence to begin again .
this sound and energetic discharge , long , if that may be , ends up deafening and numbing .
as the fact also regularity of the visual rhythm .
there are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images was always a force at chouinard - as this hair which are dishevelled or these black fabrics which lengthen the lines .
but the choreographic approach misses composition .
one has the feeling that the choreographer , instead of going to the meeting of the work of michaux , asserted herself , with his tics .
result : the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings .
inks of michaux , like forms of gestalt , open imaginary broader and well stocked with game that the dance , more porous .
only the end , into negative , with its dancers chopped by a strobe lighting and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre , touches with the magic .
the public liked , the reception was cordial .
gymnopédies , after the interval , is richer .
the scene is partly draped of gray , the dancers and a piano is covered with fabrics , like furniture in a forsaken house .
with the piano , dancers take turns to play the partitions .
their awkwardnesses in music , touching , give a true brittleness .
on scene , the couples pass , in duets in love , very sensual , even erotic .
work of group , small solos of transitions , units which move , choruses , the writing is binary .
buffoons appear , also familiar of chouinard , raising the red nose , in parades in love very polarized man-women .
the loves are carnivorous , reducing or players .
the gestural one , the laughter and the small cries transpose bleat the antiquated one , the grace and the ridiculous one of the bodies in coitus , of the beings which are based .
but the part takes its real take-off after safety .
a clown returns in scene when the free public .
there , all becomes allowed : the fourth wall falls , the explored universes are superimposed , the dancers cabotinent , goes down among the spectators , annotates , smokes , shorts-circuit itself , plays of the codes of the applause , stretches sauce in a learnedly calculated disorder which remains sensual .
the joy and the madness perspire , and it is the art of chouinard , there , to contaminate the public .

cooper asked martin if he thought seriously that obama did not know that the ousting of biden of the presidential list was examined .
“ perhaps ” , martin answered .

cogeco cable thus encases the step with its competitors , like beautiful , even if the subsidiary of cogeco does not have an exact date yet in what milked with this new platform .
“ it is necessary to adapt and change or resist the change and to fail ” , mr. audet underlined .
the ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers currently do not have access .
giant of telecommunications rogers has already indicated that it could offer netflix so certain technical details , which were not quoted , could be regulated .
in the united states , the popular video service says being in discussions with certain major câblodistributeurs so that its service is available via their platforms of diffusion .
p. - d.g of cogeco and cogeco cables also greeted the announcement carried out by the government to grip at the time of its speech from the throne , on october 16th .
ottawa wishes to force the suppliers of cable television and satellite to give to the customers the opportunity of paying the services with the map .
“ that made about two years and half that we say that the idea to force the consumers to buy important fixed prices of chains , that does not function ” , mr. audet affirmed .
he hopes however that consultations held by the council of broadcasting and canadian telecommunications ( crtc ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
“ it will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of framework of reference new to lay our new canadian cultural policy in what milked on television ” , p . - d.g of cogeco said .
the crtc holds consultations near the public since last week and they should continue with industry next spring .
on the side of the results , cogeco indicated to have recorded a net earning of 43.8 million to the fourth quarters , or 82 ¢ by action .
it is about a retreat compared to the net earning of 44.9 million , or 83 ¢ by action , of the same period last year .
the company established in montreal explains this retreat by costs of depreciation connected to new acquisitions .
cogeco acquired in 2012 the cablodistributor atlantic broadband , bench in the united states , for 1.36 billion .
it was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed portugal .
last december , the company from montreal also bought peer 1 network undertaken , an internet provider established in vancouver , for the sum of 526 million .

they are of 1.8 billion for the financial year in progress .
the net earning of its principal subsidiary , cogeco cables , was of 43.9 million , or 90 ¢ by action , in retreat compared to the 45.7 million , or 93 ¢ by action , of the same period last year .
the incomes of cogeco cable however increased by 45 % to reach 470.4 million .
the company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarters .
however , for the financial year 2013 , the number of customers of cogeco cable is in rise 5546 .
mr. audet does not worry to see the number customers to fluctuate of the kind .
for me , it is not the indication of a change of trend , he observed .
that varies from one quarter to another with a very keen competition .
alexei miller de gazprom declares that the gas pipeline of bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas
the beginning of the construction of the gas pipeline south stream in bulgaria marks the launching of the one of the more energetics great projects of europe , declared the director of gazprom .
“ a historical event took place today : construction started in the bulgarian part of the gas pipeline south stream , the project on a large scale most important of europe ” , explained alexei miller , the chief executive officer of gazprom , in a declaration thursday .
this project is a key element of the energy security of the whole of the continent of europe .
south stream should allow to diversify the ways of export of russia towards europe .
a contractual disagreement between gazprom and its counterpart of ukraine , country by which forwards most of russian gas intended for europe , increases the level of risk compared to the conventional ways , adds the director .
miller added that the direct junction towards bulgaria , member of the european union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with the countries with transit are eliminated “ for always ” .
the bulgarian consumers will receive gas of south stream to a cheap rate as soon as the whole of the project is commissioned in 2015 .
gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries located downstream from here the end of the year .
the gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas .
the unknown ones draw on a hotel near as of pyramids from cairo
the unknown hooded ones opened fire this friday on a hotel close to the pyramids of cairo in egypt without claiming lives , consequence of an apparent quarrel with discharged employees .
the attackers ran away , specified the spokesperson of the ministry for the interior , the general of police abdel latif .
this attack occurs whereas egypt does not receive almost any more any tourist since the army relieved islamist president mohamed morsi at the beginning of july and represses in blood the demonstrations of its partisans .
the schools are encouraged to concentrate more on mathematics , the orthography and grammar
within the framework as of course of english literature , the pupils will have to study at least a shakespearian part , a novel of the 19th century , a romantic poem and a contemporary british work of fiction of 1914 to our days .
the examination will also present “ new texts ” to encourage more diversified reading .
a course combining english literature and language will be removed .
starting from 2015 , the pupils will have to pass an independent gcse of language , and will be strongly incited to choose a qualification separated in english literature .
the ministry of education must publish tomorrow its new programs of english and maths – the first matters to undergo a radical revision .
it will proceed to changes in other fundamental matters the next year .
in addition , ofqual , the regulating office of the examinations , will reveal a rehandling of the structure of the gcse , with a new marking system and less course .
expressing itself during the summer , michael gove , minister for education , declared that there was a “ broad consensus as for the need to reform our system of examinations to restore the confidence of the public ” , while insisting on the fact that the gcse would be “ more stimulative , more ambitious and more rigorous ” .
studies show that the english schools devote less time to the maths ( 116 hours a year , that is to say 3 hours per week during the school year ) that most other countries .
in comparison , the australian schools propose on average 143 hours a year , and the pupils of singapore make approximately 138 hours of them .
although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the timetable to the maths , sources close to the coalition government indicated that the thorough gcse of maths – just as more large significance attached to the matters appearing in the international rankings – would encourage probably the schools to ensure more hours of course .
the program will more focus on the “ problems of the real world ” , in particular financial mathematics .
is the european elite lends to get bargains with great britain ?
the campaign business for britain was launched in april with the promise to join together the companies and to define what the creators of wealths and employment want to see changing in our relation with the eu .
with this intention , we ordered the broadest investigation and most complete to the british entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of great britain , the companies and the eu .
yougov questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , overall representative of all the sizes of companies , of the sectors and areas of great britain .
the conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for much .
we discovered that the vast majority of the companies seek from now on to export apart from europe , while concentrating on the countries which are modernized and developed while the states of the eu stagnate .
they want to see the government giving priority to new commercial links with countries like china , india and brazil rather than to sink in the long and difficult process of reform of the european institutional mysteries .
when one asks them for their opinion on specific political points – energy of the regulation of monopoly to the laws on the products – the majority of the entrepreneurs think that the control of these key competences should turn over to the hands of westminster .
the single market caused a general dissatisfaction , the companies saying that the cost of the brussels regulation is disproportionate compared to the advantages that there is to belong to the european zone of exchanges – 40 % of the large companies , traditionally pro-most european , are even of agreement .
lastly , and what is more still speaking , our investigation near the entrepreneurs revealed that an important majority wanted to see great britain continuing the initiatives in favour of a change of the treaty and development of a relation with the eu based on the trade and not the policy .
this conclusion , which is found in all the great groups and the companies of all sizes , shows that the world of the company insists for a “ significant change ” which gives again the power in the united kingdom .
the challenges are high – to manage to change the treaty and to better represent the interests of great britain would make it possible to see a swing of 16 % of the votes in favour of the maintenance of the country in the eu at the time of a referendum .
the prime minister should not doubt only one moment : this investigation shows that the british companies support this plan aiming at renegotiating the terms of the accession of great britain at the eu .
it also shows that the companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of the power in favour of a return to the hands of the united kingdom .
it is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of the british companies , since the euro zone is committed to an economic and tax union narrower .
the priority must be employment and growth in great britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show it , for the companies that means to again focus on the trade and a fundamental change of the lawful approach of brussels .
beijing blames a turkoman islamic movement
“ the support in slides for the attack came from the islamic movement of eastern turkestan based in central asia and western ” , declared the owner of the units concerned with safety chinese to a tv channel of hong kong , according to a video put online thursday evening on a website .
meng jianzhu , who is member of the political office of the chinese communist party ( pcc ) , expressed himself in tachkent at the time of an official visit as uzbekistan .
it is the first time that a chinese official indicates a particular organization after the attack of monday .
according to the chinese police , three uighur of the same family of the area with dominant muslim of xinjiang , frontier several countries of central asia , precipitated their car charged with petrol cans against the entry from the forbidden city in beijing , in a suicide attack which caused two deaths and 40 casualties .
the driver of the car , his wife and her mother perished in the fire of the car .
etim , which states to fight for the independence of eastern turkestan , old name of chinese xinjiang , was classified by uno in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to al-qaïda .
this movement is often indicated by the chinese authorities as being responsible for the sporadic disorders in xinjiang , but its real influence is put in doubt by several experts .

the firemen are descended in recall along cliff to recover the bitch and to save it of an unquestionable death
a pup was likely to escape worst after the firemen were called to recover it in full safety whereas it was perched to 15 m above ground on the unstable projection of a cliff .

around 14 : 15 wednesday , a person with the sharpened sight which walked its dog located ruby on a cornice in the career , wedged to 15 m above ground .
a technical rescue team of the fire station of cleckheaton is rush on the spot and is descended in recall to save ruby by using a stretcher for animals to transport it until at the top of cliff .
the specialist in the technical helps andy clayton declared : “ it was in a precarious situation . ”

the ukraine approaches the bankruptcy
the standard credit rating agency &amp; poor &apos; s.a lowered friday the note of solvency of the ukraine , putting in doubt the capacity of the soviet ex-republic , in recession since more than one year , to cope with its financial obligations .
the note of the titles of national debt of the country passes to “ b ” , being inserted in the category of the speculative investments .
it is supplied with a negative prospect , s &amp; p seeing at least a chance on three that it is again lowered within one year .
“ it is less and less probable that the strategy of the government makes it possible to guarantee sufficient foreign currencies to cope with its high external financing needs ” , explains the american agency .
the agency raises that monetary reserves of the ukraine fell of 26 % between september 2012 and september 2013 and provides that the trend will continue .
that complicates the refunding of the appropriations taken abroad .
these reserves , to which the authorities resort massively to support the local currency , the hryvnia , crumbling , the agency considers increasingly probable a devaluation , which would inflate its foreign debt .
kiev in addition needs liquidities to regulate its gas importations in russia , which shows it not to have paid an invoice of 882 million dollars .
this announcement constitutes a bad news for the ukrainian power during one time of sharp tensions with its russian , furious neighbor of the will of kiev to sign an association agreement with the eu at the end of november .
it was made public at the following day publication of official statistics showing that the economy of the country had undergone between july and september its fifth quarter of continuation of contraction .
its debt , still relatively modest , exploded these last years and s &amp; p the regard at 33.5 % of the gdp , against less than 10 % before the crisis of 2008-2009 .
the country , in budget deficit , claims since months the assistance of the funds international currency , which had granted to him in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and resolved them for the moment only 3.4 billion .
but the funds refuses to pour all new slice as long as the country will not have adopted reforms unpopular to reduce its deficit , in particular by increasing the prices of gas to the population .
at the conclusion of a new unfruitful mission in the country , the imf noted this week that “ the important requirements in external financing ” constituted “ a vulnerability ” , while raising “ of the signs of improvement economic ” .
however , for the economist oleksandr joloud , of the center of the political studies , “ one cannot expect a short-term improvement ” .
“ there is little hope that unpopular reforms are launched in one year pre-electoral ” , the presidential elections being envisaged in 2015 , raises the expert , questioned in afp .
the only hope , it is an improvement of the international conjuncture .
s &amp; p raises moreover “ uncertainty ” related to the possible signature of an association agreement between the ukraine and the eu , that brussels conditions with the release of adverse ioulia timochenko .
“ to sign the agreement would be positive for the long-term trade but there could be negative consequences with short and medium term related to the reaction of russia ” , explained s &amp; p , which fears “ commercial restrictions ” on behalf of moscow .
russia , which represents the quarter of ukrainian exports , prevented that in the event of creation of a free exchange zone between the eu and kiev , it should reinforce its border controls for the imported goods .
the pawnbrokers of singapore benefit from the middle class forced to tighten the belt
at a pawnbroker of the shopping centre of bendemeer to singapore , janani amirthalinga deposits a bracelet , a ring and a pair of earrings out of gold to pay the school fees of his / her daughters .
“ my husband and me have just bought a house thus all my money left inside ” , mrs. amirthalinga declares .
although it gains 3 000 $ of singapore ( 2 400 $ ) per month as an administrator and that her husband also works , the monthly family income is not enough , she says .
in fact , the request is such in certain parts of southeast asia – where the debt of the households increases – which valuemax , where it carried out its transaction , the third company of loans against security became this week to being introduced at singapore stock exchange .
to pawn jewelry is not only one average rapid to obtain cash – 1 300 $ of singapore in the case of mrs. amirthalinga – but they are almost as cheap as the unguaranteed bank loans .
in general , the pawnbrokers of singapore take an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above 15.4 % offered by united overseas bank , a local money-lender having a branch in the same shopping centre .
however , the pawnbrokers have the advantage of not asking for a checking of solvency or proof of wages , and can resolve the loans more quickly than the banks .
consequently , million people through the area turns to the pawnbrokers whereas the families feel the pressure which exerts the increase in the cost of living and the over-indebtedness of the households and the consumers .
after five years of solid growth since the world financial crisis , and the cheap credit supplied with a monetary policy too laxist in the advanced economies , the families with weak and average income turn to the pawnbrokers to fill the difference whereas their economies know a deceleration .
this week , the standard credit rating agency &amp; poor &apos; s.a quoted the debt growing of the households , rising mainly from the rise of the mortgage financings , like a risk factor for the solvency of the asian banks .
she declared that malaysia , thailand and singapore recorded the ratio debt of the households / the highest gross domestic product of asia .
malaysia arrives top of the list with 80 % of the gdp , whereas this rate rose to 60 % in 2008 .
the economists also fear the elevated level of consumer indebtedness in thailand , which left little this week of a technical recession .
thursday , data showed a continuous weakness of exports and a deceleration of the request of the consumers .
“ the assessment is that with rise in costs , the people in the medium or bottom &#91; of the pay scale &#93; seek to supplement their incomes as they can ” , song seng wun , economist at cimb , a malaysian bank declares .
the historically high prices of gold during two last years made that people hastened to pawn their personal effects to touch the value in cash their jewelry .
in singapore , approximately 70 % of the articles pawned in the 200 shops of loan against security of the city-state are out of gold .
people say , “ the ransom price is high , pawn the gold chain of grandmother and one will return to seek it the next month ” .
in thailand , the largest operator of shops of loan against security , easymoney , recorded a rise of 20 % amongst customers using his shops during last months .
the rise is such in the sector of the loan against security that valuemax , operator of the shop with bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in singapore , envisages to develop not only in close malaysia – where it counts already four shops – but also apart from asia , yeah lee ching declares , its chief executive officer .
the company will finance them by using 60 % of the 66 m $ of singapore which it raised this week during its introduction to singapore stock exchange .
while certain lenders withreduced tax wiped criticisms for exorbitant interest rates which they use , miss yeah indicates that the setting guarantees offer of it not only rates less low than the other lenders , but that in more it does not increase the debt directly .
“ the customers mortgage goods which they have already , and the fact of monetizing their personal goods does not increase the debt of the households ” , she says .
the setting in pledge is better and better accepted socially like means of obtaining a financing guaranteed in the short run .
the people who go to the pawnbrokers are not either only those which have financial problems .
easy people of singapore also go in the shops of loan against security valuemax to pawn gold ingots or rolex watches , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash .
we see customers of all the layers of the company .
“ it can be easy people who need to borrow in the short run for marketing activities or investments , or small companies which have needs for treasury to pass a difficult course ” , miss yeah adds .
sometimes , they have right need for money very quickly .

basharat ditta , 42 years , gave sensitive information to the lord of the crime neil scarbrough concerning of the investigations on its linked activities with the drug trafficking after being itself compromised because of its practice to consume cocaine .
the lawyer , who was called “ bash ” and was regarded by the criminals as a “ file of first importance ” , was stopped at his place in 2011 following operations of listening of the police directed towards scarborough , which it had represented at the time of a previous lawsuit in relation to the drug trafficking .
the police officers located sarborough , 32 years , depositing three bags of cocaine in the residence of lawyer with blackburn , in lancashire , whereas it attended a dinner of the bar with fellow-members .
the investigations revealed that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of this drug of class a after tests showed traces of cocaine in its hair , on its wallet and its credit cards .
over one eight month period between january and august 2011 , he sought to obtain in an illicit way of information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough like one of his associates .
the four suspects were supervised at the time by the police within the framework of an important investigation into a traffic of heroin and cocaine proceeding in the counties of lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire terrier .
with 32 other men , they were imprisoned thereafter after the police seized of heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 m £ , like more than 200 000 £ in cash during a series of raids .
ditta , 42 years , provided information to the criminals because it feared that its drug-addiction is revealed at the great day .
today , to the court of assizes of liverpool , ditta , which works in the law firm forbes solicitors located at blackburn , fell in disgrace after being recognized guilty on two counts of indictment of obstacle to justice after a three weeks lawsuit .
he had admitted the cocaine possession during a previous audience .
the fall of lawyer occurred after the police , inquiring into scarborough , discovered that it had been regularly in telephone contact with ditta in february 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspect and located it arriving at the residence of ditta and placing drug , pure to 60 % , under the dustbins of lawyer in a glove of black golf .
little time after the deposit , scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with ditta which was with a dinner at the football stadium of ewood park , enclosure of the club of the blackburn rovers .
the lawyer is turned over at his place , discovered drug and they were telephoned nine recoveries .
the court heard that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this drug of class a in its hair , on its wallet and its credit cards .
ditta was stopped later but denied to consume cocaine . he declared that he had spoken to the supposed drug trafficker because it was its customer and made the point that their discussions were subjugated with a “ legal privilege ” .
during its arrest , ditta collected its wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards , but they all were seized and a sample of hair was taken to him .
at the time of a interrogation , he declared that he had an office in his residence , just as with his workplace and than it happened that customers call it at his place for questions of legal order .
but the court heard testimonies according to which it called principal actors in the trade of the drug , of which some which it had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investigators were with the current .
the prosecutor anne whyte declared : “ if somebody must know that the law should not be violated , it is well a lawyer specialist in criminal law . ”
mr. ditta is shown to have misused his position as a lawyer specialist in criminal law , and to be itself too much implied near particular customers .
the relation about which we speak is not simply a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker providing of drug to his own lawyer .
some of its communications will be without any doubt of the legitimate communications because it was its lawyer .
but that went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relation between a lawyer and his customer .
it blocked the investigation of the police as much as it could to enable him to continue its criminal activities .
mr. ditta did not make honor with his profession , but dishonoured it .
it approached certain customers too much , in particular scarborough , and it let compromise its independence .
ditta denied any illegal dealing and declared : “ if i were a corrupted lawyer , which i am not , and if i had wanted to provide information to mr. scarborough , i would not have waited 15 hours , i would have done it immediately . ”
but after the audience , superintendant it lee halstead of the police of lancashire declared : “ mr. ditta passed from lawyer specialist in criminal law to criminal himself since it started to get drug near criminal organizations . ”
its addiction with cocaine compromised it forever and made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives leader members of the organized criminal groups which charged it with obtaining invaluable information concerning of the investigations of police .
the lawyers should observe the most strict rules of integrity and found a climate of trust near the public .
mr. ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to shelter behind varnish of his profession .
the unit in charge of the serious and organized crime of lancashire investigated mr. ditta , who was recognized guilty of the three counts of indictment of cocaine possession and maintaining of obstacle to justice , testifying to his commitment to continue the criminals in justice .
that this business serf of warning to the criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law .
we will find you and will translate for you in front of the courts .
scarborough itself was imprisoned during 14 years after having pled guilty of complicity of traffic of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
thirty-five other people implied in the traffic were condemned to a 153 years of prison total for drug trafficking .
on its site , ditta organized a questions session / answers on itself during which he said that his job of dreamed would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the corridor of death in america , its last guest to dine would be mohammed ali and the inequality would be what would justify it to work .

one year difficult for the pharmacists
the departure of almost 10 pharmacists at the health centre and social services ( csss ) of laval because a whole agitation with the direction of the hospital of city-of-the-health , and this , at the time of the year 2012-2013 .
because of multiple departures to the retirement , maternity leave or departures very short , the department of pharmacy was strongly overdrawn as a staff .
it missed nearly 30 % of manpower necessary , making this year financial “ very difficult ” , according to the chief of the department , gillian beaudet .
however , the csss decided not to engage of independent labour , which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time committed pharmacist .
one did not have recourse to the breakdown service , explained mrs. beaudet .
one rationalized or decreased some of our activities inside the establishment for stage , time that the things are replaced .
it is sure that one worked extremely to interest our young people &#91; resident in pharmacy &#93; so that they come and remain here .
there is a coincidence which made that one was in a bad situation the last year .
improved situation
after this difficult period , year 2013-2014 is announced definitely easier for the department of pharmacy of the csss .
already , three pharmacists are of return to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists were engaged during last months .
moreover , the efforts made by the department in order to retain bore fruits , because the four pupils at present in residence in laval also decided to remain with the use of the csss .
now , that is much better , underlined the pharmacist .
from here the financial end of the year , we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity .
that will thus come to fill our departures of the last year .
always increasing needs
the situation remains however delicate .
several factors , like the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a prevalence of young women in the trade , make situations such as that lived in 2012 difficult to envisage .
for us &#91; the number of manpower &#93; is always precarious , because there is a medium which is young and many young women are employed , therefore with the pregnancies , one almost always rolls to three maternity leave when that is well , she added .
the last year , one had of it much more and one does not have pharmacists who are available to make replacements , therefore it was more difficult .

anger caused by the sorrow pronounced against one of the bomb planters of bali
the survivors and the close relations of the 202 people killed in the attacks of bali in 2002 reacted with anger to the sorrow pronounced against the last of the conspirators to being translated into justice , saying that umar patek should be shot by a firing squad .
patek , which spent almost 10 years leaks some while being one of the most searched men of southeast asia , was condemned yesterday to a 20 years of prison sorrow for its role in the manufacturing of the explosive devices used at the time as of attacks .
it could be released at the end of 15 years under release on parole .
man of 45 years has be recognized guilty of slaughter of mass for attacks aiming two nightclubs in tourist area popular of kuta , which caused the death of 202 people , including 88 australian , and made many casualties .
he was also recognized guilty many other counts of indictment in relation to terrorism , in particular a wave of attacks aiming of the churches in all indonesia the day before christmas in 2000 .
the prosecutors asked for a sorrow of life imprisonment , however they could have asked so that the man , qualified “ man demolition ” for his reputation of expert in manufacturing of bombs , be prisoner under sentence of death .
the decision revived painful memories for june corteen , a mother of perth who lost his two 39 year old binoculars , jane and jenny , in the destruction perpetrated by patek and the other conspirators there is nearly 10 years .
at the edge of the tears , she declared that patek should have been prisoner under sentence of death .
i really think that it should have followed the same way as the other men .
“ it should be trailed in front of the firing squad ” , mrs. corteen with the aap declared .
i must live the every day without having other grandchildren , nor to see my daughters .

there sank in the coma the shortly after the attack and remained unconscious for one month , and he “ died ” three times whereas he was under respiratory assistance .
mr. hugues declared that patek should have known the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell of jemaah islamiyah responsible for carnage – amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra – who were carried out 4 years ago .
actually , this man should have been prisoner under sentence of death before the others .
to keep in life , why , there is no reason to keep it in life .
to spend 20 years in prison after having killed 202 people and having wounded hundreds of others , it is not much .
patek is the last of the bomb planters of bali to being translated into justice .
it had succeeded in avoiding being made capture during almost 10 years but was finally stopped in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where the american forces will kill the former chief of al-qaïda , oussama ben laden , less than four months later .

“ it did not go ” , mrs. corteen added .
until recently , he made fun passionately of the sorrow which he had been able to cause with other people .
the verdict was returned the day before the 10th birthday of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and will be marked by ceremonies in bali and in australia .
“ there will be many tears this year ” , mme corteen said .
patek can however appeal against its judgment .

since his departure in june 2007 after one decade in charge of the country , mr. blair largely avoided discussing the british policy , limiting his comments to the foreign affairs and his role of special correspondent of the quartet for the peace process in the middle east .
when it was asked to him whether he would like to find the post of prime minister , mr. blair would have answered , according to standard evening of london : “ yes , of course , but it can probable that arrives , therefore … ”

imbroglio around the closing of the urgencies of the hospital
vis-a-vis the sling carried out since several months by part of staffs and several trade unions , whose cgt , the minister for health , marisol touraine , had decided on july 10th “ to shift the calendar of implementation of the project , and in particular the date of closing of the urgencies which will not be able to intervene on november 4th ” .
a request officially made “ not to run any risk on the assumption of responsibility of the urgencies to paris at the beginning of the winter ” but which also aimed at not obstructing the countryside of the ps in a few months of the local elections .
in spite of the ministerial instructions , closing should be effective all the same on this date .
even if , with the aphp , one prefers to employ the term of “ transformation ” or of “ change in continuity ” .
starting from november 4th , the firemen  who ensured approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages the urgencies of the hospital  will have received all for instruction to take along about thirty serious cases per day towards the urgencies of other parisian hospitals .
this dated november 4th also corresponds to the renewal of the boarding schools .
with the hospital , the interns specialized in urgencies will leave room monday to five interns of general medicine .
as for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine , it is programmed for the current of the month .
“ the service of reception of the urgencies of the hospital must close as soon as possible , and for us , it is on november 4th ” , ensures without turning loïc capron , the president of the medical commission of establishment ( cme ) of the aphp , which supports the project of the direction .
“ on november 4th , there will be no more patients brought by the firemen , only of the people coming by their own means ” , confirms professor jean-yves fagon , the medical person in charge of the new hospital .
“ but we will continue to accommodate patients in urgency ” , he moderates , putting forward the permanent presence of vehicles of the smur on the spot to transfer the serious cases .
doctors a &amp; e doctors seniors will remain on the spot , he also ensures .
but it is with the ars that it belongs to decide the closing of the service of reception of the urgencies .
“ the things are done gradually ” , answers nicolas péju , spokesperson of the ars for which , on november 4th , “ it will not have there change in terms of done favour . ”
“ the minister lied us or one lied to him ” , the doctor a &amp; e doctor gérald kierzek regrets .
dislocated of its post of head of the smur to have carried out the sling against the reorganization project at the beginning of july , it is defined as a “ launcher of alarm ” vis-a-vis a “ cynical ” decision catch by “ medical and administrative technostructure ” .
“ they are emptying and to asphyxiate urgencies which were renovated there is less than five years ” , he estimates .
for him , “ if the other parisian services of urgencies could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem ” .
however they are regularly blocked .
for example sometimes nine hours ago of waiting to the urgencies of lariboisière .
with the ars , one makes the point that thirty patients “ dispatchés ” on several sites are not likely to represent a “ avalanche ” in the other services of urgencies , whose human means will in addition have been reinforced .
with the ars as with the aphp , one defends the “ new hospital model ” already started since october 7th and which should continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year .
by the end of the year , liberal general doctors should also come to take part in the installation of a “ permanence of ambulatory care ” .
“ where one goes if one asks people auto--to diagnose oneself ” , questions gérald kierzek for whom “ the concept urgently not engraves ” is “ dangerous ” and marks a “ medical regression ” .
that will occur as for maternities from level 3 .
people are not insane , they will go where there is the best offer of care .
if the minister does not take a measure by monday , we will change gear ratio , warns christophe prudhomme , doctor a &amp; e doctor and member of cgt health .
we will be even more present within the framework of the municipal countryside and we will reflect to present a list .
in the team of nathalie kosciusko-morizet , vincent roger , ump advisor of paris and elected official of the 4th district , announcement clearly that “ even if ump parisian were for the maintenance of the urgencies to the hospital , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if one returns to the responsibilities ” .
anne hidalgo , the candidate ps , as for it again recalled monday morning on france inter that it had decided in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closing on november 4th .
if it were the case , it would mark its dissension net , underlines bruno julliard , his spokesperson .
even if the reorganization of the hospital has its legitimacy on the bottom , we cannot admit it without an acceptable diagram of carryforward towards the other hospitals .

with each book , the same receipt : a great amount of geopolitics and exoticism , some scenes of sex hardware , a zest of violences and tortures .
“ i never claimed to be a literary author ” , explained gérard de villiers .
i regard myself as a storyteller who writes to distract from people to which i do not send a message .

the father of sas said “ to make a kind of geopolitical serial ” .
“ i am permanently my files ( afghanistan , syria , … ) before leaving ” , gérard de villiers added .
on the spot , i meet journalists , of which those of afp , diplomats , people of the services that i know for some since twenty or thirty years .
